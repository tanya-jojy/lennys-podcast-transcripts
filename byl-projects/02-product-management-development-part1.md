# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast. Prior to this, she was VP and head of product at Charlie Health, senior director of product at Drift, director of product at BevSpot, a product manager at TripAdvisor. She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was also an Olympic speed skater, which is insane and incredibly cool. And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.

(00:01:44):
I'm excited for you to learn from her like I did. With that, I bring you Maggie Crowley after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Productroadmap.ai and ignition Productroadmap.ai is the first AI roadmapping suite. It helps ensure roadmaps drive revenue by instantly aligning product with your sales and marketing teams to capture upsell opportunities. Built by early leaders from Rippling and Craft, it automatically identifies feature gaps from your CRM data and your customer conversations, adds them to shareable roadmaps, easily prioritized by revenue impact, and then seamlessly closes the loop with sales reps via targeted notifications when feature gaps are closed. As part of Ignition's broader go-to market operating system, Productroadmap.ai can also help create better handoffs and collaboration with product marketing teams by giving both teams the tools to research, plan, orchestrate and measure the process of building products and going to market. Packed with integrations, AI automation and communication tools. It's truly a one-stop shop for product and marketing to bring things from concept to launch.

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:00):
We rarely get a peek into what it's like to work at TikTok. What are some core principles or values or just how TikTok operates?

Ray Cao (00:00:07):
The number one thing is context, no control. That's the reason why we're always encouraging people to see themselves as a business owner.

Lenny (00:00:14):
You give them all the information they need and then let them just do things without specific instructions.

Ray Cao (00:00:18):
How do you actually solve the puzzle by connecting all the dots together? Just like how I see some of my friends, their kids playing Legos, if you don't really see the full picture, you won't be able to make the Lego as one thing at the end of the day. You have to see the other pieces.

Lenny (00:00:31):
What else are important cultural values of TikTok, of how TikTok operates that everyone always has in mind when they're building?

Ray Cao (00:00:36):
We always have this mentality we are a startup, we're a young company, we're always hungry for growth. And a very wacky way is like, "How can I run my second half of my marathon faster than the first half?"

Lenny (00:00:49):
Today my guest is Ray Cao. Ray is the global Head of Monetization Product Strategy & Operations at the Global at TikTok where he has been for over four years. Prior to TikTok, Ray spent six years at Google helping scale Google shopping globally.

(00:01:05):
TikTok is interesting for two big reasons. One, it's one of the most successful businesses in history, last valued at over $80 billion. And its parent company is the most valuable private company in the world, last valued at over $200 billion.

(00:01:19):
Two, TikTok is quickly becoming one of the biggest advertising platforms alongside Meta and Google, and generated nearly $10 billion in advertising revenue just a couple of years ago. So for both these reasons, TikTok is a really interesting business and team to learn from. And I've seen very few podcasts and even media get a peek inside how TikTok operates.

(00:01:39):
In our conversation, we discuss TikTok's culture, their core principles and values, how they hire, how they move so fast, their emphasis on working hard, how they do OKRs and planning. We also get into how to succeed on TikTok's ad network, why you want to be testing at least 10 videos a week, how it's different from running ads on Instagram, how to make content that does well on TikTok, and so much more. This episode has a lot of interesting lessons and insights. Obviously TikTok is at the center of a lot of debate globally. Some people love it, some people hate it. But no matter your opinion of TikTok, there's a lot that we can learn from their success.

(00:04:55):
Ray, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Ray Cao (00:05:00):
Thank you Lenny for having me. It's a pleasure.

Lenny (00:05:02):
It's my pleasure. I am really excited to have you here because it feels like we rarely get a peek into what it's like to work at TikTok, how TikTok builds product and operates, also how to be successful in TikTok as a business, as an advertiser. So I have all these kinds of questions for you, and so I'm really happy to be chatting. I wanted to start with a little bit about your time before TikTok, which was at Google and comparing that to TikTok. So, you're at Google for six years, I believe. Now you're at TikTok. I'm curious on what stood out to you about the cultural differences between how Google operates and TikTok operates.

Ray Cao (00:05:37):
Three major things, I would say. Number one is really how these two company thinking about innovation. So, I think Google has a very strong philosophy of we're engineering lab and that there's a lot of technology-driven, and a lot of pieces. They are not necessarily always trying to, I would say, cope with the market even, right? However, I think at the TikTok, I think besides the technology part, we do have a very keen, I would say, appetite to really understand what the markets really want and also how can we really service our clients in a better way and the clients here is not necessarily only for advertisers including our user and also creator altogether. So that's one of the things I think it's very different in terms of TikTok way of work. It's very customer-centric in a way, and again, the customer here is not necessarily only for the business partner but also for our regular user and creators on the platform.

(00:06:39):
And the second one is really thinking about how we take approach on product development. So a lot of times that we take a very rigid approach in terms of product development and oftentimes you see us that experimenting a lot of different things all the same time. And also we do have a lot of engineering and [inaudible 00:07:04] project in the backend to really understand how can we optimize better for the platform. So a lot of time, these are the things that I think TikTok is doing really, really well.

(00:07:14):
The last piece I have to say is the approach for global prioritization. A lot of times that you see a US-born company go global and oftentimes still they are really rooted with the US market and there's nothing wrong with it to be honest, because this is the biggest market for them as I would say for East-born company. I think a lot of times that we can take approach with truly how do we think about globalization and for example, we launched a lot of product not necessarily first in North America. We launched it in South Asia for example, for our shopping, really very big initiative internally for shopping and we launched our really creator fund here in North America. We launched our gaming approach, really serviced our EUI gaming advertisers. Really, really strong over there. So there are a lot of different approach in terms of how do we prioritize our go-to-market and also product development. So that's the part I feel like we're very unique in the market or unique to some of that was the tech company born in the US.

Lenny (00:08:24):
It reminds me there's this piece by this smart guy, Eugene Wei who wrote a few things about TikTok over the years and just why it's been so successful and one of his really big points is that TikTok can work really well in other markets 'cause it's basically... you don't need to know a ton about the market because it's this algorithm that figures out what people in each market want. Is there anything along those lines you've seen that just has been really fundamental to it working so well in many different markets?

Ray Cao (00:08:51):
The algorithm is definitely helping because it is basically the machine is doing a lot of heavy lifting. That's actually I think across the board on a technology company today. The difference is actually how much you are willing to take the heavy lifting over there in the market. By that I mean really sending your troops into the market, hiring your local talent, understanding the culture and really understanding the behavior from those users. I understand the machine can do things, but also at the same time that we need to actually get local talent to fine tune the machine. So there are a lot of conversations about how I would say technology is able to change our life, but I do think that at the end of the day, I do believe technology is a tool.

(00:09:34):
So if we do have a ambition to go global, you have to do one more thing is actually take your step into global. Rather than having the machine do the heavy lifting, you have to really understand in local culture. I had a fun background for my first job is to really doing go-to market research in the Southeast Asia area. I think there was only one thing opened my eyes after a year and a half in this career path is different market have totally different, I would say, culture and these market behaviors are actually coming out of this culture. One of the fun example I always been using was I was doing market research for one of the suppliers for toner and also these ink cartridges for Thailand as a go-to market research. One of the things is always concern to my, at that point, the client was they cannot figure out why their premium product cannot sell in Thailand and then we just figure out because the quality of their printing machine and also their ink cartridges are premium and the quality of the paper and everything is very good.

(00:10:51):
But when you actually do talk to those consumers in those market, the answer is very eye-opening. They literally told me at that time is I don't care. I don't care if your ink cartridges or your printer is at the premium quality, maybe the printer I can use, but I can use compatible ink cartridges or toner for that because my consumer won't care about your printing quality or the majority of my consumer won't care. So in that case you should not necessarily worried about if you are a premium product, it's actually more about how durable, how reliable you're able to print things and people can read.

(00:11:30):
So I think these are the insights I think a lot of times it will be neglected from some of clients or the manufacturers or even the owner of the business because they think that we want to serve this segmentation, but, however, this segmentation is that big in this area. So that's reason why the culture is really the key part from the market. If you don't understand the culture, you won't be able to understand the behavior over there. It's more about that, I think, when we say about globalization or take the product go to market in a global scheme or even build it apart, you have to get your hands dirty and to really understand the local culture so that you can understand local behavior.

Lenny (00:12:16):
I love that advice, the way you described it, which I love also is that you kind of have to fine-tune the algorithm and the product to work in different cultures. Is there an example of how that was done with TikTok, like a tweak that had to be made or some kind of fine-tuning that happened for it to work in a different market?

Ray Cao (00:12:32):
Yeah. I think we did a lot of fine-tuning on our user product side to really think about content. So that's the number one thing going to be super different coming from each of the market and also from each of the culture. For example in Japan, how do you actually get more content that relevant for the culture? A lot of people may think, okay, are you guys only doing dancing or doing singing for Japan? The answer is not. It is actually more food on the TikTok side, like how do you actually introducing new food restaurant or new recipes and also sometimes that you're introducing a new technology. I would say 3C like consumer electronics product over there. So these are the content get really popular sometimes in Southeast Asia or even Japan area and versus in the US as everybody knows that we're starting from really lip-syncing at a very early stage but now really we're expanding to shopping behaviors and also a lot of people using us as a main platform to acquire new discovery for the product.

(00:13:40):
So these are the things I think different market definitely deserves and demand different kind of treatment and if you are able to do this a lot, you're able to find success over there.

Lenny (00:13:53):
That's really interesting because you could think it's just this algorithm that figures everything out for you, but I think what you're pointing out is you have to seed it with the right sorts of use cases that that culture is most excited about.

Ray Cao (00:14:04):
Another good example will be creative, so it's a very good example how human can work with technology together. We have a ton of creatives and we have a ton of content so, of course, we use machine to label those content use metadata to analyze those content. However, a lot of times you can find that when we're really thinking about how creative can help advertisers? Humans actually make a more interesting or more, I would say, influencing decisions over there. For some of the verticals we can say that, "Oh, you know what, maybe we can try a coupon image with a new product like a sticker on the top?" This maybe actually work better compared to some of the price promotion even. So a lot of things really depends on how do you actually interpreting the numbers and interpreting the data points but also at the same time your business acumen is going to be very important here to make a judgmental call for some of the situation like that. I think we're still rely a lot on both machine and also our own experts to analyzing those trends and give it the recommendations.

Lenny (00:15:11):
Awesome. Okay, so there's a few threads I'm going to follow later. You talked about the product development process, so I'm going to want to spend time there, also about how to be successful in TikTok both as a creator also as a business, I'm excited to hear your advice there. But I want to spend a little more time first on just what it's like to work within TikTok and the culture of TikTok. What are some core principles or values or just how TikTok operates if you had to identify, here's the ways that we all think about what we want to do and the most important to your day-to-day work, what words and concepts come to mind?

Ray Cao (00:15:43):
The number one thing resonating really, really well with me is context, no control. Oftentimes when we are looking around companies different sizes, we're looking at how to collaborate. Oftentimes we see the behavior that a lot of people just working on a smaller piece based off their job description. So hey, you're working on go-to-market and you're working on data analytics, and you're working on this book of business and commerce, and you're working on auto industry for example. A lot of times that these human-made silos is actually slowing things down because humans are not, or our talent, they're not supposed to be categorized into different basket. They may have their own majority responsibility for sure, but we don't want to cap them into this kind of a box we created. That's really why we're always encouraging people to think out of the box and think more and think themselves as a business owner rather than a piece of machine that keep the machine running.

(00:16:49):
Oftentimes that will say context, no control. That means you actually can go above and beyond to really think about your whole business problem as your own problem and your piece is maybe one part of it to solve the puzzle, but how do you actually solve the puzzle by connecting all the dots together, we're encouraging all the people to think like that way and by that I think we kind of mentally break out those walls. So encouraging our team members to do a little bit more thinking is very important. It's a little bit more thinking because the think part is very important.

(00:17:23):
And then, now in terms of getting things into behavior or changes or getting to action, then you need to really collaborate with other teams because we don't want to necessarily creating, hey, you're on other people's working group now you're actually stepping on other people's toes now. It is not the situation we're trying to encourage in, but where it's encouraging more is context, no control, think more about how you can change it and then we you do really actually take some actions, be active. You reach out to who's supposed to be the owner of that and then have a discussion so then you you're able to connecting the dots altogether.

(00:18:00):
So that's one thing I think it's very unique to our culture. I think it's very, very important for us to continue to grow at this speed because everybody have a, I would say, full visibility towards our full ownership to their mindset, how they can contribute.

Lenny (00:18:16):
And the key there is context implying you give them all the information they need and then let them just do things without giving them specific instructions, "Hey, I need you to hit this goal, work on this project, launch this thing. Here is what we know, do the things you think are best, roughly." Right now, I know it's not just like anyone does anything, but I imagine that's kind of the implication there.

Ray Cao (00:18:35):
Yeah, I think it's context, no control plus proactive thinking and reactive doing so you have to do more proactive thinking with these contexts. Now reactive doing means that you need to collaborate, but when everybody has this kind of mindset, the collaboration should be very smooth because people have the context altogether. The part that I see maybe some of the other company are facing challenges is actually there's too many IOs in between and you have people that are just protecting their own thing and working their own thing and then I'm delivering. But just like how I see some of my friends, their kids playing Legos, if you don't really see the full picture, you won't be able to make the Lego as a one thing at the end of the day. You have to see the other pieces. So that's the part I think it's really powerful and reasoning really, really well when we're really thinking about product development and also product go-to-market. So it's a pretty full cycle. People have to see this and then they have the context.

Lenny (00:19:35):
I love this, and this has come up actually a few times recently when I was talking to the CTO of Netflix and also OpenAI. They're very similar in culture where it's give people a lot of autonomy and freedom and not a lot of do this, do this, do this. The key there is to hire very high quality people and very high caliber people because if not, then things won't work out too great. Is there anything along those lines that you can share just like yeah, the kinds of people you end up hiring and how you hire people that can work well in that environment?

Ray Cao (00:20:05):
I agree with you. So the caliber of these people is actually pretty important to support the structure I just talked about, and oftentimes I can see some people that with the quality of always curious. Curiosity is a very important quality when I'm actually talking to my interviewers because I want to see that they are naturally curious to new things. They want to learn more about the new things and don't really get stuck with their own things. That's one thing. And the other thing is the discipline because like I said, it is actually a double-edged sword in this case. So it could potentially introducing some of the chaotic situation in a company because everybody is thinking everything. The discipline here is actually how you are really following the guidance on reactive doing, be always thinking about how to collaborating, and the discipline here and also the rigorous approach here is also going to be very important.

(00:21:07):
One of the good example that is the ability to prioritize because I don't believe one thing is everybody can do everything. You have to prioritize properly so that you're able to push the right agenda. So I think that's more of the quality of the people we're looking for is... it is hard, don't get me wrong. It is really hard to say that we can find everyone like that, but we would love to believe that we can train our employees like that so that they're able to even do better in their longer-term career.

Lenny (00:21:38):
Essentially what you look for when you're hiring people is making sure they're always curious, they have high discipline, and that they prioritize well. Coming back to the cultural pieces of TikTok, so the main one you've shared so far is this idea of context, not control. What else are important cultural values of TikTok, of how TikTok operates that everyone always has in mind when they're building and new meetings, making decisions?

Ray Cao (00:22:04):
Yeah, another internal thing that we always say is always day one, we want to make sure that we always have this mentality we are a startup. We are a young company. We're always hungry for growth. We don't want to fall into the trap that people may think, "Oh, you guys are very successful in the market and then you are not necessarily need to worry about your existence anymore." I think it is actually something we're trying to avoid. We always want to make sure that in our team members always think like, "Okay, if this is actually a new day for you, I know what other things that you always want to keep in your mind you want to do." And also to keep that spirit is very important.

(00:22:42):
A lot of times that I can see some of the mature company, they're not necessarily losing the edge of, I would say this competition or losing the edge of being innovative. I think it's more about some of the culture has been shifted because you have a lot of new employees that live in your culture. So not necessarily it's not going to be like the old days that the co-founder is sitting among you, but I do think this company has a very interesting behavior. I see there is I can talk to anyone at any time via our internal communication system. I can ping Shuo right now. I can ping the co-founder if I want to tomorrow.

(00:23:24):
We always keep this kind of mentality internal is that we're still a young company, we want to grow and you can feel free to talk to anyone. We don't have a limitation for that as long as you have a good opinion, I would love to hear from you. Is that creating some of the, I would say chaotic situation? It might be, but I do think that this keeps the company very energetic. People are willing to share, people are willing to engage. That's very important.

(00:23:50):
I want add one more thing. We just talked about, you asked me what is actually the uniqueness of TikTok versus the other company. It's very tied up to that is I have never seen a company, the engineering team and the product team and the sales team are so close. That's definitely one of aha moments I had because if you're thinking about if your engineer does not really know what the market wants and if your PM doesn't really know what is actually the client's feedback, they won't be able to get a right product in the market. They just won't be. And they won't even tell a good go-to-market story to advertisers or even to our users because they just don't know what the end users are thinking.

(00:24:39):
So I think it's a very secret sauce for us is that our sellers and our engineering team and our product team and also data scientist team, we're all collaborating really, really closely and that's very much, I would say a such big advantage for us compared to when a company becomes too big and nobody talks to each other. So I do hope that it is the thing that we're going to continue reinforce along the years where we'll continue to grow the company.

Lenny (00:25:09):
What does that actually look like? I imagine people hearing this are like, "Yeah, we're going to make sales and product and hinge very close." I imagine many people don't actually do this too well. How do you actually execute that? Is it they report to the same leader, they sit next to each other or I don't know, zoom next to each other? What actually makes that work?

Ray Cao (00:25:28):
Yeah, I think a couple of things. Number one is a structure. Everything has to go at a structure. So we do have a meeting structure that we called it... it used to be by month and now it's actually a quarterly level. We get everybody together, engineering leader, product leader, and also not necessarily only the leader level. Some of the team members, we're joining the force together to have a big meeting. That meeting is 180 people-ish. It's crazy to have a meeting at that size, especially that there are different kind of functionality there. But one thing we keep really well is actually we are using a reading format of meeting. So it's a doc reading. We just read in comments and understanding the context again. It is the doc, bring everybody together, and then we discuss the things that we want to make a decision with or the things that we feel is a blocker or things that we need to celebrate.

(00:26:24):
So that meeting structure keep everybody together and consensus, again, not necessarily only for the top leaders. It's normal for the engineering leader and product leader and sales leader at the company level, they talk to each other, but we made that happen for their core team members. And the very beginning of my time here, that was literally getting to the IC level. So it is pretty eye-opening for me to join that meeting first time because I was get so used to their level of different meetings at Google, but here it's like, okay, everybody read one documentation and then you just understand what are people talking about or thinking about. It is intentional. But I do think that that structure is a very big secret sauce, I would say, not necessarily we invented it, right? We also learned from the other companies. So it is actually one of the things that we actually deployed pretty well today here to keep that structure running.

(00:27:22):
And the other thing is really feed those, I would say, first-hand market information to our PMs and RDs. That means we took them out with us. We're just inviting them together to join the force together to meet the clients and a lot of the company, if you want to meet APMs, if you want to meet the engineering leaders, it's literally once a year maybe, and also if you're investing a ton with some of the platforms. For us, I think it's always on to junior PMs, senior PMs and engineering leaders. We invited them together to these immersion trips recorded to really get face time with our clients, to really feel the heat. They are actually really facing a challenge by using our own product.

(00:28:07):
So that kind of, I would say, the aha moment is bringing a lot of, I would say, insights to them and also get them to feel the heat of the pains the sellers may feel. So that worked really well, too. I think oftentimes it is a battle. It is not necessarily the general, you have to stay in the back, you sometimes have to go to the front, but we just make sure that the general go to the front quite often in our company to do that.

Lenny (00:28:36):
I love that concept of having them feel the heat. An interesting trend I've noticed is there's a lot of Amazon influence on the way you all operate. It's always day one idea. There's the memo culture you just described. Any idea where that comes from? Is there like a senior Amazon person that came in and helped influence those sorts of things? Is it just hey, Amazon's killing in there? I've noticed interestingly, Amazon has influenced the most companies in all of their ways of working, so it's not a surprise. I'm just curious if there's anything else there that's interesting.

Ray Cao (00:29:04):
I think we have the benefits to standing on the shoulder of all the giants. So we learned definitely always there when the culture that Amazon was always championing, I think we learned from them. So this is something that we, I would say, always trying to listen and trying to learn from industry. The dark fashion is also learned from Amazon, so we kind of studied, oh, this is maybe one of the best practices we can employ here, how we deploy here. So we tried it, not even mentioned we have the OKR system, so it is actually a very good learning from our early stage from Google. So all these, I think definitely we do have some of the, I would say, benefits being the newcomer to the market and then learn a lot of the best practices coming from our industry peers and really deployed here hopefully successfully.

(00:29:53):
And some of the things that we just tweaked. So for example our culture always day one is definitely very similar to Amazon, but the implementation of that could be different. And also the context, no control piece is, I believe other companies may have the similar idea, but for us I think we just really need to implement it in a way that's going to be fitting to us. I happened to listen to your podcast with the Airbnb co-founder the other day. He also mentioned that how he break out the IOs. I think it is very similar approach among industry right now trying to really make sure the team is able to talk to each other because I think a quote from him, "If your PM doesn't know how to sell the product they're creating, you won't be able to do your job better." So this is literally how we're thinking about it, too, in a lot of way.

Lenny (00:30:40):
I know that you all move very fast and I want to actually talk about that next. And with that it feels like your value should be, it's always the first half of the day instead of it's always day one. It's always the morning of the first day.

Ray Cao (00:30:53):
I think the value, if I put it in a very reactive way is, "How can I run my second half of my marathon faster than the first half?" So that's how I think about it and how do we really continue pushing for it.

Lenny (00:31:09):
Wow, that sounds very hard and painful, but I like that metaphor. Okay, so let's talk about how you set up the product org to move as fast as you move. I think there's this idea of just running fast. I don't know if that's a phrase you use, but just how is the product org set up, especially different from other teams that you've seen that allows it to move as quickly as you move and innovate as often as you all innovate?

Ray Cao (00:31:34):
Our product teams are setting, I would say, very importantly is global. So we want to actually, like I said, the number one step is if we really want to do global business, we have to go global. So we set up teams really across the board in the global locations to really acquire global talent who knows the market and who knows the competition, too. So we're able to really getting the, let's say jumpstart, in the local market. So for example, we have the majority of the engineer and also PMs currently located in the west coast of North America, so Los Angeles and also San Jose. These are the key hubs we have for our tech folks and also for North America wise we do have our majority of the go-to-market leads sitting in New York to get closer with our seller and also with our clients at the same time.

(00:32:27):
Also, it is not necessarily only for North America. Like I said, we heavily invested in Southeast Asia, so you can see that a lot of our engineering and also PM resources are deployed over there in Singapore to enable them to get closer to our clients over there as well. So really deploy your resources globally and also focusing on the key markets you want to penetrate. That's the commitment. I think we're doing pretty good in this case. And the second one is to really, again, I think the PMs and the product team of settings are oftentimes I would say because we're growing so fast, oftentimes we have to do a lot of minor team adjustment to catering for that. So it is very usual or common for teams to do a little bit of work on an annual basis or even on a two years or three year cycle. The stability is important, don't get me wrong, but I do think that as a faster growing company, we need to consistently to reiterate not only the product but also our teams.

(00:33:33):
So how can we do reiteration on the PM side, on the go-to-market side, it is actually something that I have seen this company doing really, really well. Not necessarily we're bonding to one team structure. We're actually bonding to the market need and we're bounding to the growth we're looking for. So we're not afraid to break our seams. And actually I literally break out my team last year to make sure that my team having more go-to-market mindset to actually embedded them with seller directly. So these are the things that very, I would say conventional to a size of this company, but I do think that's necessary and also that's a good mentality for the team to really run faster with this kind of a rigid approach. So yeah, these are the two things I think very unique to us, I think could also be continuously helping us in the next phase of the growth.

(00:35:38):
I know you mentioned earlier when we were chatting offline is when you were trying to build the go-to-market org for this stuff, you failed in some ways and there's some things you learned from that experience. What went wrong when you first tried to approach this?

Ray Cao (00:35:51):
Yeah, when I joined the company, there were only two people on the go-to-market side.

Lenny (00:35:57):
For the advertising business.

Ray Cao (00:36:00):
There are only two people and by that time the US and plus, I would say, Europe business together, we're having less than 80 people, but the business needs to grow and we need to hire really fast. The first mistake I made was... By the way, the goal is to hiring 100 people in a six month to support the go-to-market. That is the speed we're into. So that is early 2020 to middle of 2020. So within six months I need to hire, I would say, 100 people to supporting the global go-to-market structure and build everything. Then the first mistake I made just at the right point because we're trying to grow too fast and sometimes as a hiring manager I have to compromise the standard we're trying to hire. So that's the mistakes I think I made first and I think nobody should repeat that mistake is you need to always run for the quality rather than the quantity. So it's a easy mistake. You can fall into the trap because the business demands you to go faster. If you don't have the manpower, you won't be able to.

(00:37:11):
But I would say, believe me when I say this, this is a pain, right, when you have the wrong people on the team, it's not necessarily going to make you move faster, it's going to actually slow you down. So that's one of the biggest mistake I made for my first year when I created the team and not necessarily myself only. So also the managers reporting to me, they're facing the same pressure and then it's cascading down. So it's definitely the mistakes we made at early stage.

(00:37:43):
The second thing I can think about is really on the context, no control. It is not necessarily I'm born into, to be honest, because I was trained really like, "Hey, this is your box, finish your work here and then you're good." But the reason why I value that really the attitude more today is literally I failed at the very early stage of my time here because I was trying to creating that kind of a very black and white discipline for my team, "You can do this, you cannot do that." But technically speaking, that's literally slowing things down because a lot of times you can see that, "Hey, we're delivering our go-to-market strategy and we're good." But literally what you don't know is your goal is not to deliver the go-to-market strategy. Your goal is to land your go-to-market strategy with sales together. So if your job only is delivering, no, you're failed oftentimes because you're not really getting the market context, you're not even talking to your clients. So that was literally another mistake I think taught me how to really embrace the culture. Here is context, no control.

(00:38:52):
And the third piece, I think, it's also a mistake, really a hard moment for me as well is, for the past couple of years now, I've been managing a such big global organization, oftentimes even not myself, my managers, they don't have time to go detail and to go talk to the clients, which is very scary because again, if you don't know, you don't hear what is happening in the market, you won't know the details in the market, you won't be able to take the right movement or take the right approach to go to market or even give the feedback to the engineering team.

(00:39:32):
So it's very important that the leader at any level needs to be situational. You cannot always down to the wheat and you cannot really distance yourself from the reality. So you need to find the balance to really get engaged and also see yourself out there to getting, I would say, getting deeper into the problems, to identify the problems, and then you're able to perform even better. Because I don't believe one thing is you are the pure, I was the people manager. You cannot do that because when you do that, you're very, very at the very, I would say, position to really thinking about your career because you're losing your competitive edge from the other, I would say equivalent talents in the market.

Lenny (00:40:18):
I love these stories. I love stories of things not working out, so I appreciate you sharing these things. When someone doesn't work out at TikTok and they have a bad time and they get let go or they leave, what's the most common reason other than just they're not good enough? Is there something that just doesn't stick with people that often leads to this is not the place for me?

Ray Cao (00:40:36):
Yeah, I would try to really thinking about this in a different way. I can tell how people can be more successful here. So I definitely can see we're just talking about people being very curious and people are very, being nimble. They can be more successful here. At the same time, I think we have to admit one thing, join a start-up and join a rocket ship is a lifestyle. It is not necessarily a job you are working on from 9 to 5. So it is a different lifestyle and it is not built for everyone. So if you are not able to adjust your mentality towards some of the work that we are here to do and it's maybe not right fit for you. I'm not saying that that candidates is incapable. I think they could be capable in the other scenario for sure, but is the right fit? I think that is, I would say very much towards the situation or the company status in the market.

(00:41:33):
I can see a lot of people that they left and become very successful, too. So it is not necessarily that, "Oh, we think you're not good and then you're going to be not good for every single other company." That's not the case.

(00:41:46):
And one thing, and also this is my team culture I try to create is, I'm happy to say that when an employee reach out to me, say, "Hey Ray, I'm actually leaving the company," as long as they're telling me that they're going to a better place or a place that they can continue to grow their career, I'm happy for them because oftentimes my last question during my interview is, "What is actually your goal in the next three to five years?" And also I'd be really honest with them, say, "Hey, I don't think this is the job for you forever. Nobody going to work in this forever. If you can, great. But what is really your North Star?" I think that's the part that I would love to co-partner with you because I always believe one thing is it is not only about achieving the company goal, it's also achieving really the career goal or your employee's career goal together.

(00:42:41):
So I want to creating that culture here as well. So yeah, I think I'm doing so far so good. Most of my team members when they actually are moving on internally or externally, I'm able to say that, "Okay, that's a good choice. If I were you, I may probably do the same thing." It is actually a very good culture, I think, I would love to champion across.

Lenny (00:43:03):
On that first point, I'm also a huge advocate of just, "You'll be successful if you work very hard." I know there's a bit of a backlash at working along and thinking too much about work-life balance. And I feel like it's actually really important to work a lot and work long hours often to be successful, especially at a company that's going through this 'cause that's not going to last forever.

Ray Cao (00:43:22):
I think at the end of the day it's a personal choice. It's very much like a personal choice. If you are excited about this, if you want to grow together, yeah, this maybe is a good thing for you. And also depends on the life stage. So some of the people they want to actually getting more family time, I think that's also the right choice, too. But it just depends on your, I would say, your personal choice rather than if the company demands that. I mean, I cannot force my team to working long hours. I don't want them to working long hours. I think it's more about if you are able to deliver, right? If it requires a bit, a longer time to contribute, I think it's okay, but you'll also get rewarded very well too. So what's get in, what's get out. So I think it's, again, I do believe that this is the quality and also the value we're evaluating here as well.

Lenny (00:44:19):
And even though it's hard in the moment, I find that those are the times you remember most and most fondly in your career, when you just go all in, "I'm going to work really hard and do the best possible job I can do." Assuming that doesn't last forever, those end up being the most impactful, helpful to your career. Most proud moments when you're just like, "Look what I had accomplished." And so I'm on the same page. I want to talk about being successful on TikTok as a creator, as a business, as an advertiser. But a couple more questions real quick on how TikTok operates. You mentioned you do OKRs just briefly, is there anything that you've learned about being successful doing OKRs within TikTok? Maybe is there anything different that you all do versus how other companies think about OKRs?

Ray Cao (00:44:59):
It is definitely a company alignment that we are using OKR as our basically the system to make sure that everybody is working towards the same goal. I think definitely we have a lot of room to improve. So how often do you actually see your team able to go to OKR at the end of a quarter and also putting OKR really two weeks or one week before the beginning of a quarter? I have to say that shame on me. I sometimes delay it a little bit, but I think the goal is always there to using OKR system as our North Star to drive the behavior and also to align. Again, it's very important to align on the OKRs because I can see a lot of times the OKRs are putting in, but they are very siloed and that is not really necessarily helpful for the company want achieving really high growth. So I think it's very important that we know we don't take OKR as a shell, but we take OKR as its core is cross-functional alignment, cross-functional goal silo. So these are the things we're still continuing improving.

Lenny (00:46:06):
Is the way that OKRs work at TikTok, is there an OKR per team and they all kind of trickle up to a company level OKR? Is it less structured that way and teams decide if they want to use OKRs or not? How does that roughly work?

Ray Cao (00:46:17):
The structure is, basically the guidance is, using the key result to evaluating and then you put the steps in between. So that's how at least my team has been using this. I think the things that we can improve is the input and output. So the output is very clear, but what is actually the input sometimes is debatable, sometimes I have to say. And also oftentimes your output is other people's input. Are you able to connect the dots over there, too? Then that's actually the part that requires a lot of, I would say reinforcement alignment. Definitely we're getting better, don't get me wrong. We're totally not perfect, for sure. But I do see there is a lot of, I say momentum, to leveraging the system better. If you know other companies doing this really, really good, please shoot them my way. I would love to learn from them.

Lenny (00:47:07):
One last question here. You do planning, you have OKRs. Just briefly, how often do you all do planning? Is there a yearly plan that you put together and then a quarterly detailed plan?

Ray Cao (00:47:16):
Yeah, we do have annual planning cycle, but I have to say that our annual planning cycle is the baseline. We often do a lot of iterations in the middle of the year and also on a quarterly basis that we're able to pivoting really nimbly to really catering to the things that we see in the market. Some of the longer term strategy won't change, just like the platform we want to always creating, inspiring and also frictionless and immersive experiences for users. This won't change, but anything into the core of how do we realizing that you're always a consistent experiment over there. I cannot speak for the user product side, but at least from advertising product side that this is always the approach we're taking. And for the go-to-market part, that's also creating a very different behavior for us because oftentimes if we have a solid and kind of a static product roadmap, you can do go-to-market relatively easy, I would say, because everything is planned. But with a environment like that that basically make the go-to-market and also the product feedback loop much more short and faster.

(00:48:23):
So there's a lot of, I would say, pressure or actually put it nicely, there was a lot of innovative things that on the go-to-market side. Also on the sales side, the company or the teams need to actually do to make sure that we're able to catering for that. But again, this is a teamwork rather than only one side of the work. So far so good, I would say. A lot of things that we've been able to achieve within the past couple of years has been already proven that this approach has been working for us, but not necessarily they're always is perfect already, always room to improve, to make sure that we have more structural approach as well so that the market able to keep the pacing with us. We don't want to overwhelm our advertisers or our users either. So that's also the other part that we need to continue optimizing, too.

Lenny (00:49:12):
Okay. Let's talk about a different topic which is being successful on TikTok. So the way I think about it in my head is, there's how to be successful is just a regular human creator person. How to be successful as a business, trying to just create viral content and then being successful as an advertiser, which I know is where you spend a lot of time. So let me just ask, is there a tip you could share for someone to be successful, say aka go viral on TikTok? I imagine your answer will be just produce something people love and want to share and like. But I guess is there anything that could be tactically useful when you're creating content in TikTok to help you go viral?

Ray Cao (00:49:47):
I think if I know that I definitely will already become a very successful creator, I have to say. Our system is very much smarter than I am. I cannot trick the system, but I have seen a couple of good cases. So number one thing is that you have to really be unfiltered. I mean, you don't really need to be perfect on this platform. I mean that's the beauty of it. You can be yourself, you can really share the things that you like. And if you're really master at one thing that you're really, really good at and you want to showcase, this is the platform for you to shine because not necessarily that we are fully saturated and also all algorithm distributing the content in a very different way. Some of the other platforms they are, I would say like a people-based or friend-based.

(00:50:32):
I think for us it's purely based on actually you're creating something that everybody want to see. So let's see if we can distribute it more. So I think continuously to bring new content to this platform and testing and finding your own competitive edge going to be very important as a successful creator. And most of our creators have been doing that. And I can see some of our biggest TikTok stars, they're literally practicing this every single day. And I do think that creativity and that part of, I would say, getting the nuances is the key part that to be more successful on the T TikTok community.

(00:51:11):
And the second thing is it's including also for brands as well, because I consider brands as our creator as well. They really need to embrace the culture and the community here to really listen and understand what are the user behaviors on the platform to understand what do they like to see. And also the messages or the presence could be very different from your other media channels, or as a creator, it could be very different from your other, I would say, platforms.

(00:51:40):
So that's the other thing that it's going to be challenging because for them to shift in the mindset. But I do think that definitely was trial. Some of the, I would say, our early adopters has already been proven that when you do embrace the culture here, you're able to acquire a ton of different kind of a user or the audience to your channel and you can show a different side of yourself as well. So yeah, I've been trying to do that. I have not really finding my competitive edge I have to say, but I'll keep trying.

Lenny (00:52:14):
Is there an example you could share of someone that has done that really well, either be really authentic and also embrace the community of a business specifically that has done this really well and has taken off not as an advertiser?

Ray Cao (00:52:25):
There was one creator I remember called Sheba. She's a singer and she is able to caught my eyes because she was able to basically rap and also during some of the songs cover in a very different way because she's a minority and she was able to basically using her minority identity as actually everybody was thinking, "I'm supposed to be doing Bollywood music, but actually, you know what I'm not. I'm doing a lot of very just hip hop and also the music that people may think like I'm not good at."

(00:52:59):
So it is pretty fun to watch that kind of a comparison or the contrast between a creator and also she's able to put a lot of original music on the platform to really inspire more people to do the same thing. There's another music, I would say TikTok creator. So he was pretty big on the other platforms, but the total approach from him is he's basically changing the lyrics, make it very relatable as a personal life. Because for example, he can totally change the lyrics from a old Backstreet Boys song or Nsync song to make it related with his daily communication with his wife. Make it really relatable and fun. So these are the things I think is very unique to us. If you are able to test and find something new like that, you're able to find a new batch of audience and even go viral on the platform.

Lenny (00:53:49):
So then switching to the advertising network, a lot of listeners here are thinking about, I imagine, advertising on TikTok. There's kind of classically been Facebook and Google are the two places to do run paid ads. Paid ads are a huge growth driver for tons of companies. It's one of the easiest you could say, or one of the most traditional way to grow. TikTok obviously is emerging and has already emerged as one of the newer advertising networks. So there's a lot of people thinking about how do I succeed as an advertiser on TikTok. So what advice do you have for people? One, who's it best for? I imagine TikTok isn't the best place to advertise for every sort of business. So what sort of businesses are best aligned to be successful on TikTok? And then just what advice can you share to do well as an advertiser on TikTok?

Ray Cao (00:54:37):
Yeah, I see a lot of really different type of advertisers already find their success on the platform. One thing that they actually can do that is really due to a couple of things that they're doing. Number one is, like I said, they're embracing this platform. They actually do a lot of things is TikTok first. I have a couple of advertisers. They have actually creating their own internal creative team just dedicated for TikTok. So they actually produce a ton of creative every single day to actually test and learn to understand the platform and understand the community they are engaging with. So I would say leaning in is the first part. It's harder, but it is not that hard. As long as you try it, you'll feel that every single day is getting easier. And also we make a lot of tools to make things easier for them as well. Like creative, we have also a lot of resources on the platform, the creative hub and also we have creative analytics to help you. So these are the things that we're able to basically help the advertiser to leaning in more.

(00:55:42):
The other angle to leaning in more is test and learn. A lot of times that people don't know how to really run ads on this platform. Google is very much search, like search fronts. They are really leading on the intent graph. And Meta is really on the people graph they're making. I mean TikTok is the content graph. It's very different, I would say machine compared to the other two. And it requires different way to optimizing and to leveraging the tools we have. So if you're applying the same logic from Meta or Google into TikTok, not necessarily you'll be able to see a great success, I have to say.

(00:56:27):
So you have to really get to the detail and to learn how you're operating this platform at the very beginning. Of course, like I said, we're trying to make things as simple as possible because we strongly believe that an advertiser's job is to taking care of their own business and our job is to service them. So we definitely make things a bit easier and along the way, but still it's a little bit learning for advertisers to change their mindset when they engage with us the first time. And I can see that again, for example, last Q4, I can see a lot of advertisers taking this approach to really listen to us and understanding what is our best practices. They actually see a very successful Q4 on the platform. So I do think that if you want to do more, just do more test and learn with us and to really understand the impact from TikTok.

Lenny (00:57:17):
Just to understand this point about versus Instagram, I think a lot of people probably run on them on both platforms and try to see which one's working better. Your point is the same content won't work as well on one versus the other. So just so people understand what the main difference there is. I know you talk about there's the friend graph versus TikTok just spreads it all over and anyone can see it. You don't have to be friends and it's really good at getting content out. So what is it that you would do differently if you're making an ad video for Instagram versus TikTok?

Ray Cao (00:57:44):
I think the TikTok video, it's more about the backend settings, right? So how often do you actually changing creatives? I think for us it is actually pretty... you want to actually test more creatives on this platform and see which one is actually working. And then we also have really detailed guidance on how do you set up your campaign structure to make sure that you're able to be more successful on the platform. So these are, I would say, the basic hydrangeas we talked about. You can see these guidance are very different from what Meta has today or even Google has today because we're just basically different platforms. And oftentimes you can also hear that we requires a bit more real time react on the platform due to some of the trends we have seen.

(00:58:30):
So that is the part I feel like if advertiser wants to engage more with really the sales team and they're able to provide more guidance to you and you're able to see more success there. But a lot of things will be counterintuitive I would say, because the intuitive you have learned is coming from the other platforms, but technically we're not. So a lot of things that, "Oh, this doesn't make sense to me, but why don't you try it?" And we make actually that really easy because we are sharing a lot of, I would say added credit to intensify incentivizing our advertisers to try it at the end of the day that hopefully they can see the result is proven itself.

# Brian Chesky’s new playbook

## Transcript

Brian Chesky (00:00:00):
Way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. They find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. That's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity. And what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Today my guest is Brian Chesky. Brian is the CEO and co-founder of Airbnb, which he started in his apartment with his co-founders, Joe and Nate, and has turned into an $80 billion global business with travelers and homes in 220 countries. I was very lucky to get to work with Brian for many years, and my sense is if you ask people who they consider the most inspiring tech or business leaders today, Brian would be right near the top of that list.

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, Brian shares an in-depth explanation of what's happening with product management at Airbnb, which caused quite a stir in the product world when he talked about this previously. We also get deep into Brian's new approach of how he runs Airbnb, including shifting away from traditional growth channels like paid growth, and instead betting that if they just build the best possible product and tell people about it, growth will happen. Also, how the product team now operates including having just one single roadmap across the entire company and Brian staying very close to every design and every feature. We also get a bit into his personal life, including how he finds balance and avoids burnout, how he continues to learn himself so that he can stay ahead of the business and its growth. This is a very special episode for me and I'm thrilled to bring you Brian Chesky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:17):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors. A trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:03:06):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

(00:05:00):
Brian, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Brian Chesky (00:05:04):
Well, thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:06):
Did you ever think when I left Airbnb, one, that I would have a podcast and two, that you would be on my podcast?

Brian Chesky (00:05:12):
I had no idea you would become a podcast host and that you would have such a successful podcast. But yeah, congrats on everything. This is awesome.

Lenny (00:05:18):
I appreciate it. Congrats to you too, Brian. Things seem to be going great. I'm excited that you're here. I want to start with the elephant in the room for a lot of listeners of this podcast. What is going on with product management at Airbnb? You made some comments at Figma Config and a lot of people got this impression that you eliminated product management at Airbnb, and I've heard from a lot of product execs having boardroom conversations as a result of that. And they were trying to decide should we remove product management from the company? Should we significantly cut product management? So I'm just curious to hear from you, what is the latest on your thinking on product management and what's happening with product management at Airbnb?

Brian Chesky (00:05:56):
I spoke at Figma four or five months ago. I spoke to a room of designers. I then got off-stage. I saw somebody tweet that said something to the nature of that I said I got rid of the product management function and all the designers in the room started cheering. So I want to talk about two things. What I actually meant, because I didn't actually get rid of the people. And also why did the people in the room cheer? Because that's also a thing we should ask ourselves. And I hope everyone listening to this podcast should understand where did that place come from, that 5,000 designers in a room cheered because they thought I eliminated the existence of a function? Because if I said I eliminated the engineering function, no one would've cheered. It was specifically that function. So I want to talk about what that might mean. It wasn't the people, it's the way they're working together.

(00:06:46):
So we don't have any longer the traditional product management function as it existed when you was here. But we didn't get rid of people helping drive the product. What we did is we combined what one might call the inbound product development responsibilities of product manager with the outbound or marketing responsibilities of product marketing. That's the first thing we did. The second thing we did is we off boarded much of the program management functions that product managers may do to actual program managers. A lot of people with the product management title are actually program managers. So we actually started off boarding some responsibilities to program management. The last thing we did is we made the group smaller and more senior. So we don't really have a lot of junior product marketers. So the most senior people are called product marketers, but everyone has to understand how to talk about the product.

(00:07:42):
So the basic idea is this. You can't build a product unless you know how to talk about the product. You can't be an expert in making the product unless you're also an expert in the market of it. And a lot of companies, what they do is they ship a product, it doesn't work, and they say, "We tried that. It didn't work." And if you say you tried and it didn't work, my question is, was it a bad product, a bad strategy or bad execution? Maybe it was a really well-made product, but you had no distribution plan. You had no way to talk about the product. If you build a great product and no one knows about it, did you even build a product? So that is essentially what we do. We have a much smaller function. The people are much more senior. They have much more responsibility. The other thing though is that they do not control or drive designing or engineering. We are a fairly purely functional model. They manage by influence. They do not have control.

(00:08:31):
Now you might ask, how does that work in a company where people can only manage by influence? Here's the amazing thing. We built and designed a company where you can manage by influence and no one has to like you. You don't actually have to win people over. Oh, and the last thing I want to say is, why did 5,000 designers cheer when the people thought I removed the product management function? Because I want to say ... I don't know if I can speak on behalf of all the designers, but having talked to a lot of designers, I think designers in the valley are very, very frustrated with the product development process. Not to say the product managers, but they're extremely frustrated.

(00:09:09):
I think a lot of designers feel like they're compromising. Many designers I know ... Heads of design. Well-known heads of design. I told them they're not designers, they're design administrators. They're running a design service organization. Because Silicon Valley often treats design as a service organization. Like design is catching things before it goes out the door. It's not actually typically part of the development process. And I think this is not just bad for design, it's bad for product managers and engineers because we all want to build the best products. And one day you wake up and a variety of phenomenon might have happened. And if people are watching this from a large company, here might be some of the characteristics.

(00:09:43):
The first thing you notice is that these different groups might be running on slightly different technical stacks. That's the first problem. And they may actually be accumulating technical debt. The next problem you'll see is that there's a lot of dependencies. So five teams are going different directions, but they all need a payment platform. And so what happens is that the teams that everyone's dependent on get this backup like a deli and people are going around the block. And then at some point they just give up. So then the teams that are dependent on other people say, "Give me the resources and I'll build this group myself." So instead of five teams going to marketing to get a campaign or to leverage some service, they start building their own marketing departments, their own groups. So now they're really becoming separate divisions. And this is where a division comes from.

(00:10:34):
Now, once you have a division, your division is as successful as you are a priority. So now you have to advocate for your division. So there's a lot of advocacy. If you have dependencies, you've got to persuade people by building relationships. And so the people that are liked that build the best relationships are the ones that get the most resources and that creates what we call politics. And so now politics that brood in the company. And suddenly people gets more subdivided, more subdivided, subdivided. And that creates another problem, which we call bureaucracy. And that bureaucracy means it's hard to know who's doing what. People are going in different directions and that creates a lack of accountability. When there's lack of accountability, then there's a sense that what I do doesn't matter and that creates complacency. And then suddenly a fast-growing company becomes a big slow moving bureaucracy. This is a general arc that winds up happening.

(00:11:30):
And then you end up having this situation where a company's done 10 marketing efforts, but no customer's heard anything. They have thousands of engineers, they shipped all these products, but a customer can't tell you a single thing you did. Marketing and engineering don't talk to each other. It's not even they hate each other, they're in different universes. I've always said that the health of an organization, one simple heuristic is how close is engineering and marketing? And marketing is at lot of companies are like the waiters, engineers are like the chefs and the chefs yell at the waiters and they go in the kitchen. In fact, the waiters are the ones talking to the customers all day and they also know how to sell things so you really want them being enjoined at the hip and you want engineers to be thinking about maybe how to talk about the products that they're building.

(00:12:17):
So this is the problem that we had. And also the other thing we were doing is, as you know Lenny, we were spending a lot of money in performance marketing. I don't think performance marketing is a bad thing. I think of performance marketing as a laser. Actually my co-founder who obviously you know well, Joe, used to have this metaphor of lasers, flash bulbs and chandeliers. If you want to light up a room, performance marking is a laser. It can light up a corner of a room. You don't want to use a bunch of lasers to light up an entire room. You should use a chandelier and that's what brand marketing is. But if you do need to laser in and balance supply and demand, then performance marketing is really good. It literally lasers in. Performance marketing though doesn't create very good accumulating advantages because it's not an investment. Now if you want to build it permanently, like booking.com, if you have a really high ROI, now you can have a performance marketing arbitrage business. But assuming you don't want an arbitrage business, you actually need to be investing. And so we think of marketing as education. That we're educating people on the unique benefits.

(00:13:23):
So a lot of companies don't do product marketing. They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy. Product strategy roadmap that gets updated every six months with releases. We release products every May and every November or October. Obviously we did one today we can talk about.

(00:14:26):
The entire company works together. They row in the same direction. And the product management also does the product marketing. So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there.

Lenny (00:15:24):
That was amazing. You touched on all of the things I want to talk about. So I'm going to-

Brian Chesky (00:15:27):
Oh, gee. So we can go deeper and deeper because the rabbit hole goes deep.

Lenny (00:15:31):
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So I'm going to pull on a couple threads. The first is this idea of a single roadmap you talked about. And what this reminds me of is I was talking to another very prominent CEO of a public company and he pointed out that there's this cycle that he sees a lot of founders go through where they initially run the show, they're in charge, they tell people what to build, and then over time they're encouraged to delegate and to empower and it leads to a bunch of optimization work and small thinking maybe. And you talked about bureaucracy and politics. And then eventually you realize I need to take the reins again and drive the ship and take back control of what's happening. And it feels like you went on that journey.

Brian Chesky (00:16:08):
That's exactly how it went, and that's how it goes almost at every company I've heard of. By the way, I think that many years ago, I remember I think reading a blog post by Ben Horowitz saying that a lot of people tell product led founders or engineering led founders to step away and delegate their product to other people, but suddenly they've delegated away the thing they're best at. The thing that is hardest for them to replace. So we don't have a chief product officer title, but if we had one, it would be me. I wouldn't have a chief product officer. I think the CEO should be basically the chief product officer of a product or tech company. If the CEO is not the chief product officer then I don't know if they're a product or tech led company. Maybe that's okay if they're an ops company or if they're a marketing company or if they're not a tech company at all. But ultimately I think the founder or CEO should be that person.

(00:16:59):
So when we were starting Airbnb, it was probably the three of us. As you know, I think Airbnb was a unique situation where it was three of us. I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did ops, I did a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything but engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product.

(00:17:27):
And I always remember Lenny there was this paradox where the less involved I was in a project ... Let me be clear. There were times I inserted myself and dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And that was just a learning experience for me. But there was this other scenario where the less involved I was in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved. And the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Because people assume that our natural equilibrium's to move fast so if we're moving slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership and therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for initially, they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always, it seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster so I'd empower them and move slower.

(00:18:26):
And again, how that happened is what I described. That you end up in a situation where you're delegating down. So I think that things were getting worse and slower and slower and slower. 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. And by 2019 we were spending a billion dollars on AdWords. We weren't really investing in the brand. We were doing a huge amount of AB testing. I think AB testing is important in times. Actually, let me clarify AB testing. We don't test blue versus green. We have a control and a treatment like I think we did when you were here. So we have a design. We might do a holdback occasionally to see how the thing is working. But if we do an AB test, there has to be a hypothesis. If we don't have a hypothesis and A is better than B, then we're stuck with B. And that's a really, really big problem, but we can never change it.

(00:19:27):
And then imagine 10 teams doing AB testing. Imagine if you designed software the way you designed a house or design a house the way design software. And we AB test a sofa. And we said, well, how does this sofa work? And it seems like with this sofa that we've AB tested people spend more time in the living room, so therefore people are going to like this room better. But actually the sofa has a relationship to the end stands which have a relationship to the lamps which have a relationship to the carpet or the rug which have a relationship to the television which have a relationship to the house and everything else. So you have to think about the whole cohesive system. And I started realizing that. I asked one person on your team, somebody you know well, and I asked him, I said, "I feel like I open our app and the product hasn't changed and four years." I remember saying this, 2018, 2019. And this person described that you know well as just the way we were doing things. The initial way we were doing things to move fast had made us move slow.

(00:20:29):
So what we ended up doing is ... It was now late 2019. I don't know what to do. I'm like, the product is slow, the app seems to not change, costs are rising. I keep adding more people. There seems to be more politics. By politics I mean advocating for individual interests rather than the whole company. More bureaucracy meaning meetings about meetings about meetings and a lot of dependencies. People were describing working 80 hours and getting 20 hours of productive work done, which is just a crazy ratio a week. And I didn't really quite know what to do.

(00:21:03):
And then right before the pandemic, I meet two people that really affected how I thought about things. The first was Hiroki Asai. Hiroki now works at Airbnb. He's one of my executives and actually product design, product marketing design and marketing report into him. And he was a creative director for Apple. So he worked for Steve Jobs, was basically dotted line to Steve for many, many years. Came from graphic design. Eventually ran all of marketing communications. In Apple Marketing Communications, they actually designed the app. They made the app. They designed all the marketing touchpoints for the store. So it wasn't just ads, it was every brand touchpoint they were responsible. So everything flowed through marketing. And so marketing became the governing factor that made everything really organized.

(00:21:52):
I met another person or got reacquainted a person named Jony Ive. And Jony Ive was the head of industrial design and Chief Design Officer at Apple. And they described this way of running a company that was totally different than the way that I was running it. It was basically the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple from about 1998 until he died in 2011. Apple somewhat runs it this way today, but the services is turning into a division and they are just so big that I think it's not a one-to-one anymore, but they are still technically run this way. And I had this image of not being divisional because we were running ... We had 10 divisions. We had a flights division and we had a homes division which was divided to pro hosts and core hosts and lux and we had business travel and we had a magazine and we had experiences and we had .org and we had China. So we had these 10 different divisions all going in 10 different directions. And I created this culture where everyone would be a business manager or business leader, general manager, which made them want to create many general managers. And so the company kept getting subdivided, subdivided, subdivided and that made it very, very difficult to turn.

(00:22:57):
And this was all about me delegating responsibility. The problem is if you're running a divisional company, you're a product-led founder ... What are you doing? Strategy, capital allocation. My job went from proactive to very reactive. I was reacting to a lot of things. I was in a lot of meetings. Trying to adjudicate different issues between groups. So then the pandemic occurs and I had this image on mind. It's like I have this dream that I could run a company much more like a startup. I remember going on a walk with Joe and Nate in Bolinas. It was October 2019. And I told them I had this dream that I left the company 10 years ago and they just asked me to come back. And I said, "I was horrified at what I found." And they said, "Well, what'd you find?" I said, "I found a company that on the one hand had amazing culture and people with a great mission, with a brand people really loved, but we lost our design roots. We weren't investing in the longterm. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and cost was rising and growth was slowing." And that was exactly what was happening.

(00:24:20):
And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God. I remember basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near-death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your life flashes before your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near-death business experience and our business flashed before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back involved in the details. And by the way, Lenny, here's the funny thing. Before the crisis, a lot of people felt like I was too involved in different areas. Once the crisis happened, guess what happened? People were like, what do we do? We need you more involved. And so I got more involved.

(00:25:05):
And when I got involved, I made the following changes. The first thing I did is I said, everything we're doing has to be written down and put into a Google sheet. It turns out people couldn't even write down everything they were doing. I remember one person told me, "We're doing too many things for me to ever be able to document." I'm like, "What?" But anyways, we eventually got everyone to write everything down. And I said, okay, we can do about 20% of these things. And so if everyone says, "Oh, Airbnb is simple. I'm only doing three things." Yes, but you're one of a thousand people. So actually we're doing 3000 things. So instead of one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of the team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup.

(00:25:54):
So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product which turned to product marketing and marketing and communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. As a relative comparison, I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big, it's just say that's how small we are and we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees.

(00:26:28):
So we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist. Or there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leader's job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Jony did. They're interchangeable. I could never imagine Jony out at Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work? How do you give them development if you're not in the details with them on the work? So the same thing is true. So people had to be experts. Everyone had to be an expert.

(00:27:11):
I stopped pushing decision-making down. I pulled it in. I created one shared consciousness and I said, the top 30, 40 people in the company are going to have one continuous conversation. Metrics are going to be subordinate to the calendar. So we're going to have a roadmap. It's going to be a two-year roadmap. We'll update the roadmap literally every month. People may wonder, well, what if the world changes? Yeah, it changes every day. So the roadmap's something where the next month doesn't change, but two years out it changes. It's a rolling roadmap. And by the way, if Ukraine gets invaded and you want to provide housing for refugees, you can still pivot people and adapt very quickly. We house 120,000 refugees. So you still keep a reserve of resources to be able to pivot and do things because there's always unexpected events.

(00:27:54):
I created this new function called product marketing. We basically described what that is. I made the group much smaller. I took a lot of product managers, I reassigned them as program managers. I had many of them trained in actual program management because their roles got much bigger. Program management at Airbnb is a high status job. A lot of companies, it's like a coordination job. At Airbnb we said because we're going to do launches, it's high status. We said we're going to do two launches a year and you can't ship something unless it's on the roadmap. So every single thing in the company, with the exception of some infrastructure projects have to be on the roadmap. And then I'm going to review all the work. And so we create the CEO review schedule where I said I'm getting back involved in the project and I'm going to review all the product and all the marketing. So every project I would review every week, every two weeks, every four weeks, every eight weeks or every 12 weeks. There'd be a cadence.

(00:28:46):
And then I had a head program manager that would score all the projects. Either they're green, yellow, or red. Meaning they're on track or not on track to ship. Whether we thought they were work, we don't know until after we ship it. But I use the reviews of the work every single week. And the reason there's not a lot of bureaucracy and the reason you don't need any influence at Airbnb is I'd review the work and if something wasn't happening, then I would stop the meeting and say, "Why isn't this happening?" And we would all get together. And so you couldn't have a situation where a team wouldn't collaborate. It would be like I could then feel the work of an individual engineer.

(00:29:25):
Because imagine if we're a car company and I see the car prototype every week and I notice there's something about the tires off. Now I can identify the individual person who was blocked. So every week I would try to see the equivalent of at least a semi assembly of the entire new product we were working on, which allowed me to identify with teams the different bottlenecks happening in the company. The reviews were the thing that allowed us to dictate the pace. And so because we had all these reviews, I didn't need to mandate people going back to an office. I didn't really care where they worked because I could track how well they were working because of the review cycle. So these were some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in-house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use Wieden+Kennedy or ChiatDay or any of those anymore. We actually built our own in-house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group.

(00:30:32):
The creative group does not just the ads but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing, and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, why don't we just have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now, there may be people that come from a different background, like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing. And writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing. Unless you want your head of writing to report to design, then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes.

(00:31:16):
Just to round up the question that you asked, I think that way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for, not just the person who's there because they might not always be there.

(00:32:17):
I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement, and I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leader's job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? And so I made sure I was in the details and we really drove the product.

(00:34:15):
You guys found such a unique way of working. I've never heard of a company working in these ways, in so many contrarian ways. I think it's going to be a really interesting case study as things progress. Essentially what you've done is shut down traditional growth channels or at least limited them. Paid growth and maybe SEO, maybe referrals at least for a while. And you've shifted to let's just make an awesome product and tell people about it. And our bet is that's going to grow. Do you feel like this can work for most other products or is there a consumer specific opportunity? What advice would you give to founders that are thinking about, man, we should try something like this?

Brian Chesky (00:34:53):
I think that this methodology can work for everyone, but I don't think you have to be as ideological or have to go all the way to 100. I still think growth channels matter. To be clear, we still spend money on performance marketing. We still do measure conversion and we will do some experiments. Think of conversion and growth optimization as like running a football down a field and think of these big leaps as passes. You should probably be doing 80% passes, 20% running the ball down the field, and a lot of companies that do 80% running down the ball down the field and 20% passes. So I think that this methodology will work for everyone.

(00:35:33):
Here are the things I believe. I'll give you a checklist. Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as this chief product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Lenny. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they really are running separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people managers in the entire company. And when I say people managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain. Because you can't manage people devoid of their work.

(00:36:18):
Imagine a fire chief and they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want hold the product back. I think that teams should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Eames that said you can't delegate understanding. If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. Intuition comes not from arbitrariness, it comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design ideally report to the founder, product led person. I would not have design under product unless you have an extremely good reason or the product person is a designer.

(00:37:25):
I would try to think about product management, expanding the responsibility and including distribution. Understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing.

(00:38:18):
I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of a TV series. And you should think of your company in a five or 10 years story. You may not know where you are in 10 years, but you're telling this ongoing story. And most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, actually I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company?

Lenny (00:38:48):
Speaking of rowing in the same direction, you had a huge launch today. I know you wanted to talk about it. Your winter release. And it is the culmination of a lot of the things you're talking about. I'd love to hear just some of the stuff you're launching.

Brian Chesky (00:39:00):
Let me just back up Lenny. You know this problem really well. One of the best things of Airbnb is that we're this marketplace where guests and hosts come together and we have all this unique inventory and people list it on Airbnb. And every home is one of a kind and we have seven million homes and there's all this surprise and all this delight. The problem is that every home is one of a kind and you often don't know what you're going to get. And so a lot of guests have described checking into Airbnb as a moment of truth. Where when you open the door you find out if the home is exactly the home that you booked. And this turns out to be a big problem for people wanting to book an Airbnb. And when we survey guests or people who don't use Airbnb, the number one ... Hotels are not as special, they're not as unique, but the advantage they have is you know what you're going to get. You know exactly what you're going to get.

(00:39:56):
And so what we found is that reliability is Airbnb's achilles heel, or at least it has been. That with hotels you know what you're going to get an Airbnb you don't always know what you're going to get. And so we asked ourselves, what if we could combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with the reliability that you've come to expect in a hotel? And that's what we've done with Guest Favorites. Guest Favorites are homes that guests in our community love the most. We took 370 million reviews on Airbnb plus millions of customer service tickets, plus all the host cancellation data and we use all the signal to create the top two million homes. This collection of two million homes that we call Guest Favorites because the guests rate the highest. We think combine the uniqueness of Airbnb with a reliability you've come to expect in a hotel and I can't imagine there's a lot of use cases where you wouldn't want to book a Guest Favorite.

(00:40:50):
We think that's also part of this broader system of ratings and reviews. You see, as you know, Airbnb is built on a system of trust and we invented this new way for people to trust one another, at least at scale through living together certainly. And we felt like the rating and review system could use a little bit of an upgrade. So we obviously made some upgrades to ratings and reviews. The final thing, and this brings up another point I might bring up, is we've completely overhauled the host tab. One of the most important things when you get to an Airbnb is the listing is accurate. But the problem is that a lot of host listings don't have all the details up to date. So they might not describe perfectly their listing, they might not have filled up their amenities, they might not have a photo tour. And the reason why as we're doing research is because they found it was hard to manage their listing. And it was hard to manage their listing because it was designed as this hodgepodge thing by different teams over many years.

(00:41:47):
Oh, here's the other thing, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we had a guest team and a host team. We don't have a guest team and host team. We have a design team. We have a marketing team. We have an engineering team. The reason we don't break the app into guests and hosts anymore is because reviews affect guests and hosts. It turns out that almost everything involves connecting the guest and host. When you have separate teams, they tend to have separate roadmaps that go in separate directions that become incompatible. So we have product marketers that are responsible for guests and host things, but the designers and the engineers are fairly fungible and they can move from project to project.

(00:42:25):
And then we keep some people, especially the product marketing people on a domain area, but we really want to make sure that we have designers and engineers covering a much larger surface. And so that's what we did. We have this incredible new tab called the listing tab that we designed. It's quite possibly one of the nicest things we ever designed. If you go to my Twitter account, you'll see a little sizzle reel from some of the design we've done. By the way, the design is a whole new aesthetic. I'd like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending. I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism. The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design. And I think we're going to move back into a world with color, texture, dimensionality, more haptic feedback, but I don't think it's going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather, but I think it's going to have a sense of dimension.

(00:43:24):
I think the reason why is we're spending more and more time on screens and we want the screens to replicate some of what we see in the natural environment. Light, texture. I think it's more intuitive, it's more playful. I think AI allows the development of more sophisticated interfaces. People in AI are gravitating to image generating art that has got more dimension to it. And so I think that we've really started to push this more three-dimensional, colorful aesthetic that I think it's going to be where a lot of interface design is going. And we built this AI powered photo tour where we created our own AI computer visioning language that we trained on 100 million photos and it can basically scan all your photos and organize them by room. So that's what we did today. Maybe just to round it up, what I would say is that none of this would've been possible in the old way of working. We could have theoretically launched a lot of these features, but really getting them to work together has been key. And Guest Favorites has required the guests, people ... You have to work with guests, you have to work with hosts, you have to essentially ... You have to figure out how to communicate to the market. So it's a much more integrated approach.

Lenny (00:44:41):
The designs you talked about, they are incredibly cute. You tweeted a little video of a lot of them, like the couch with little textures on it. It is really cool. Also, the listing tab. I think people that aren't hosts don't understand how important the listing experience is to a host. How many hosts are there? Seven million? Something like that?

Brian Chesky (00:45:00):
There's seven million listings. Over seven million listings.

Lenny (00:45:04):
Yeah. And so that's the home base. That's like the small business platform for millions of people. And so I worked on the host sites. I have a special place in my heart for host features, and I feel like travelers don't really appreciate the value of that part of the product.

Brian Chesky (00:45:18):
Well, yeah, you did some amazing work there. Yeah. The big lesson, Lenny, the other thing we learned is to create a great guest experience, you need great hosts, and to have great hosts, they need great tools. And so if you want to create a great experience for guests, it often starts with building great tools for hosts to enable them to provide a great experience for guests. And so that was one of the theories behind the listing tab is we're going to build great tools for hosts. They're going to love it. And we also felt like if we put care in the design of our app, that hosts are going to see that and that they're going to actually put care into hosting. Even more than they already do. And they do put a lot of care in now.

Lenny (00:45:55):
Speaking of great products, a defining characteristic of Brian Chesky in my mind is how big you make people think. How you push people to think bigger. Memories I have of you is in meetings, we present our goal and you're always saying, "How do we 10X this? What would it take to 10X this idea?" And somehow we often hit these crazy goals after you 10X'd them or sometimes just double them. What have you learned about just the power of setting really ambitious goals, but also finding the balance with not demoralizing people if they don't hit these really ambitious goals?

Brian Chesky (00:46:32):
As you know, there was a saying inside of Airbnb, it was add a zero. Add a zero at the end, which is to imagine something you order, imagine it bigger. The exercise isn't necessarily to say if people say they want to hit a goal, I say, okay, I added a zero, you have to hit that goal. It's more the exercise of what would it take to be 10X bigger or do something 10 times better? Because what you find is when you push people, they will sometimes think about the problem differently. And one of the best ways to get unstuck from a problem is to imagine a 10X scale or 10X better or 10X faster where you can't do the current process to do it. You have to think differently about the problem. And to think differently about the problem means you have to deeply understand the problem. And to deeply understand the problem, you have to break it into its components.

(00:47:22):
And we might call this first principle thinking. What are the foundational elements that comprise this problem and how can we reconstruct them? So the first thing is I think by adding a zero, at least conceptually for teams, that helps them understand a problem. The second is, I think one of the most important things for a founder or leader to do is set the pace of the team. I think the pace of the team is one of the most important things you can do. And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say, "Okay, let's circle back on this next week." No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting until it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay, what are you doing? Okay, let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay, how do we do this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time.

(00:48:18):
But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero, Lenny, is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think, in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once ... I'm going to paraphrase what he said. What is your secret to success? And he said, "That I just asked my players to do their very best." And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential in people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves.

(00:49:04):
When I tell somebody it's not good enough, either I'm saying, you're not good enough, or I believe that you have more potential than you're showing me. So in other words, you can push a team and they could feel demoralized because they can feel like what they're doing is not good enough if they have a fixed mindset or you create a growth mindset organization where the more I'm involved, the more I say you can do better, it's because the more I believe in you, and I know that you have more in you. And the way to know if a team could do better is if they're life dependent on it, could they do it? And Andy Grove used to say that there's competency and motivation. And motivation is if they're life ... Not literally dependent on it, but if it was a crisis or if it was a defining moment in their lives. I think the job of a leader is not to make it life and death, that's too far, but to be able to motivate a team to see potential in them that they don't see in themselves, and to really push them. To set a tempo, to break something down to first principle thinking. And if you do that, then I think that's going to be the opposite of these slow moving, soul crushing bureaucracies.

Lenny (00:50:06):
I've definitely been through that where you set a crazy goal and then we ended up hitting it. And so I've seen that myself. With some of the things you've talked about of say, do it now, we're not going to wait another week to circle back and this stuff you talked about of taking on the CPO role, not having a CPO, and also all these launches, it sounds like a lot of work and a lot of hours. What have you learned about avoiding burnout and creating balance and also just helping people on your team avoid burnout and creating balance?

Brian Chesky (00:50:34):
First of all, I want to give you a very surprising learning. I weirdly now, the more I get involved ... This is so weird. The more in the details I am, the more time I have on my hands. That's a paradox. And I want to explain that paradox. It doesn't make any sense. But when I explain this process to people that I would be in the details, we'd have one shared consciousness, I would review everything, we would do endless edits of even the press release, it would seem like I would be working 80, 100 hours a week and that people will be disempowered and that no one would want to do anything. And I got just the opposite. Here's what I found. If you decide to be in the details and get very, very hands-on like I did, it might be a lot more work for about one to two years.

(00:51:20):
And so for one to two years it was way more work than the old way. But once we turned the corner, suddenly everyone started rowing the same direction. Suddenly I didn't have to be in meetings anymore and people would do what I wanted them to do if I wasn't there. And by the way, that's what the culture is. They say the culture is what happens when you're not in the room and the brand is what people say when you're not in the room. And so that became our culture. Suddenly there was fewer conflicts in the company. There was less turnover. People were rowing in the same direction. That I wasn't reacting. Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction and by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction, but I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times as work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time on my hands initially, and now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands.

(00:52:33):
But to answer your question on burnout, I think is another very good question. I do not think I am the poster child, at least historically, of work-life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you asked me when I was in college how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would've thought the inverse. That I'd have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you need ... Let's say an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives, slower and slower.

(00:53:13):
And so I basically have tried to make it a practice to step away from the work. And so here's some of the things I do. Every other weekend I don't really work at all. And then every other weekend I work pretty intensely. If I had a family, it would probably be more like a day of the weekend I'd work more intensely. You wouldn't be a parent every other weekend, but I'm not so it's a little different. I usually make sure I exercise and I never miss a workout. So I usually wake up, I'll do 20 minutes of morning cardio on a Peloton. I'll go to the gym three or four times a week and do weights. I'll basically do cardio just about every day. I make sure that I eat really healthy. I have a classic bodybuilding diet of five to six meals a day. So I try to make sure I do that. I try to make sure I get a fairly good amount of sleep.

(00:54:01):
The other two things I try to do is have really healthy relationships. I think one of the most important things that will govern how happy you are in your life is your relationships. I think the three things are your health, your relationships, and your work. Those are probably the three most important things. So as long as you're healthy and you have meaningful work, the last is relationships. And there was this Harvard study. It's the longest study on human happiness. I think it's 85 years old. And the question was, what's the secret of happiness? And of course they weren't expecting to have a single answer, but they got one. And the answer was, the secret to happiness, if there is one, is healthy relationships. And I had found, Lenny, that over the time of being an entrepreneur, I had gotten totally isolated. It was almost as if I didn't have friends. I had friends, but I didn't keep in touch with them. And every time I reached out to a friend, I had to get them up to speed on my life. And if you have to get people up to speed, you're not really keeping as much in touch with them. And so I started making a practice a couple of years ago to make sure that I have a group of friends that I'm constantly in touch with, including old friends.

(00:55:03):
So I have a group of high school friends, we have a group chat and we take one to two trips together a year. I have a group of college friends, we have a group chat. We take probably a couple trips together a year. By the way, doing Airbnbs are great. We all get in a house together and it's like your opportunity to have a shared experience. And if you don't travel with your old friends, you'll have only old stories to talk about and then you say the same old stories over and over. So you want to be able to have new shared experiences. When I stay here in New York City ... I'm in New York right now. That's why you don't see my typical background. I stay in my sister's apartment. So she's got a two bedroom and I stay in her house because I like to see her. And I just make sure I spend a lot of time with friends. And of course we travel. Traveling is what I do with a lot of my friends. And then I like to draw and read. So I try to make sure it's health, work and relationships. And I try to make sure I have a balance of each. And you might call family relationships. I'm single, but that would be another version of it.

Lenny (00:56:02):
I heard you say along the same lines on a different podcast about how when you're really busy, you didn't have time to reach out to anyone and they never thought they could reach out to you because they thought you were so busy.

Brian Chesky (00:56:12):
In the old world, I was reacting, so everyone thought I was busy. So the people I really cared about, a lot of them said, "Well, he's busy so he'll reach out to me when he's not busy." But here's a problem. I was so busy that all I was doing all day was responding to people. And so if people I cared about didn't reach out to me, I was dealing with incoming. I could barely deal with the incoming. Now that was a mistake. But I was reacting. By the way, here's another lesson for founders. A lot of founders spend their time based on reacting. So people will email them and they'll wake up and they'll respond to emails, and suddenly their email sets the agenda. People ask for meetings, and suddenly the meetings they take are based on the people who email them. Versus here's my strategy and then over the next year, what are the relationships I need to have and the meetings I need to take to be able to execute this strategy?

(00:57:05):
If my life were to end in a year or in 10 years or some time horizon that's shorter than I expected, who are the people I would've wanted to make sure I spent time with? And if you imagine that your life is finite, because it is, and you imagine you're not going to be here as long as you thought you would be, because it's possible, it would completely change how you prioritize your time. I think suddenly you would start to say no to things and you'd say yes to other things. I now try to say no to what I call fake work, which is things that feel like work, but they don't actually move the ball down the field. And I really try to say yes to the work that's very meaningful and people that are very meaningful to me. So yeah, it's a really, really good insight. And by the way, that metaphor, Lenny, but it's true of companies too. You can sometimes be ... You don't want to only spend your time reacting or spending your time with the employees reaching out to you. You do want to do some of it, but then you're rewarding only one type of behavior and the introverts or the people that aren't reaching out to you aren't going to get any attention.

Lenny (00:58:14):
Just one more question and then I have a quick fun question at the end. I know you have to run. If I were to ask people who are the most inspiring leaders in tech and in business in general, I think you'd be right near the top of that list. You've been through a lot of ups and downs, you've learned a lot of lessons along the way. What have you found has been most helpful to helping you continue to grow and keep up with the business, the way the business has grown, the scale and just to take on this leadership role? Is it coaching? Is it reading? Is it other mentors? Something along those lines.

Brian Chesky (00:58:46):
You ask really good questions. And by the way, thank you. I'll share a few thoughts. I was with Sam Altman probably a few weeks ago at dinner, and I told him, "I still feel like I have a lot to prove. I haven't made it yet." And he was really surprised. He's like, "What are you talking about?" And I didn't even realize that he thought that was an absurd notion, but I said, no, I haven't made it yet. It's not to say I'm not grateful or I feel like I need to get somewhere so that therefore I'll feel worthy. But I have this beginner's mindset that the bigger I get, the more a beginner I tend to feel. It's a weird feeling. I think when I first took off, I think I thought I knew everything or I knew more than I certainly did. But then you get past some peak or you go into this trough where you realize, oh my God, the moment you get to some frontier of knowledge, you start to become a beginner again and everything is new.

(00:59:49):
And so I think the first thing I try to do is to be a beginner. Pablo Picasso had a saying. He said, "It took me four years to learn to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to learn to paint like a child." And so I've tried to always see the world through the eyes of a child. And I think one of the key characteristics of a child is curiosity. To see everything with fresh eyes. To not have too many judgments. When I was trying to figure how to run the company, I studied the history of divisional organizations and I studied Steve Jobs, but also studied what Bill Gates did. And I studied Alfred Sloan at General Motors that MIT Sloan is named after. And actually the founding of divisional companies, which I believe was DuPont. They were making powder for gunpowder. The war ends. What do we do with powder? Turns out powder can be used for paint, but the way you sell gunpowder and paint are different sales channels so they created what we now know as the divisional structure.

(01:00:46):
So I try to understand the sources of things. I try to learn. I try to be shameless about reaching out to help. I think that a lot of people are afraid to reach out to help because they think other people are busy. The biggest honor most people get in their lives, or one of the biggest honor is when other people ask them for help. Because we all just want to feel useful. So don't feel ashamed to reach out to something for help. It gives a lot of them great honor. And I think you don't need to reach out to people 10 years ahead of you. They can just be people a year ahead of you. In fact, an entrepreneur getting started, I might be less youthful than somebody two years ahead of them that knows the latest distribution channels that I have forgotten. So I think that that is the key. It's learning, it's growing, it's curiosity. It's constantly having that hunger and that fire to always want to be better. To feel like I haven't made it yet. Because the reason I say I haven't made it yet is because if I've made it, then I'm done. And I want to feel like an artist. Bob Dylan used to say, "An artist has to be in a constant place of becoming and so long as they don't become something, then they're going to be okay."

(01:02:05):
And so you have to always be evolving, learning, growing, and the canvas keeps getting bigger. The mountaintop keeps getting higher. And I feel like I'm just getting started and I hope that ... I don't know how long you intend to do the podcast, but I intend to do this for a long time and if you do or whatever, we'll definitely want to have talks. And I hope years from now, Lenny, I hope 70% of what I said I still believe, but if 100% of what I say, I still believe then I probably haven't learned very much. And so if 90% I say I don't believe anymore than I'm delusional and wrong. But I sincerely hope that I retract it or change or modify a few things I said today in a few years, because that will mean that I've gained more wisdom. And so how do I do that? By being curious.

Lenny (01:02:59):
That is beautiful. It reminds me, you mentioned Sam Altman. There's a tweet that he put out a couple of weeks ago that I'll read real quick. "Many people have reached out to offer help and advice over the past year. No one has gotten close to Brian Chesky in terms of delivering. He will take a midnight call at any time, put in hours of work on any topic, answer difficult questions correctly with clarity, make any intro, et cetera." How does that feel to have seen that?

Brian Chesky (01:03:23):
I had no idea he was going to do that. And I just want to say I think Sam is obviously a once in a generation founder. I think what he's done with OpenAI is extraordinary. And when he launched ChatGPT I had known him for a real long period of time, and I knew a sense of the journey he was about to go on. And I think that he was very deep into the technical part and then research part of OpenAI. But it turned out there was a product, a design, a marketing, a leadership, a sales. So there were all these other functional responsibilities. And so being able to just play a small part in giving some advice when necessary ... And he would take what he wanted and discard others. But I think, Lenny, maybe this goes to another thing, which is all I tried to do with Sam was what other people did for me.

(01:04:13):
Before Y Combinator, there was a person named Michael Seibel. He's in Y Combinator. And he used to meet with me and give me advice. And he wasn't an official advisor, he wasn't an investor. I didn't hire him or anything like that. He wasn't on my board. And I asked him, I said, "How do I repay you?" And he said, "Well, I want you to pass this on to other founders." And I would meet with a lot of people in the valley, and there was just this incredible culture of generosity that we all were going to win if the ecosystem was healthy. And the ecosystem would be healthy if we all helped one another. And you pay it forward. I think that it's just one continuation of the valley of people helping one another, learning from one another. And I also feel like I learned by teaching as well.

Lenny (01:05:03):
Final question. When someone joins Airbnb, there's a very longstanding tradition of sharing a fun fact about yourself. It might be the longest standing tradition. It's always tough on the spot, but I'm curious, Brian, if there's a fun fact that you want to share about yourself that maybe people don't already know.

Brian Chesky (01:05:18):
Yeah. A fun fact about me is that I actually spent most of my life as an artist. When I was five years old I remember my parents take me to the Norman Rockwell museum and I would sit in front of his beautiful illustrations. They're really paintings I should say. I shouldn't even call them illustrations. And I would try to reproduce them. And I got obsessive with art. I remember when I was maybe in elementary school, I asked Santa for poorly designed Christmas toys so I could redesign them. When I got older, one of my friends, I went to his house ... I'm going to say I was eight or nine years old. And his dad was basically redoing his deck, but his dad decided to design it himself. I think maybe he was an architect. So he had this giant dining room table, and he had this vellum paper and he had a T-square and a drawing triangle and a protractor. They were really cool looking tools, and they were basically floor plans and architectural drawings.

(01:06:15):
So I got into architectural and landscape design when I was like eight or nine, and that led to my interest in architecture. I went to RPI when I was in freshman year of high school to do a pre-college program. Then I got into more and more drawing and figure drawing. Then I got into a film and animation. Then I got involved in environmental design. I realized that if you buy stock in a company, you could get these cool glossy annual reports. This is when the internet was nascent and people still mailed the annual reports. As so I got my dad to buy a few shares at some Disney stock. And I got these renderings and he had a report of theme parks. And I started drawing and designing theme parks in communities.

(01:07:00):
And I was at this private school actually for hockey. Because I had this life where I was playing ice hockey and I thought I was going to play college hockey. My dad was really into it. I was really into it. And I had an art teacher in high school at this military school. That's another fun fact. I basically went to a military high school.

Lenny (01:07:21):
Wow. I did not know that.

Brian Chesky (01:07:22):
And at this military sports academy oriented high school, I had the same art teacher from eighth grade to 11th grade. And that's not a good thing, by the way. I don't say it as a good thing because I was not diversifying my skills. And so I leave this high school because I wanted to pursue different interests than hockey. And I transferred to my public high school late my junior year. And imagine transferring to a new public high school late junior year. And I meet my art teacher who changes my life. Her name is Ms. Williams, and she sees my artwork. And by the way, my mom was nervous about me becoming an artist. She used to tell me, "I chose a job for the love, and I got paid no money. So you should choose a job that pays you a lot of money." And I said to my mom, "One day, I'm going to be an artist." She said, "Oh my God, you chose the only job where you're going to paid less than a social worker." So I think my parents, they were supportive of me going to art, but they were very nervous. And then Ms. Williams told my mom, she said, "Don't worry. He's going to be a famous artist one day." I wasn't going to become a famous artist. But what that did is I think it gave everyone the confidence for me to pursue art.

(01:08:31):
I ended up being a winner, there were multiple winners, of a national art competition, and I had my artwork displayed in the Rotunda Gallery. That then led to me getting a scholarship at the Rhode Island School of Design where I ended up going to RISD. It's like MIT for design or whatever. It's a prestigious art and design school. But I got to RISD and I realized I was born 100 years too late for what I wanted to do, which is draw and paint. And I felt like at that point, photography and now AI generated art, but certainly even back then, photography was replacing a lot of the skills that I had. And that's when I was in my freshman year of college and I learned about a field called industrial design. They said industrial design is the design of everything from a toothbrush to a spaceship and everything in between.

(01:09:26):
And really, Lenny, maybe just to round out the story, because that was a fun fact, but I'm just ... And this is the pre founding story that I never tell. I don't think I could have ever done what I did if I wasn't an industrial designer. I think industrial designer is different than a graphic designer. Because an industrial designer, you have to work with engineering in your training. I worked with mechanical engineers, electric engineers. You have to understand manufacturing. Industrial design's very accountable to sales. If you design a building, an architect, and you design an office building and the office building doesn't get leased, the architect's usually not on the hook for it. But if you're an industrial designer and you design a product, it doesn't sell, you're on the hook for it. At least people assume you didn't design a good product. So you had to understand marketing and strategy.

(01:10:11):
And so that became this gateway. But I didn't really want to make items and objects my whole life. At RISD, the biggest value I got in addition to learning industrial design was I met my co-founder, Joe Gebbia. And the day of graduation Joe looks to me, he says, "Brian, I think we're going to start a company together one day." And I had no idea what he was referring to. So I moved to Los Angeles where I work as an industrial designer for two years when one day I got a package in the mail that changed my life. I opened this package and it's a seat cushion with a handle on it. And it's a letter from Joe, my friend from RISD. He said, "I started a company and everyone in San Francisco ... I live in San Francisco and all these people are starting companies. You should come here." And this is in 2007. YouTube had just come out. I had seen all these Steve Jobs keynotes finally on YouTube. I didn't know who he was. I'd never heard his voice before YouTube. And Apple had this renaissance and Google was on fire and Facebook was taking off. And it felt like the gears of the world that were turning were in San Francisco.

(01:11:18):
And so one day I go into work and I quit my job. My boss is dumbfounded. And I pack everything in the backseat of old Honda Civic. I get to San Francisco and Joe tells me the rent is $1,150. I don't have enough money to pay our rent. This design conference is coming to San Francisco. All the hotels are sold out. We said, what if we turned our house into a bed and breakfast for the design conference? I didn't have any beds, but Joe had beds and we called it Air Bed and Breakfast.

(01:11:45):
So my fun fact was I was an artist and designer before Airbnb. Really an artist, at least how I thought about it. And I think that's maybe one of the things that makes Airbnb different. Because there's not a lot of designers or artists running Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies. And I think that intuition, imagination, design, curiosity, I think we need more of that. By the way, I think the people listening, I think everyone on this, listen, you have these qualities. But I think that a lot of companies, it's like we're a body and the companies are cut off at the head and they're disembodied from their heart, and they're often really biased towards one side of their head. And I think that some of the greatest scientists played musical instruments like Einstein. I think that being a whole, well-rounded way of thinking about the world is good. So anyways, that's my final thought.

## Transcript

Itamar Gilad (00:00:00):
You fake it, you do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz tests. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and behind the scenes and according to the permissions that the users gave us some of us moved just the subject and the sender into the right place. So initially the interviewer kind of distracted them and then showed them their inbox and then the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place more or less if we got it right. And people were like, "Wow, this is actually very cool." But it gave us some evidence to go and say, "Hey, we should try and build this thing."

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Itamar Gilad. Itamar, is a product coach, author, speaker and former longtime product manager at Google where you worked on Gmail, identity and YouTube. He also just published an awesome new book called Evidence-Guided: Creating High-Impact Products in the Face of Uncertainty. Itamar, has an important perspective on why and also how you can push your team and organization from an opinion-based decision-making process to a more evidence guided approach. In our conversation, Itamar, shares a number of very practical and handy frameworks that do just that including the confidence meter, metrics trees, GIST and the GIST board, plus his take on how people often misuse ICE for prioritizing ideas. Also, how you could make your OKRs more effective and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Itamar Gilad, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company.

(00:01:49):
I actually used Ezra, earlier this year unrelated to this podcast completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening which means they didn't find anything cancerous. But they did find some issues in my back which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:02:40):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra, team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be is what I have or fatty liver disease. Ezra, scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free and Ezra, is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny. That's E-Z-R-A.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

Itamar Gilad (00:04:40):
It's a pleasure being here, thank you for inviting me.

Lenny (00:04:42):
It's my pleasure. I thought we'd start with the story of your work on Google+ and Gmail and how those experiences formed your perspective on how to build a successful product. Can you share that story?

Itamar Gilad (00:04:57):
Google+ was my first experience at Gmail, I joined Gmail in August 2011 and the first thing they asked me is, "Let's connect Gmail with Google+." If you're hazy about the story, back then Facebook was massive. It's still massive but then it was growing like mushrooms, people were spending hours. That really freaked out Google and the obvious solution was to launch a social network of Google called Google+ and we all believe in this thing, it really caught on very well initially we all used it, we all believed in it. So our mission was to build this thing and Google really cut no costs. It created a whole new division within Google and it created a whole strategy around Google+ and we had to connect Gmail and YouTube and search to Google+ to make them more personalized in a sense and more social. So that was the idea and we went on and we launched a series of features in Gmail for a couple of years, honestly and Google+ itself became this massive project, very feature rich and with a lot of redesigns and iterations and none of it worked.

(00:06:09):
It turned out people actually didn't need another social network, people didn't love it, people didn't use it. Eventually in Gmail we rolled back all the Google+ integration a few years later and Google+ itself was shut down in 2019. So putting aside all the tremendous waste that went into this, all the millions of person hours and personal weeks. In hindsight, not only did Google bet on the wrong thing it missed much easier opportunities. So just not far from Google's headquarters there was WhatsApp, not very famous in the US but they actually created massive impact. Hundreds of millions of people were using their stuff and they became a threat to Facebook much more than Google was. So Google missed the opportunity of social mobile apps like WhatsApp, like Snapchat, etc and for me this story kind of was the epitome of what I call today, opinion-based development. We come up with an idea, we believe in it, all the indications show it's good.

(00:07:13):
Maybe the early tests show it's good, then we just go all in and we try to implement it and I made this very mistake many times as the product manager, I was the guy pushing for the ideas. So for me, this was kind of a turning point I felt we need to adopt a different system.

Lenny (00:07:32):
And just before you move on to the next story, how big was the team? Roughly how many years was spent on this area? Just to give people a sense of the waste as you said.

Itamar Gilad (00:07:41):
So there was a tremendous earthquake inside Google to create the Google+ team, teams and the entire divisions were kind of thrown apart and reformatted and I think at its peak it was about 1000 people inside-

Lenny (00:07:55):
Wow, [inaudible 00:07:56].

Itamar Gilad (00:07:56):
It was a division the size of Android and Docs and a really sizable thing, they're under their own buildings. It's taken from the playbook of Steve Jobs, create this whole secretive project inside and just run like hell.

Lenny (00:08:13):
Yeah. I remember though Facebook was really scared, I remember they shut everything down. It as like a code DEFCON one situation too, so it really scared Facebook at the same time.

Itamar Gilad (00:08:22):
Yeah, it's true. But at the end of the day, neither Google's advertising revenue was affected, neither was Facebook affected. So it turned out this idea was not that necessary after all.

Lenny (00:08:35):
Yeah, okay. So that's an example of something that didn't work because it was opinion based software, I think the phrase you used and then there's a different experience with tabs I think with Gmail.

Itamar Gilad (00:08:47):
That's right. So Google, is a very successful company. It's not for me to criticize it or to in hindsight kind of say you guys need to be better and some of the people that were behind Google+ was some of the smartest leaders and I still think they are despite this story. If you look back at the history of Google, how things started in the first decade or so. Google, was what I call an evidence guided company. So essentially it put a high premium on focusing on customers, coming up with a lot of ideas on looking at the data, looking at how these ideas actually worked out. They weren't shy about launching betas and things that were very rough and incomplete and learning from that and then they expected people to take action based on the results. So fail fast is a very famous paradigm and so you had to kill your project or pivot it seriously if it didn't work out and I think had we kept fail fast it would've really have helped Google+, if we had this mentality.

(00:09:56):
But for some reason with Google+, Google put this playbook aside and used a different playbook which I call plan and execute essentially. But I think inside Google the DNA still existed. So inside Gmail, the next project after Google+ was the tabbed inbox. So it was kind of the reverse of Google+, it started as a very small idea that no one believed in and we started looking what's behind the city? What's the goal? What's the problem actually we're trying to solve? It turned out that a lot of people were receiving social notifications and promotions, etc, and most of them were very passive. They weren't clearing their inbox, they were just living in this world of clutter and I came up with an idea how to fix this. I was sure it was great, I wanted to push it, plan and execute, but my colleagues were like, "Hold on, we actually tried this. We have a bunch of ideas to help people organize their inbox, they're not using it. Why is your idea good?"

(00:10:57):
So that sent us, kind of me and my team into researching these users into establishing a goal that was much more user-centric and then thinking of other ideas. And then we started testing them much more rigorously and basically we started testing on our own inboxes and then we recruited other dog footers, other Googlers to test the same inbox, then we put it outside for external testers. We did usability studies, we did data, we built a whole data mining team and a whole machine learning team to build the right categorization and we ended up with a solution that turned out to be very successful for a lot of these passive users. This was a surprise to a lot of people because most of my colleagues and most of the people I talk with actually know how to manage their inbox. So for them that solution makes complete nonsense, like splitting promotions and social to the side sounds like the stupidest idea. But there's about 85% of the population, 85 to 88% that absolutely love it and today Gmail has about 1.8 billion active users according to Gmail.

(00:12:14):
Most of these users are using this feature, so it was a pretty high impact feature as well.

Lenny (00:12:20):
And the feature specifically, just in case people aren't totally getting it is the promotions folder and the social I think and then the regular.

Itamar Gilad (00:12:27):
Yeah, there are a couple more that you can enable in settings if you like.

Lenny (00:12:30):
Yeah, I use it, I love it. Except it puts my newsletter in people's promotions folder, who do I talk to about that?

Itamar Gilad (00:12:36):
Yeah. Newsletters are a very complicated scenario for the categorization engine.

Lenny (00:12:41):
Yeah. We just need an exception for my newsletter and then we're good. Okay, but go on.

Itamar Gilad (00:12:45):
So in hindsight I was asking and saying, "Why was this project so different?" And I think the reason is that we didn't have that much confidence in our opinions. We had opinions, we had ideas but we didn't just go all in and just let's build it. We actually used an evidence guided system and I think that's not unique just to Google. I think every successful product company out there that you look at Amazon, Airbnb, anyone you will check, at least in their best periods they found a way to balance human judgment with evidence. They didn't try to obliterate human judgment and opinion just to supercharge them with evidence and they came up with very different models. Apple, is another example but the principle still holds in all of these companies.

Lenny (00:13:33):
Awesome. So you took that experience and all the experience you've had from coaching product leaders working with companies and you wrote this book called Evidence-Guided, which people on YouTube could see sitting there behind you. So I want to talk through some of these stories and then some of these other lessons and frameworks that emerged. But maybe just to start, what's the elevator pitch for this book?

Itamar Gilad (00:13:55):
So this is a book for people like us, product people who want to bring evidence guided thinking or modern product management if you like into their organizations. There's a lot of challenges, it's not simple, we all read the books, we all know the theory, we all know some parts of the system. It tries to give you a system how to do that, it's a meta framework that kind of helps you lift your organization in the direction of evidence guidance if that's what you want to do.

Lenny (00:14:23):
So going back to the story briefly before we get into the frameworks and lessons of the book. In the first example of Google+, basically it came top down, "Hey, we need to build a social network, go build it." Obviously that happens at a lot of companies, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. But are there cases where it does make sense to approach it that way? Obviously Apple is a classic example of Steve Jobs, is like we need to build an iPhone. I don't know if that's exactly how it went. But are there instances where it is worth just approaching new product ideas that way based on the experience and creativity and insights of the founder? Or is your thinking it should always come from this evidence-based approach?

Itamar Gilad (00:15:01):
I think the founders are very important, especially in the startup and scale-ups phase. They come up with many of the most important ideas and it's super important that they have the space to express and to push the organization to look at those. However, it's not about shutting them down it's about looking at them critically. You need to create the environment in the organization where the leader comes and says, "You know what? I talked to these three customers, I figured it out. Here's what we need to do in the next five years." And you need to ask, "Where's your evidence?" And by the way, the example you give that's a classic example. Steve Jobs, he just brainstorm in his kitchen the iPhone and then just told the team to build it. That's the story Steve Jobs, told but it's not the real story at all. Now we know what actually happened and the iPhone has actually a story of discovery, of trial and error, multiple projects to do it, multitouch with phones, most of them failed.

(00:16:02):
Steve Jobs, was the architect. He kind of managed to connect the dots and eventually come up with this perfect device but he wasn't actually the creator, it wasn't his brainchild. He was actually against it for a while but over time as he saw the evidence, as he saw what this thing can do, as he saw the demos he was able to piece together something that was very useful.

Lenny (00:16:26):
That's really important insight. People that are hearing this might feel like I like this idea of pushing back and encouraging the founders to make it more evidence guided. In the case of say Google+, was it even possible? Could you have come to Larry and Sergey and be like, "Here's all this data I've gathered that tells us this is not going to work?" Do you have any advice for how to push back and encourage the founders and execs to really take the counterpoint seriously or really kind of vet their idea?

Itamar Gilad (00:16:58):
So another nice thing about Google is that it's a very open culture and people are not shy to tell even Sergey and Larry that they are wrong and they do this all the time. In certain forms, right? You need to know the right channels. But there was a very big discussion about Google+ and whether it's the right thing to create a clone of Facebook, there was a very public internal discussion. I think what I would change is not have this discussion based on opinions, because when you have the discussion you come with your own opinions usually the most senior person's opinions will win. That's just the way it is. If we had come with hard data and we said, "Listen, things are not actually panning out the way you guys are expecting. What can we do? Should we continue? Should we pivot this?" I think the discussion would've done better. Now I'm doing a huge disservice, I was not in all the discussions. I know probably in Google+, there were very serious discussions happening along these lines.

(00:18:02):
But it's just as a general trend, I find that evidence is very empowering for us smaller people in the organization or mid-level managers to be empowered to challenge the opinions.

Lenny (00:18:15):
Is there anything tactically you found to be useful and effective in giving people, say they don't work at Google. They work at companies where founders and bosses and execs are not as open to challenge. [inaudible 00:18:26] any tactically found about how to present a counter proposal or like, "Hey, I have this data that we should really pay attention to?"

Itamar Gilad (00:18:33):
I think if you come with data, if you run a secret experiment and you come back and you show them you usually get one of two results. Either they get extremely mad at you and they tell you to get back to work and to do what you were told and in that case, probably you need to start polishing your resume and look for another place either inside the organization or outside it because that person is not being reasonable to be honest. But the more common case is they're pleasantly surprised and that's what happened with Steve Jobs, as well. He was against phones but then people showed him all sorts of evidence that Apple can make a phone. He was against multitouch initially but then he changed his mind, there was a lot of back and forth. So even, Steve Jobs, given evidence was willing to flip and I say this in many organizations. So evidence is so powerful, that's why this is the principle I based the book on.

Lenny (00:19:28):
You have this concept of being evidence guided. People listening may feel like, "Hey, we're evidence guided, we're in experiments, we make decisions using data." Oftentimes they aren't actually and so what are signs that maybe you're not actually that evidence guided or as evidence guided as you think you are?

Itamar Gilad (00:19:45):
I think there's a few telltale signs that I look for, first the goals are very unclear. Either there are many or they're very kind of obscure and vague or they are about output, there's misalignment. So the goals part is not there, usually this goes hand in hand with metrics. Missing metrics or just using revenue and business metric but there's no user facing metrics. So that's another telltale sign, then there's a lot of time and effort spent on planning especially on road mapping. Creating the perfect roadmap which really can consume a lot of time of the top management and PMs, etc. Then as you go down you see there's not a lot of experimentation and if there is experimentation there's not a lot of learning and finally another telltale sign is that the team is disengaged. So the engineers are kind of getting the signal that what they need to do is deliver, they're focused on output, that's what they're measured on. So they're kind of disengaged, they're disengaged from the users, from the business, they don't care that much.

(00:20:57):
It's usually something that you can fix by adopting a more evidence guided system.

Lenny (00:21:05):
Okay. So let's dive into your approach to becoming more evidence guided. In the book, you share this model that you call the GIST model which is kind of this overarching approach to building a product that almost forces you to be more evidence guided. So let's just start with what's the simplest way to understand this GIST model?

Itamar Gilad (00:21:26):
With your permission, I can show a few slides.

Lenny (00:21:28):
Oh, let's do it.

Itamar Gilad (00:21:29):
And maybe that will help.

Lenny (00:21:32):
Here we go, and then yeah, a good excuse to go check this out on YouTube.

Itamar Gilad (00:21:36):
All right, you're seeing this? So this is the GIST model, goals, ideas, steps and tasks, and essentially it's tries to break the change which is a really big change for a lot of companies into four slightly more manageable parts. They're still big but each one you can tackle on its own and that's kind of the reason I kind of split it, and goals are about defining what we're trying to achieve, ideas are hypothetical ways to achieve the goals, steps are ways to implement the idea and validate it at the same time. So essentially build, measure learn loops and tasks are the things we manage in Kanban and Jira and all these good tools. These are the things that your development team is usually very focused on and just listening to this, a lot of this will sound familiar to you because GIST is not a brand new invention. It's a meta framework that puts in place a lot of existing methodologies. It's based on lean startup, on design thinking, product discovery, growth, There's a lot of all of these things here. It just tries to put them all into one framework or one model.

Lenny (00:22:43):
So what's the simplest way to think about what this model is meant for? Is this how you think about your roadmap? Is this how you plan? What is this trying to tell people to do differently in the way they build product broadly?

Itamar Gilad (00:22:56):
I would say these are four areas that you need to look at and ask, are we doing the right thing in each? In each you may need to change or even transform and as I go and explain each one of those I'll give you basically three things. In each chapter in the book I try to touch on three things. The principles behind them, the frameworks or models that implement the principles and then process and the process honestly is the most brittle part and the one that you would need to change and adapt to your company. Because not two companies are exactly the same, and it's very tempting when you write a book not to give any process but that's the part that people actually want the most. So it's included as well, but just be aware that you will have to change this process.

Lenny (00:23:44):
Awesome. Okay, so we're going to talk about each of these four layers. Before we do that, where do vision and strategy fit into this? Do they bucket into one of these four layers and how do you think about strategy and vision?

Itamar Gilad (00:23:55):
That's a great question, so there's this whole strategic context that is outside of GIST. GIST, is not trying to tackle that, it assumes it's in place, there's another huge blob which is research. GIST, is not about research it's more about discovery and delivery. But strategy is extremely important and you can use some of the tools we will talk about to develop your strategy as well. In many companies the strategy is just a roadmap on steroids, it's small plan and execute just on a grand scale and Google+ again, was a strategic choice actually if you think about it. So in the book there is a chapter where I touch on strategy and I explain how the same evidence guided methods are being used by companies to develop their strategy as well.

Lenny (00:24:43):
Awesome, maybe one last context question. So people might be seeing this and thinking okay cool, I have goals, I have ideas steps, I have tasks, I'm already doing this. What is this kind of a counter or reaction to? What are people probably missing when they're seeing this and they're like, "Oh, I see. This is like what we're not doing and this is the most important, this is something we should probably change." And we'll go through these in detail too.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:03):
I think talking about each one will help.

Lenny (00:25:06):
Okay, let's do it.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:09):
But we can talk about in each level what's actually being done. So when people say I have goals, usually they take the goals layer and use it as a planning session. They talk about what shall we build by when, what are the resources? And that's actually not goals at all, that's planning work.

Lenny (00:25:26):
Cool, let's talk about goals and I know part of this is OKRs related too, so I'm excited to hear your take on OKRs.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:33):
Oh, that's a whole different discussion. You had, Christina, the real expert over there so I doubt I can add more to that. But it's true OKR is all part of it, but let's start with goals. What's our goals supposed to be? Goals are supposed to paint the end state to define where we want to end up and the evidence will not guide you unless you know where you want to go, and in many companies what you have is goals at the top for revenue, market share, whatever it is, and then a bunch of siloed goals for each department. There's engineering goals, there's design goals, there's marketing goals, etc, and that actually pushes people into different vectors and it's really hard to decide. I would argue that in evidence guided companies, and you've worked for a few so probably you've seen this. They use models in order to construct overarching goals for the entire organization. One of the models I show in the chapter about goals is the value exchange loop.

(00:26:34):
 Where basically the organization is trying to deliver as much value as it can to the market and to capture as much value back, and by creating a feedback loop between these two you are actually able to grow very fast. Now, I would argue that you want to measure both of these and to put a metric on each and the metric we usually use to measure value delivered is called the North Star metric. I know you wrote an article, a very good article about it.

Lenny (00:27:01):
Thank you.

Itamar Gilad (00:27:02):
And in it you listed dozens and dozens of companies, like leading companies and what they considered the North Star metric is super interesting. I would argue that what they told you is what is the most important metrics we measure? What is the number one metric for us? But it's not what I call the North Star metric, the North Star metric measures how much value we create for the market. For example, let's take WhatsApp. WhatsApp for a very long time measured messages sent because every message sent is a little incremental of value for the sender, the receiver, it's free, it's rich media, you can send it for anywhere in the world, compared to SMS that's huge value. So if in year one we have a billion messages being sent in year two, two billion probably we doubled the amount of value. In Airbnb, I think one of your key metrics or the real North Star metric was nights booked. I don't know if it was still the case while you were there?

Lenny (00:27:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Itamar Gilad (00:27:56):
And there are examples like this in Amplitude for example, they measure active learning users or weekly active learning users. Which are users that found in the tool some insight that was so important that they shared it with at least two other users and they consume it. So it's a very powerful thing to point at this metric and say, "This is the most important metric combined with the value metric that we want to capture, revenue, market share, whatever it is." Once you have these two, you can further break them down into what I call metrics trees. So there's a metric three for the North Star metric and there's the metric three for the top KPI, the top business metric which you see here on the left side in blue and usually they overlap. So you might find in the middle some metrics that are super, super important because moving them actually moves the needle on everything else.

Lenny (00:28:57):
Can you clarify again the difference between what you call this top KPI versus North Star metric?

Itamar Gilad (00:29:02):
So the North Star metric is measuring how much value we're creating for the user, the core value that they're getting. In this case this is some productivity suite, so this is number of documents created per month for example. Because we think that every document created maybe it's a small document, I don't know. AI is in fashion now, is a little incremental value, so that's the number we're trying to grow. The top KPI is what we expect to get, it should be revenue or profit.

Lenny (00:29:31):
I see, this is the value exchange. I see, one is what users are getting, one is what you're getting back from them.

Itamar Gilad (00:29:36):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:29:37):
Basically how the business is benefiting. Awesome. I think this is a really important concept, the metric tree. I think a lot of people think they have something like this in mind where they're just like, "Cool, here's our North Star Metric, here's the levers and things that we can work on to move that." But I think actually mapping it out the way you have it here where it kind of goes layers and layers deep to all of the different variables that impact this metric. Not only is it a way to think about impact and goals and things like that, but also helps you estimate the impact of the experiment you're potentially thinking about running. So if you're going to work on something at the bottom here like activation rate, say you move that 10%. How much is that going to impact this global metric? It's probably a very small amount.

Itamar Gilad (00:30:19):
This is a very important one and we'll talk about impact assessment shortly, this helps with it. It also helps with alignment because the entire organization is trying to move these two metrics, it's the two sides of our mission essentially. We have the mission that's the top objective of the company and these are the two top most key results if you like, the top most things. So when you go and work with another team and you say, "Hey, why don't you work on my project?" They might say, "This idea actually might move the North Star metric model in your idea." And that helps you guys align and I've seen cases where team B put aside their own ideas to jump on the ideas of team A, because of this model. It also creates an opportunity to give some sub metrics to teams to own on an ongoing basis, so it creates a little sense of ownership as well and mission within the tree.

Lenny (00:31:10):
It also helps you figure out what teams you should have, which teams have the biggest potential to impact the metric.

Itamar Gilad (00:31:18):
Another thing that happens in a lot of organizations, the team topology reflects the structure of the software or some hierarchical model where we want to organize the organization in a particular way. But if you start with a metrics tree, you can try to arrange the topology around goals and sometimes you need to readjust. It's not a constant reorg but from time to time you will realize the goals have changed and we need to reorganize, so the tree helps visualize that as well.

Lenny (00:31:49):
I think for people that are listening to this and thinking about this, I think the simplest way to even think about this is basically there's a math formula that equals your North Star metric or your revenue or whatever you're trying to do and if you don't have some ideally really clear sense of what that math formula is you should work on that. Because that will inform so much of how you think about where to invest, what teams to have, where to invest more resources, less resources.

Itamar Gilad (00:32:13):
Right.

Lenny (00:32:15):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team, for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4 they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn, generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn, have two times the buying power of the average web audience and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.

(00:33:20):
Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign, just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny, terms and conditions apply. Okay. So metrics trees, what comes next?

Itamar Gilad (00:33:39):
All right. So next we need to go to the ideas layer and the ideas layer is there to help us sort through the many ideas we might encounter and they may come from as you said the founders, the managers, the stakeholders, from the team, from research, from competitors. We're flooded with ideas, and what usually happens inside organization is some sort of battle of opinions or some sort of politics sometimes or highest paid person's opinion. You had, Ronny Kohavi, who invented this term in your show. What doesn't happen is very rational, logical decisions these are the best ideas, because it's really, really hard to predict honestly. There is so much uncertainty in the needs of the users, in the changes in the market, in our technology, in our product, in our own organization. It's almost impossible to say this idea is going to be the best, but we do say this because we have cognitive biases that kind of convince us that this idea is far superior to anything else and it's definitely the right choice.

(00:34:48):
In order to avoid this, what we want to do is to evaluate the ideas in a much more objective and consistent and transparent way. In the book I suggest using ICE, impact, confidence and ease. I think I have a slide coming on this. So impact, confidence and ease which is basically a way to assign three values to each idea. The impact tries to assess how much impact it'll have on the goals and that's why it's so important that we have very clear goals and not many. How we are measuring the ideas on the North Star metric, on the top business KPI, on a local metric of the team. Whatever it is, let's be clear about it and then let's evaluate the ideas against this thing. Ease, is basically the opposite of effort. How easy or hard it's going to be, but both of those are guesstimates, both of those are things we need to estimate. I would argue that just by breaking the question to these two questions we usually have a slightly better discussion than just my idea is better than yours.

(00:35:52):
But then there's the third element which is confidence, which tries to assess how sure are we or should we be about our first guesstimates about the impact and the ease.

Lenny (00:36:03):
It's interesting you use the word ease, because I think it's usually effort. You kind of make it positive, is that an intentional tweak you made?

Itamar Gilad (00:36:12):
I'm using the definitions of, Sean Ellis. Sean, invented ICE. You know Sean, I don't know if you've had him yet? But he's-

Lenny (00:36:21):
I haven't had him on yet.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:23):
Yeah. For the people who don't know him, Sean, is amazing. He's like one of the fathers of the growth movement, he coined the term growth hacking and he popularized the concept of product market fit.

Lenny (00:36:36):
Yeah.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:36):
He created ICE, he created a bunch of things that we use in product that we don't even know.

Lenny (00:36:40):
Wow, I didn't know he came up with ICE. Okay, cool. So the original version of ICE is ease instead of effort.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:45):
Exactly, yeah.

Lenny (00:36:45):
Fun fact.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:47):
A lot of your viewers are wondering where's the R because there's another variant of this culture. RICE, where there's rich as well. I prefer ICE because I prefer to fold the rich into the I for various reasons but both are valid, both are equivalent in a sense.

Lenny (00:37:04):
I'm in your boat, that's exactly how I think about it. I think people over complicate this stuff and try to get so many math formulas involved with estimating impact, and I feel like these are just simple heuristics to kind of bubble the best ideas to the top. It doesn't have to be a perfect estimate of impact and confidence and all those things, so I think the simpler is better and it always ends up being a spreadsheet. People always have these tools to estimate these things but it's like a spreadsheet, Google Sheets. Great.

Itamar Gilad (00:37:28):
So yeah, you're actually leading me to my next point. So when you come to estimate impact you will realize it's the hardest part. So sometimes it's just a gut feeling and it's a guess and sometimes it's based on some spreadsheet or some analysis and the back of envelope calculation you've done and I think that's legitimate. Sometimes these things do show you some things you didn't think of and sometimes the best case it's based on tests. You actually tested it, you interviewed 12 customers, you show them the thing and out of those only one actually liked it. You should reduce your impact based on that usually, or you do other types of tests. We'll talk about testing in a second. What happens is that people tend to just go with gut instinct and then give themselves a high confidence. They say it's an eight and I'm pretty convinced, so it's eight for confidence and I found this a bit disturbing because it kind of subverts the whole system.

(00:38:22):
So I wanted to help people realize when they have strong evidence in support of their guesses and when it's weak evidence, how to calculate confidence in a sense. For that I created a tool called the confidence meter, which you can see here this colorful thing and should I go and explain it?

Lenny (00:38:41):
Yeah, let's do it. And then again, if you're just listening to this you can check this out on YouTube and you can see the actual slide.

Itamar Gilad (00:38:47):
All right, awesome. So basically I constructed it a bit like a thermo meter. It goes from very low confidence which is the blue area or the upper right, all the way to high confidence which is the red area and you can see the numbers going from zero to 10. Where zero is very low confidence, we don't know basically anything we're just guessing in the dark and 10 is full confidence. You know for sure this thing is a success, no doubt about it and across the circle I put various classes of evidence you might find along the way. So for example, starting at the top right, all of these blue areas about opinions. It could be your own self-confidence in the idea, your self conviction, you feel it's a great idea. Guess what? Behind every terrible idea that was ever someone thought it was great, that gives you 0.01 out of 10. Maybe you created a shiny pitch deck or a six-page document that explains in detail why this is a great idea. Slightly harder to do but still very low confidence, maybe you connected it to some theme, it's about the blockchain...

(00:39:59):
Well sorry, the blockchain is out of fashion. What's hot right now?

Lenny (00:39:59):
AI.

Itamar Gilad (00:40:04):
Exactly, AI. It's about AI, that makes it a good idea? Absolutely not. Or the strategy of the company, that's another thematic support. Thousands and thousands of terrible ideas are being implemented right now as we speak based on these themes. So all these things combined can give you a maximum 0.1 out of 10 according to the tool, if you follow it then we move into slightly harder tests. One is reviewing it with your colleagues, your managers, your stakeholders the idea. They don't know it either, they don't have a crystal ball, they're usually not the users, they cannot predict. But they can evaluate it in a slightly more objective way and maybe find flaws in your idea. On the other hand groups tend to have biases too, politics group thing. So groups can actually arrive sometimes with worse decisions than individuals, there's some research to that. Next, our estimates and plans. So you may do some sort of back of the envelope calculation or your colleagues might go out and try to evaluate the ease a little bit better.

(00:41:07):
That gives you a little bit more confidence, but still we're at the level of guesswork at this point. Next we're moving to data and data could be anecdotal. So you find a few data points dotted across your data or you talk to a handful of customers or maybe one competitor has that same idea. In many companies I meet, if the leading competitor has this feature and we think it's a good idea validation is done. Let's launch it, that's it. It's a great idea, we need to do it. It never works honestly, you should not assume that your competitor actually knows what they're doing anymore than you do. Data could be also what I call market data. That comes from surveys, from assessing a lot of your data by doing a deep competitive analysis and there are other methods where you create a larger dataset and you contrast your idea against it. Finally, to gain medium and high confidence you really need to build your idea and test it and that's where the red area is.

(00:42:11):
So there's various forms of tests, we'll talk about them if we have time and they give you various levels of confidence.

Lenny (00:42:19):
Awesome, this is a very cool visual. We'll link to a image of this in the show notes too if people want to check it out. I think what's awesome about this is you could just use this as a little tool on your team of just like where are we along the spectrum? We think the impact of this is very high. But we're probably in this blue area of confidence and so let's just make sure we understand that and it's really clear language to help people understand. I see if we had this, it'd be a lot more confident.

Itamar Gilad (00:42:45):
So you can also tie your investment into the idea based on the level of confidence you had found essentially, so early on you want to do the cheap stuff just to gain more confidence and then you can go and invest more. If it's a really cheap idea, you can jump to a high confidence idea, you can test, you can do an AB experiment. Early adopter program, whatever it is and then launch it. Some ideas you don't need to test, sometimes the expert opinion is enough. If you're just changing the order of the settings, no one sees this or no one will be impacted. The risk is low, you can launch it without testing. So part of the trick is also knowing when to stop, not just trying to force your way all the way up when you don't have to.

Lenny (00:43:31):
That's a really important point. The other important point here is just a big part of a PM's job is to say no and to stop stupid shit from happening and this is an awesome tool to help you do that. To be like, okay, here's this idea you have, just like let's just be real, how confident are we in this? And, okay, it's going to take us three months to do this. Maybe we should think about something different, maybe we should work up the confidence meter before we actually commit to this.

Hey, Casey Winters. What do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (00:02:00):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart, because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, you know I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. They're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (00:02:36):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:03):
Manik, welcome to the podcast.

Manik Gupta (00:03:06):
Thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here, man.

Lenny (00:03:08):
I don't know if it's obvious, but I am quite honored to have you on this podcast. You've had such an illustrious career as a founder leading the Google Maps team, as CPO at Uber for, I believe, four years. Now you're kind of a fancy VP at Microsoft on consumer stuff. It's this incredible career and trajectory. My first question is, looking back at your career, what would you say is maybe the one or two main things that you did that helped you get to where you are today? For folks that are maybe earlier in the career, of what they should be focusing on.

Manik Gupta (00:03:39):
Yeah. Thanks, Lenny, for having me. I'm also a big fan of yours, by the way. I love your newsletter and it's been incredible to just see how you have also grown both the set of topics that you cover and this podcast. Just really a big fan, so again, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:54):
Appreciate that.

Manik Gupta (00:03:55):
Let me start by telling you a little bit about my philosophy of this. I'm maybe a little bit late to the party, but I recently read this book from Morgan Hausel on Psychology of Money. And I highly recommend your listeners read it if they get a chance. There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part.

(00:04:45):
This is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, which is what are some of the patterns of people who have had multiple careers and have gone through a journey where they've learned a lot and they've contributed and things like that? I think there are two patterns that stand out, both when I look at myself in terms of what I've been through, and also when I talk to a lot of my friends who have also gone on and done interesting things, and I wanted to cover both of that. The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find.

(00:05:16):
It was so funny. I was watching the Warriors game last night, and yeah Warriors, we won the NBA championship. That's great.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Go Warriors.

Manik Gupta (00:05:24):
One of the reporters, I think she asked Steve Kerr, the coach, "What's the secret?" And he goes, "Well just hang around superstars." That's what he said and he just passed the mic over to somebody else and said, "Look, this is a team that's hanging around superstars." And that's exactly what it is. If you're create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career as you asked, around hanging around people who are doing interesting things and they're doing things which really are different, or they're doing things in a different manner and it's exciting, the right things will happen.

(00:05:55):
I was lucky in a way that I caught myself in that situation. I grew up in India and when I was 16 I got a scholarship to move to Singapore to do my high school and then my undergrad studies. It just turned out that during those days, Singapore... I mean it still is, but it was a melting pot for the best and brightest folks that you can get from all over the Asia diaspora if you will. Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore. We were just part of that ecosystem and it gave me a lot of opportunities to try out different things in college and so on and so forth.

(00:06:44):
I think the main thing that I would say here for people who are early in career is just surround yourself with people who are really good at what they do. Learn from them. And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way. Anyway, that's pattern number one. I think that has helped me a lot and I also see a lot of that in other folks whom I talk to.

(00:07:19):
Then the second pattern is... This is something I resonate a lot with personally, is I'm a strong technology optimist. There's always a lot of narrative these days around technology and maybe a little bit more pessimism, and I find that bizarre. I'm just such a strong technology advocate and optimist, because I feel technology's such a strong force for good. I grew up as an engineer myself, and I've always been attracted to projects where we can use technology to solve a real human need. I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well. The passion that you get if you're a strong advocate of technology and how it can really help, it just gets you to choose a set of things that you want to do at scale.

(00:08:06):
For instance, when I joined Google in India to work on Maps, it was all about helping millions of users, around Asia particularly, navigate their world. There wasn't a good solution like that, so how can you bring technology to really solve those problems?

(00:08:21):
I think those are the two patterns, Lenny. One is surrounding yourself with A plus people, and the second is just having very strong optimism and passion about technology. At least if I connect their dots looking backwards, those are the things that have really helped me and a bunch of other folks that I see in a similar situation. I'm hoping that folks early in their career thing through that.

Lenny (00:08:40):
I bet there's a big overlap between those two points, technology optimist and just superstars. That's interesting.

Manik Gupta (00:08:46):
Yeah, there definitely is. That's actually really good. I hadn't thought about that. You're right. I think there's definitely that overlap, because folks who are in that mode, they really get around more together. I'm also an angel investor and an investor in a bunch of companies. Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that. It's really about people who have the same kind of frequency in terms of thinking about the world outlook and they want to go on to do interesting things. I think that's really what drives the narrative forward.

Lenny (00:09:14):
Speaking of technology optimism and technology in general, of the things that you've worked on, what would you say you're most proud of project wise, product wise, feature wise?

Manik Gupta (00:09:23):
Yeah. Again, I've had just the incredible opportunity to be part of phenomenal companies that have created world changing products. I had a small, small, small part to play in that. I always emphasize that. It's not me, it was a team. And I really mean it. I'm not just saying it because I'm on your podcast, but it truly is. I'm particularly proud of the work that I did both at Google and at Uber. I'll give you a couple of examples to illustrate that point.

(00:09:47):
When I joined Google in India in 2008, I started off working on Google Maps and I remember how counterintuitive it was for anybody; my friends and family, a bunch of other folks whom I talked to. Counterintuitive in terms of why would anybody ever use maps on their mobile phone in India? The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, "Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?" That was the norm. That's how people navigated for a really long time.

(00:10:32):
When I started working on it, I think for me, my belief was, again going back to the tech optimism aspect, is why can't we in India have the same quality maps like we have in the United States? Why not? Why shouldn't we do it? Why are users here not getting the same benefit and same productivity gain, if you will, and less stress in their daily commute and things like that?

(00:10:55):
So we started building it. We started building the data. We went ahead and really mapped the country as much as we could. Both ourselves and through a lot of amazing work from our users who co-mapped the world with us. Over time, India became, I think, the second largest country for Google Maps in the world in terms of users. Of course, a lot of that happened because of Android. Android took off and Android had Google Maps on it. But it's just incredible to see how, in a short span of a few years, it just went up to becoming so useful. It's not that we were just distributing Google Maps on Android, people were using it. People were actually using it to go from point A to point B.

(00:11:35):
I feel really proud about that. I think the team did an incredible effort. It wasn't even a big team. It was a relatively small team, very passionate about going and doing this, and we made that happen.

(00:11:43):
Then at Uber, initially, before I took on the CPO role, I was leading maps and marketplace. When I was doing maps and marketplace, again, how do you get the ETA that you see on Uber when you open the Uber app and you request a car... The average ETA's went down to less than five minutes globally. Just think about that for a minute. In fact, it was 75 countries, more than 300 cities, if I remember correctly, where you could just open the Uber app and get an Uber in, average, less than five minutes. A lot of operational work need to happen for sure, but the technology, the marketplace technology especially to be able to connect the right rider to the right driver, have the mapping infrastructure underneath it to ensure that the car actually reaches you in that amount of time; I just feel very proud of all the work that happened during that time to make Uber really successful in terms of providing that kind of a service.

(00:12:37):
One fun anecdote I'll give you where my world came together and it just blows my mind even today, I remember I joined Uber in late 2015 and I made a trip to India to see my parents in sometime around 2016, 2017. I forget. It was around that time. And I was at home in Bangalore and I ordered an Uber. And the guy shows up, the driver comes in, and I sit in the back of the car. He starts the trip using the Uber app, and then he clicks Navigate and he goes to Google Maps. And I was sitting there. I was like, "Man, I built these two to a certain extent." It was just crazy to think about how two of my worlds came together at that point. I still vividly remember that moment where I felt really proud that I had a little bit of a part to play in both those products.

Lenny (00:13:26):
That is some unbelievable impact. It boggles my mind how many people have been impacted by the work that you've done on the teams that you've been on. Like a billion people in India and everyone in the world using Uber. It's unreal. I would feel very proud myself, watching that experience.

(00:13:41):
Something people may feel when they see a career like yours, they're like, "Man, Manik's just killing it. He's done everything. Everything just is clicking, always winning." I imagine there's been a few times when you've made mistakes or things have been really challenging. What would you say has been one of the more challenging projects or points in your career?

Manik Gupta (00:13:59):
Yeah. No, absolutely. This is really important to talk about as well, because we glamorize successes and we don't talk enough about challenges. I'm really happy that you're asking this. I would give you two times which... I had a lot of learning from both of them, but they were pretty tough times for me. The first time was, I had started my own company at the height of the dotcom boom. We incorporated our company in June '99, and then in March of 2000 we sold our company to another company from Norway. That was the peak of the dotcom boom. Then within a few months right after that, we had the dotcom bust and it was terrible. Terrible. I know we have a pretty bad economy right now. There's a lot of stuff going on. It was really bad, because people around me, my friends, were losing their jobs.

(00:14:52):
Luckily we had some funding. We had secured some of our funding and we had had an acquisition. The parent company was pretty strong in terms of their balance sheet, so we could continue to do it. But things didn't get better, Lenny. 2000 went by, 2001 came in. We kept waiting for things to improve, but they never improved. So we had to pivot. We had to pivot as a company. My co-founders actually left the company at that point. I still wanted to be there, because I really believed that I can keep moving this company forward. Then I was working with the founders of the parent company. We pivoted multiple times, we tried a few things. I even relocated back from Singapore back to India to set up an engineering office so that we can get into a SaaS kind of a model versus an eCommerce company that we were.

(00:15:35):
I tried many things over those two or three years. And remember, this was my first, quote unquote, "job" out of college. I was doing a lot of that and it was a very tough time. But at the same time I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself, I learned a lot about managing ambiguity and just keeping people motivated through a tough time. A lot of that also has to come from keeping yourself motivated, because people can smell fear and pessimism from far. Just like optimism is infectious, so is pessimism. If you're not feeling great as a leader, people will see it. Absolutely. People are not stupid. You have to not fake it. You have to really be motivated to stick it out, and that's what I tried to do at least, and I learned a lot in that. That was one really challenging time for me.

(00:16:21):
Then the second one was, man, during Uber. 2017, 2018 was crazy at Uber. Oh my God. There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well. It was something where you just had to keep your head down and just keep staying focused on what the core is.

(00:17:03):
I think that is where, Lenny, the optimism in me in terms of, what am I really doing? Is this a service that really benefits millions of people around the world? Are we creating true change? Those are things that I just have to dig deep into to make sure that I stay grounded on why am I here and why I remain to be here and then at the same time motivate my team. But yeah, those were the two really challenging times that I have encountered, at least in my career.

Lenny (00:17:26):
Those are awesome examples. I imagine a lot of founders are going through a lot of challenging times right now with the market, and imagine these experiences for you were really important and impacted your ability to take on bigger roles and bigger challenges in the future. Is that how you see it? These are important experiences to have over time as a product leader and just leader in general?

Manik Gupta (00:17:46):
Oh, absolutely. Because like I said, you learn a lot about yourself when you go through a situation like this. You learn both things that bother you or bring you down, and things that give you energy. It's sometimes counterintuitive to think about this. When you're going through a bad time, often then people will say, "Well, during a bad time I only learned things which are bad." But you also learn things that are good. Which is, maybe during a bad time you did something and you suddenly felt relieved or energized, and then you look at that and say, "Wait, I should do more of that even during a good time, because can you imagine the compounding power that I would get? Because stuff is good and I'm doing this and I'll feel even better."

(00:18:26):
I learned a lot in terms of my own personal energy, things that get me going, things that really stop me in my tracks. And at the same time, how do you work with a team? How do you motivate them? How do you keep your head down and focus, versus getting distracted? What are some of the decisions you make around your product roadmap?

(00:18:47):
I'll give you an example. During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, "Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers." We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter. The point was that you get confidence from getting things out, putting it out there, and you feel good about being a builder and being someone who is actually creating a difference. That really grounds the team and focuses the team that there is some real value here.

(00:19:45):
Some of those things I picked up. Both going through that turbulent time, I picked up. And I have used that even in good times to make sure that we keep building good products.

Lenny (00:19:56):
That's such a good tactical tip. Find a win. Keep people motivated. Speaking of wins, coming back to Google Maps and Uber, they're probably two of the most widely used, successful consumer products in the world. I don't know if I can think of other products that are used by more people for this long. Then now at Microsoft you're helping Microsoft get more into consumer on the communications side. I imagine you know a thing or two about building successful consumer apps, and so I want to ask a couple questions along those lines. What are two or three surprising or counterintuitive things that you've learned about building consumer products?

Manik Gupta (00:20:32):
The good news is that there's just... Because of Twitter and a bunch of other channels, including your newsletter by the way, I feel like people are very well informed these days. And I love that.

(00:20:43):
Let me digress for a second and then I'll come back to your question. One thing that I'm observing a lot, Lenny, which I feel very, very happy about, is the quality of learning and insights and frameworks and best practices is so universal at this point. It used to be that you had to be in the Valley or being part of a small group of folks who are doing things at the cutting edge to have those crazy insights about how do you find product market fit and do all that kind of stuff. Today I talk to people from all over the world for various reasons, and it's incredible how fast people pick up all these insights and frameworks and then they apply them to their local setting and so on. I find that to be one of the most wonderful things ever.

(00:21:32):
I think folks like you have obviously played a big part, because you have global subscribers and you share some of the best practices. But just generally, that's actually a really good thing for the world, that people have so much access to clarity of thinking. And the best people are actually putting themselves out there, which is great.

(00:21:47):
In terms of the counterintuitive stuff, I think two things. One is building consumer products is very hard. I think people think it's easy, because each of us is a consumer. We think of ourselves as a good user, we think of our friends as users, we think of our family as users. And we say, "Well, if we just build it for ourselves and for our family and friends..." By the way, a lot of great consumer products started that way, so I'm not saying don't do that. But man, it's hard. It takes a long time to get things right. Because you're essentially trying to get so many things right when you're building a successful consumer product. You have to be able to reach out to a vast, heterogeneous set of users who have different needs, who have different perspectives. The go to market is always very interesting, because you can't force people to use your product. People have to choose you, you don't choose them. That's the part where... How do you drive virality? How do you drive that real love for a consumer product? And it has to create real value.

(00:22:52):
The other thing about time is that, in order for you to find product market fit and then scale from there, you just have to try a lot of different things. There are theoretical playbooks around it, but you got to just get into it. Going back to the point I was making earlier about wins, get some wins and see the results and then iterate from there. I think it's just hard and it takes a lot longer than what people imagine consumer products do. Versus, let's say, enterprise products or products of other nature. That's one counterintuitive thing that at least I've learned.

(00:23:21):
The second one is the global patterns that you see in consumer products in terms of the user interface; the core things that people do or expect. At this point along of that is pretty universal. There's always this debate where people would say, "Well, need to have one product for the U.S., another different type of product for Asia, another different type of product for Africa. I think we are past that point. That's again another counterintuitive thing, where people spend a little too much... I've seen this in many companies. People spend too much time debating that, "Oh, the users in market X are different." Well yes, they're different, but they use the product the same way.

(00:24:02):
That's the part which I think... And I'm not making an argument against localization. Of course you need localization around language, pricing. There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.

(00:24:33):
That's the other counterintuitive thing that people should know about consumer products. Build for the world from day one. Understand that there are going to be some nuances that you'll have to solve as you drive adoption in certain markets, but don't over index on building market specific solutions, because consumers have moved on from that kind of a model. Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years.

Lenny (00:25:02):

(00:26:04):
Before this chat, we were chatting about this idea of company product fit for bigger companies. How it's an approach to building new products within big companies. Can you just talk about that idea?

Manik Gupta (00:26:17):
Yeah, absolutely. I've been noodling a lot on this, especially since I took on my role at Microsoft as well. And prior to that, even at Google, this was always an interesting discussion. Let's say you are building a new product or leading a new project, if you will, at a larger company. In fact, this also applies to medium-sized companies. I wouldn't say for startups, but medium-sized companies. Usually the narrative in the room when you're discussing this with your team and with your leadership team would be, "Okay, we got to go find product market fit." Absolutely. Yeah. We have to do a bunch of stuff, as we just talked about. Consumer products take time. All of that stuff.

(00:26:57):
But I think there's a question before that question, which is how do you find company product fit? What I define as company product fit. Which is a company essentially is a portfolio of products, and every large company, medium-sized company also has a portfolio. They'll have 10, 20, in some cases hundreds of products in the portfolio. Every company has unique strengths and weaknesses. This is pretty tried, but it's obvious. And I would encourage a lot of folks, when they start embarking on this journey where they're trying to really build out products and so on, is to ask that question. How does that product, assuming it's successful... If it is not successful, it doesn't matter anyway. But assuming it's successful, does it actually serve the right place in a company's product portfolio? Or not? And if it doesn't, don't do it. Why waste time?

(00:27:57):
Oftentimes companies will be like, "I want to do this because some other company is doing it." That is not a good reason. You should only invest in products, or projects for that matter, because you can play to your strengths and you can create some unique consumer, customer value. And by the way, you can do it better than anybody else out there. That's what I mean by company product fit. Take that first step and understand does this even resonate and is it part of the portfolio? Does it make sense?

(00:28:26):
Because if you can answer that question with enough conviction, then your road to the next step on finding product market fit becomes much easier, because you don't have distractions then. Everybody gets it. Everybody gets this is a strategic effort. You have the right sponsorship at the right levels in the company, and you're executing towards it and you're finding it out. Let's say things don't go well. That's okay. People will step in to help. A lot of that will happen, because people innately get it. That this is the right product to go after from a company product fit perspective. That's something that I've been thinking a lot about and also executing as we move forward.

Lenny (00:29:00):
Is there an example of that gone wrong that you can share? Whether it's a company you've worked at or a company you've seen do it badly.

Manik Gupta (00:29:05):
I'll have to think through specific examples, but companies do this all the time, where they do these line extensions. Where they'll say, "Well, we have a lot of traction in a particular segment. Why don't we just go to an adjacent segment? If we just add two more features, suddenly this will be appealing to an adjacent segment." A classic example would be you're doing something for, I don't know, small and medium businesses and you say, "Well, now I just have to add two more features and now I'm going to go up market and I'll get to compete in the enterprise." Or it could be the other way around too, where you have something in the enterprise business and you want to suddenly go down market to SMB.

(00:29:44):
In my view, it's hard. Because again, the capabilities that you need, the thinking that you need, is something you have to really be clear about. This is not to say that it will not fit in the company's portfolio. It's just that when you're making a choice like that, make sure you set it up well to succeed. That's the other part of the equation as well.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Speaking of setting it up to succeed, you also have this idea of a consumer stack concept that I think you've been talking about at Microsoft. Can you talk about what that's all about?

Manik Gupta (00:30:11):
Yeah, sure. One of the things that I'm doing at Microsoft right now is, while I'm working on a lot of the consumer communication products, the other thing that I'm really helping the company think about is how do we get more at scale consumer products built at Microsoft. Part of this is just distilling some of the learnings that I've had over the years. I think there are like five things that I would talk about, which I call the consumer stack, which is essentially a set of capabilities that companies need to have a good chance of success at building a consumer product. Remember, nobody can give a playbook to build a successful consumer product. That does not exist. Because as we were discussing earlier, it's so fickle and so many things have to go right for you to build a successful consumer product. But at least you have a set of capabilities, so you set yourself up the best.

(00:31:01):
The first one I would say is around design-led thinking to delight users. Going back to your days at Airbnb, Lenny, I'm sure this is something that resonates with you. Design for consumer products is such a critical part of how you build the right pull from consumers these days. Poorly designed products have no chance at this point. Your craftsmanship and the design capabilities have to be A plus. And if you don't have that, then you should really invest in that. This is not just about having the best designers. Of course you should. It's just the thinking. It's a attention to detail. It's the attention to how things are pixel to pixel, moving from one screen to another screen and so on. You really have to sweat it out and really be clear in terms of how it's adding value to a consumer. That is, I think, a core capability in these days to build a consumer product. That's number one.

(00:31:54):
Number two is strong focus and prioritization. You can apply strong focus and prioritization to anything in life, but I think it's even more important for consumer products. Because oftentimes people, when they think about solving a problem, they think about coming up with 20 features at the same time, and it's not needed. You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... Firstly your product should have very few features in the beginning. But even if it has those features, it should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused. That's the second one.

(00:32:38):
Most PMs totally understand that. That's their job description, to focus and prioritize. But I feel like a lot of times the PMs do get very confused and distracted, because the number of ideas that people have is so large that they want to just throw everything into the product, and that doesn't work. You have to keep a very high bar for focus and prioritization. That's capability number two.

(00:33:00):
Number three is having the right metrics and instrumentation. This talks to the data aspect of the culture, which is, if you don't have the metric with regards to what you're optimizing for at the initial state of the product, middle state of the product, late stage of the product, you're just not going to choose the right things. How will you measure success? How will you convince yourself, your team, and broader stakeholders that this is actually working or not working? Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, "Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?" And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion. That's number three.

(00:33:59):
Number four is more on the engineering side, which is how do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product.

(00:34:29):
Finally, underpinning all of this is just having strong talent. Assess your talent; your product talent, your design talent, your data talent, your engineering talent, your marketing talent, all these functions. You just have to have a talented pool of people who like to build stuff, and they're the people who understand and have the empathy for consumers.

(00:34:50):
To me, I think these five capabilities... And as a leader, or product leader, or an engineering leader, or anyone who's basically responsible for running products in small company, big company, medium-sized company, it doesn't matter; if you're in the consumer space, my thinking here is that if you look at these five categories and five capabilities, you should really have a report card and say, "Okay. How do I rate these?" If I were to look at my own team, what do I think about design thinking? What do I think about strong focus and prioritization? Are we doing an A job? Are we doing a B job? Are doing a C job or D job? I would argue that if you get to an A job over time, because not everybody will be at A on day one, but if you get that over time, I think you will start seeing results which are very meaningful. That's how I've been thinking about the consumer stack.

Lenny (00:35:34):
Awesome. I was going to ask how you operationalize this. It sounds like it's going to turn into Manik's consumer stack scorecard, and bigger companies can leverage this at their own company and show their manager, "Hey, we're moving really slowly. Maybe this is an area we should focus before we bet big on consumer."

Manik Gupta (00:35:50):
Yeah. I'm trying to operationalize this myself right now in my current job, and I have used some version of this. I mean, this is not something I just came up with. It's something that has been in my mind for a while. I've used it in some shape or form. But during my break, especially before I joined Microsoft, I think this came together for me as something a little bit more tangible that I can use. Then I started applying it, so I think it's been pretty interesting to see.

Lenny (00:36:15):
Awesome. I'm hoping that this proliferates through larger companies and becomes a thing that we can root back to this chat.

(00:36:23):
Shifting a little bit to the CPO role and the VP of product role that you've had at a few companies, in theory this is kind of an end state for a product leader. Every PM, if they stay down the PM career track, they'll become a CPO or VP of product or head of product somewhere. A couple of questions here. One is, do you have a sense of how many PMs actually stay on this track and end up in one of these roles, versus move on to some other role or place?

Manik Gupta (00:36:47):
Yeah. That's a great question. I would say that the percentage for CPO in particular, you having a C title and being a CPO, I think that percentage is still relatively small. This is just my sense. I haven't done the numbers to give you a more accurate picture here, but I think my sense is relatively smaller. Because I think a large part of it depends on how companies are organized. Companies can be organized functionally, companies can be organized through business units, and oftentimes these days it's a mix of both. If you look at any company, they'll have some C level functional executives, but underneath them they'll have GMs. The organization design is just such an evolving field always. And as they say, companies will go one... they'll swing the pendulum one way and they'll say, "Oh, over time it's not working," and then they'll swing the pendulum the other way and then they keep going back and forth. I think the percentage for CPO in particularly in my mind is probably not as big as what people think it is. Like I said, because of the way that companies are organized.

(00:37:50):
I think the interesting thing here is I am just seeing personally, having been a CPO myself and also talking to a lot of people in my network and just observing a bunch of different companies, I think the CPO role is evolving. Or the head of product role is also evolving. I think a lot of it is morphing more into the GM model where you're running not just product management but also perhaps PM and engineering, and design to a certain extent and data science too. You're essentially becoming the overall technical product leader at the company.

(00:38:27):
The reason why I feel that is happening is because it's all about accountability. It's about who has the single threaded leadership model where this person can make all the decisions when it comes to trade offs and running the roadmaps and all of that kind of stuff. It's not ideal, by the way, in all cases. Because what that means is, for somebody to be doing that, that person has to be really, really good at all those other functions too so that everyone who is in their organization respects that. Otherwise people feel like I'm the second class citizen in this model where this person doesn't know anything about, whatever; my function and so on. So it's harder, but I do feel that for optimization around decision making, around having a single threaded leadership and accountability, I feel like that's the direction where the product leadership role itself is going more and more. At least based on my experience.

Lenny (00:39:19):
Is your sense that maybe CPO might fade away as a title and GMs become the common path across companies?

Manik Gupta (00:39:26):
If you were to push me on this, I would say that's probably the direction we will go. I think it's interesting to also think about CTO. If you look at the CTO roles versus SVP of engineering or a VP of engineering, I think it's an interesting debate too, what's happening with CTO roles. If a company is organized purely functionally, I think that's absolutely the right call. But as companies are changing and thinking about how they drive more accountability and more business units and so on, I just feel it probably will become more GM oriented. That does not mean that the VP product is going to go away or the VP engineering is going to go away. I think those roles will still stay. But the C-level title, reporting into the CEO but you're just running that one function; if I look at over time, maybe that role is lot less prevalent than what we have right now.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Do you think that's partly because there's this weird overlap between CPO and CEO, and there's often tension of who's leading the product? Is that something you've seen?

Manik Gupta (00:40:24):
Yeah. I think that's definitely an interesting one as well. I mean, if you think about it, just based on my experience, what does the CPO really do? What is their job description? I think it's useful to think through that. Generally speaking, and again, we can always talk in generalizations because that's how you should think. And every company is unique. But generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans. Like, "Oh, we'll do this, we'll do that," but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision.

(00:41:09):
Then the second big part of a CPO job is execution of the roadmap on the priorities. People sometimes think that, hey, I get to a C-level position. I don't have to worry about execution. Absolutely not. If you're a CPO in particular, even the CTO and the head of engineering, execution matters a lot. The operational excellence. Because things are so complex. I mean, we are in a situation where a lot of people are working remotely, there are all these different tool sets, there are all these different technologies that are coming up, you have different competitors. Execution is super important. And if people don't understand that that's a big part of their job when they get to the senior level, I think they're mistaken. The execution is another one.

(00:41:50):
The third is, for a CPO, especially for a tech company, because you are really driving the product roadmap, it's a very leveraged job. Meaning you have to really work with all your other peers, whether the marketing person, or the sales person, or the business unit person and so on, and just make sure that you are really even deeply connected in terms of what is really needed, so that your product roadmap is how things are going to actually come to life. It's a very cross-functional, on steroids kind of job in that sense.

(00:42:19):
In terms of the CEO, CPO, I think the important thing again is... And this is actually advice I've given to CEOs of some companies as well, when they first start looking for a VP of product or a CPO. This is almost like a questionnaire that I give them. The first question I ask the CEO is, what do you want to do? That's the most important question. Because a lot of times the CEO has either been the technical founder, or they have been the product founder. They can be a sales founder too. All that is fine. But what do you want to spend your time on? Because if you are going to get a CPO or a VP of product and then still want to own the product roadmap and own the execution, then don't do that. Because what is that person going to do? That's the first question that I tend to clarify between a CEO who's looking for a CPO or VP of product.

(00:43:10):
Then the other thing is really about, are you trying to optimize for process? Are you optimizing for strategy? Are you optimizing for team building and attraction? I think that's a really big one. Sometimes you have to get the right level of leader to attract more talent to the team. Because people say, "Oh, this person is working there. Now I want to go work in their organization." How do you think about engineering and data science and design? How do you think about GM and operations? There are a bunch of all these things in terms of the design that you need to do before you decide whether VP of product, CPO is somebody you want to get and what kind of person you want to get.

(00:43:43):
I think that's where the intersection of the work between this... especially for a tech company, the CEO, CPO have to be... And even the CTO I would throw in the mix. That has to be very clearly articulated, otherwise it creates a lot of confusion. Those are some of the things, at least that I observe from different patterns and different companies that I've worked with and also guided and advised, those are things that always come up.

Lenny (00:44:06):
It's interesting how much similarity there is to that experience as there is to the first PM at a company. It feels like they have to have the same conversations with the founder. What do you want to work on? What am I going to take on? How do we avoid stepping on each other's toes the whole time?

Manik Gupta (00:44:21):
That's actually a... I never thought about it that way, Lenny. I think that's a really good point. You're totally right. Obviously, if you're at a bigger company, then you're looking for a VP of product. Or if you're a super big company, then you're looking for a CPO. But you're right. The first product hire that you make as a founder, you'll pretty much have the same conversations to ensure that there are clear swim lanes and accountability for that group.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Interesting. I want to make sure to ask you, as kind of a big deal leader of product at larger companies, I'm curious, what do you look for in PMs that are looking to get promoted, or just deciding somebody's ready for promotion or ready for more responsibility? What do you look for and what should people focus on if they want to come across as promotion material?

Manik Gupta (00:45:01):
I'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish. Because they're a package. And if you just look at one versus the other, then I think you end up making a mistake. Usually. On the what, I think the what is usually more objective. What I look for... And again, it depends on the level of the person. Don't try to calibrate someone based early in their career. You have to think through that. That they're in learning phase. If they're more senior than you have to of course calibrate them differently. But ultimately, if I were to boil it down on the what, it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them. They may not have come up with the hypothesis. That's fine. Somebody else could have come up with it, it doesn't matter. But they believed in it, they rallied the team behind it, they drove towards it and created impact.

(00:45:58):
The impact not necessarily always has to be positive. It could also be a lot of stuff that we learned, but we learned from it and then we moved on and we did the next rev. By the time we did the next rev, we were smarter about it. Clear demonstrated impact from an end to end product cycle to me is probably one of the better indicators of readiness for someone to take on more. And you basically want to give them more, because now they have a pattern of doing things properly. That's one.

(00:46:23):
On the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity. Think of the flip side. PMs who don't create clarity is such a time sink and the teams struggle so much. I'm sure all of us, when we think about back in the day, maybe we were in that position at some point. But we also worked with folks who were always confused and didn't really summarize, or didn't really follow up, or didn't really create that level of clarity in terms of what we need to do and so on, and how broken that felt. People who can create the clarity and then have the energy around them to get things done, I think that's the how in my opinion. Which is really important for determining somebody's career trajectory.

(00:47:11):
Then the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them? Do people at some point, as they go up and become more senior, do people want to work for them? Ultimately people make choices. And if you have a bunch of smart people and they're making smart choices and they're choosing this person to follow or to be with and work with them and reach out to them, and you keep hearing things about, hey, so and so wants to work with this person because this person is amazing; there is a ton of value in that.

(00:47:45):
Those are the three things that, if I were to really boil it down, not looking at a certain level, I think I always look for those attributes.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Those are awesome. So simple and clear and succinct. I like the way that you framed it as followership versus leadership. There's a lot of PM attributes leadership, and there's something really nice about just a way to understand that as how many people are following you and excited to work on the things that you're trying to get them to work on. That's very cool.

(00:48:11):
Along the same lines, when you think about PMs that had an inflection point in their career, do you find that there's anything correlated with something that leads to a large inflection in the progress of someone's career where they all of a sudden started doing incredibly better?

Manik Gupta (00:48:24):
I've gone through a few inflection points myself, and almost always they've happened because something in the organization changed, so I got a shot. There's always that luck factor, going back to the first question that we discussed.

(00:48:37):
But generally speaking, I think the inflection points happen in two places. One is when someone has really successfully changed the dynamic, or the trajectory rather, of a particular product. That's a huge inflection point. That doesn't happen very often, to be fair. But when it happens, you know it. You know, as a leader, this person worked on this and they actually led this change and now we are playing a different game. We are playing a bigger game, we are playing a different game, all of that kind of stuff.

(00:49:16):
In other words, what I'm saying is the inflection point for a career is correlated strongly with the inflection point in the product. If you can connect those, the cause and effect... If there's causality and not just correlation, if there's causality in that, I think that absolutely means that you've got a winner. And you really want to bet on them and you have to give them a lot more to do, because they have the ability to do it. That's one.

## Transcript

Nikita Miller (00:00):
And many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal, and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much.

Lenny (00:52):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Nikita Miller. A huge thank you to Camille Ricketts for recommending Nikita and for connecting us. Nikita is senior vice president and head of product at The Knot Worldwide. Before that, she was VP of product at Dooly, and before that she was head of growth and retention at Trello for over five years. In our conversation, we dig into how product managers and people getting married are similar, a bunch of advice on getting into product management, a really cool framework for how to align roles and responsibilities within your cross-functional teams, a bunch of advice for working effectively as a remote and distributed team, and the one question that Nikita asks constantly to get the most out of her teams. Nikita is amazing and I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Nikita Miller after a short word from our sponsors.

(01:51):
This episode is brought to you by wealth fronts. Anyone paying attention to the stock market over the past few years knows it's been a wild ride. Many people who made risky stock bets during the bull market are now facing big losses and wondering how to make better informed investments going forward. That's why I'm excited to tell you about Wealthfront's new stock investing product, which is specifically designed to help you make better stock investments. It has all the features you'd expect, including fractional share, zero commissions and $1 minimum. But what sets it apart is a unique feature called Stock Collections. These are groups of stocks created by Wealthfront's investment team that are designed around unique investment opportunities. You can think of Wealthfront Stock Collections like Spotify Discovery Playlists, but instead of helping you find new songs, they help you discover new companies and themes to invest in.

(02:38):
For example, some popular collections right now are dividend to blue chip stocks, semiconductor leaders, and rising interest rates, and each collection includes a summary of the opportunity and trade-offs to help you make more intelligent investing decisions. To start investing with just $1, visit wealthfront.com/lenny. And note, I'm a Wealthfront client and they arranged for me to share this product with you. Important disclosures and details can be found in the show notes. Are you hiring, or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand curated people who are open to new opportunities.

(03:21):
Thousands of people apply to join this collective, and I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a new opportunity, actively or passively, join the collective. It's free, you can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave anytime and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. Nikita, welcome to the podcast.

Nikita Miller (03:59):
Hey, Lenny. Thank you. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (04:02):
I'm excited to have you. So I don't know if you know this, but I'm actually having a kid in a couple months and I've been doing a lot of reading, as you do when you're going to be a parent. And I was reading a lot of stuff on The Bump, which turns out I realized was something that it was in your umbrella of products.

Nikita Miller (04:15):
It a part of The Knot Worldwide. Yeah.

Lenny (04:17):
And then I realized y'all have that for pregnancy, you have a site to help you with proposals, you have a site for obviously wedding planning and vendors and just party planning in general. And so is the general strategy to be there for every adulting milestone in life? Is that the plan?

Nikita Miller (04:34):
Yes. That's a nice way of putting it. We talk about it as being there for the big celebrations in life. We have these celebratory moments that mark adulthood, and so to be part of that journey, we primarily focus in the wedding space but yes, across the whole journey.

Lenny (04:52):
It feels like the two pieces you're missing are divorce and funerals. Is that the plan or do you want to stick to happy things?

Nikita Miller (05:00):
I think we're sticking to celebrations. I think we're leaning on the world needs a lot more celebration right now, so helping folks do that.

Lenny (05:07):
You're here. Okay, cool. It's a really smart strategy. It makes a lot of sense, once you get someone with their wedding and then they expand from there.

Nikita Miller (05:15):
And their friends too.

Lenny (05:18):
Interesting, right, because they register on The Knot and they'll know what's going on there.

Nikita Miller (05:22):
That's right. You register.

Lenny (05:24):
Genius. So we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned along your time there, but I wanted to start with your previous gig at Atlassian and specifically leading growth and retention at Trello. Many people listening to this podcast either use Trello and love Trello or are thinking about using Trello, and so I thought it'd be interesting to hear just who do you find Trello is the most ideal for? When is it good and smart to go with Trello versus Jira or Linear or Asana or something like that?

Nikita Miller (05:53):
A few things. So I think Trello initially started out as being the task management or planning tool for anyone as opposed to the others you just mentioned, which tend to be in software in our industry, and that's who we're geared towards. Trello when it first started was very much on being simplicity of design, being easy to use, tactile, easy to onboard. You don't need customization, you can use it in single-player mode or multi-player mode. And so that meant that at the beginning, we got a lot of people using the product that were small businesses, that were families, that were people planning their weddings potentially. 

(06:32):
And then over time, as our users became more sophisticated or had more problems to solve, that's how I think we evolved and grew with them. So some of it's around this concept of progressive disclosure where you start with a small problem and as it gets more sophisticated, Trello grows with you, whereas I think some of the other products, they start with complexity and if you want something simpler, you kind of have to pull things away or tease things apart. And that was definitely something that helps Trello stand out. I think now, many years later, you'll find that Trello is very fully featured and fully powered and they now lean into that a lot more, but that wasn't always the case.

Lenny (07:14):
So it sounds like Trello broadly was meant for a lot more than just software teams building product?

Nikita Miller (07:18):
Yes. It started off I think being inspired by software teams and wanting to understand how to move and manage tasks easily. That was the origin story, but then very quickly became the kind of tool that anyone could use to manage anything. And now I think we're back more the product is way more towards the software development and that's a lot more of the competitive advantage, but I think the people that are excited about Trello and the ones that made Trello really impactful weren't necessarily software.

Lenny (07:50):
Got it. When you think back to your time helping grow and retain folks on Trello, is there a big win or something you're really proud of that you think back to that was a huge success in that time to help Trello grow more or be more successful?

Nikita Miller (08:07):
That's probably not what you'd guess. So when I started Trello, I actually joined to build out Trello's enterprise business. And so a lot of our growth and retention was actually about how to get more teams into the product and then spreading it throughout the org, so not only software teams but sales teams or marketing teams. And so the big push there was around collaboration. How do you create a shared perspective for everyone working on a project, not just a software team?

(08:38):
So we had a good time thinking through what's the customer experience, but obviously in the context of enterprise, which for Trello at the time was really tricky because it's such a customer first product, I think shifting our mindset to understand enterprise and teams specifically as a cohort was very different. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that or the team did a good job of that, and I think being a part now of the Atlassian suite definitely leaned into that even more.

Lenny (09:09):
Was there a specific feature that unlocked a lot of opportunity or is it just broadly, there's a bunch of little things you have to add?

Nikita Miller (09:15):
I think it was broadly a bunch of little things. So all the enterprise features that you can imagine that all products need to operate at the enterprise level, smaller features around labels like how do you color them? How do you name them, when do they appear? When you invite people, do you invite individuals or do you invite teams? So a lot of the work was around going from single player or two, three player mode to 5, 10, 20 people.

Lenny (09:41):
Got it. Coming back to the question of Trello versus Jira, because I think this might be interesting to people. Just if you're trying to decide should we use Trello or should we use Jira, what's a simple way to think about which way to go as a founder maybe or as a product team?

Nikita Miller (09:55):
I think that smaller teams, especially folks that are ideating, when you haven't landed on what you're going to build yet, I think Trello's a great product for that. For pulling ideas, for prioritizing them, for tracking how we're progressing through discovery, I think Trello's really great for that. For things that have been decided and are ready to go and are really in the breakdown these tasks and assign it to people, then something like Jira is probably a better use case, but I'm sure there people that'll disagree with that.

Lenny (10:29):
Cool. Building for PMs is what you were doing while you were working in Trello. I imagine that's kind of a bittersweet experience. I imagine in some sense they're an amazing market to sell to, on the other they're probably really annoying. What's a surprise maybe or a lesson about working on building products for product managers?

Nikita Miller (10:46):
I think you're right, it is a bitter sweet place to be. I think I less thought of it as building for product managers and just thought about it in the context of productivity overall. And productivity software in itself is really what's bittersweet because there are a lot of trade-offs and when you're dealing with a software team, for instance, how you measure productivity or define it for a PM or a designer or engineer and a data scientist is probably really different. And so the impossibility of solving for all of those use cases I think is always what's challenging, and we know that no one product is actually going to solve all of those use cases, no matter what the marketing taglines are out there.

(11:29):
And so it was really challenging to figure out what are the core things that a product manager might need to see or a designer or a developer, and how do you make sure that that core is there? So you get the 80% and then you spend time on the 20% that you know a very small segment of users are going to use, but they're probably your core, so maybe you spend some time there. But the answer is no one's going to be happy, and with Trello in particular it was challenging because for a while we built a product that was easy to use for everyone, and so then trying to really narrow in on well, what is a software development use case and what do we really need for that? And that might be very different from what a mom-and-pop shop is going to need or someone planning their wedding is going to need.

Lenny (12:15):
That's a good segue to something else I wanted to ask about. You used to build for product managers and now you build for people getting married. I'm curious what is similar about those two groups and what's maybe most different?

Nikita Miller (12:26):
A lot of similarity. So folks planning their weddings, think of it as an emotional, high stakes thing that you're hopefully going to do once, and so the pressure is really there. The pressure and expectations are really high, not unlike product managers or other folks in software, and ultimately wedding planning is this huge project where you have a bunch of stakeholders, friends, family. You need to manage multiple vendors, and the time horizon for a wedding once you're engaged is anywhere from 12 to 18 months, so it is a longtime project. I think there's a lot of similarities there. 

(13:06):
Some of the things that are a little bit different in terms of how we're building the product is the amount of decisions probably that need that go into wedding planning are far more than you'd imagine. So one of the reasons being at the Knot is so interesting is we go all the way from planning tools, so actively, how do you help people find inspiration and plan their wedding day-to-day to two-sided marketplace. We have our e-commerce business that's supposed to be registry and paper and obviously our affiliate businesses and the ads businesses, so it's a little bit different from a SaaS productivity tool, the business that we're in, but a lot of the problems that we're solving for users are actually really simpler.

Lenny (13:48):
Which one's more, I don't know, stress inducing.

Nikita Miller (13:51):
That's a great question. I think that couples, it's such an emotional thing for people, for individuals and their families and their friends, so I personally feel like I empathize with that in a way that I don't do the same for product even though I'm a product manager, because there are many projects and there're always things that we need to manage and that's just part of the gig. Whereas planning your wedding, for couples this is for many the most meaningful time of their lives, and everyone does this differently. So we have folks that are planning their multi-hundred person weddings and then there are 10, 15 closest friends weddings, but the emotional side of it is the same and you don't want to let them down because most aren't going to do it again.

Lenny (14:38):
Yeah, okay. That's what I would've guessed. It feels like wedding couples are more stressed. I just had an idea. I imagine you think about this. We're doing a baby shower right now and it feels like you're missing a opportunity to do the baby shower invite platform.

Nikita Miller (14:51):
Yes, we've thought about it.

Lenny (14:54):
And also registry, a registry platform.

Nikita Miller (14:56):
Yes, also that.

Lenny (14:59):
Okay, okay. So many opportunities.

Nikita Miller (15:00):
All the life moments.

Lenny (15:01):
Oh my God. One last question about Trello. Do you have any just tips for someone using Trello and may not be aware of something they could do with  Trello?

Nikita Miller (15:09):
I think the biggest that people probably know about but are often underutilized are Power-Ups, which is basically our integrations. And Power-ups are folks that are usually doing things that are more complex, often. But Trello, when you think about it with other products like Asana, as you mentioned, Linear, some of what people are worried about is that it's just not powerful enough, and Power-Ups are a way to do that. And there are dozens and hundreds of integrations that you can use it for. So that's worth checking out.

Lenny (15:39):
Awesome. Great tip. Shifting a little bit and zooming out, you've worked at a lot of different companies at a lot of different levels, also a lot of different geographies and I want to chat about that last piece. But maybe just broadly, what are a few of your biggest lessons about building successful and impactful teams?

Nikita Miller (15:59):
This is kind of my jam.

Lenny (16:01):
Excellent.

Nikita Miller (16:02):
It's kind of what I spend a lot of time thinking about, and I think every company go into you approach it slightly differently. For me, it usually starts with individuals identifying very clearly early on roles and responsibilities, like what are the expectations of a role? So in software, for most of us one of the things that I think I've seen done well or contributed to and multiple companies is the triad, product, design, engineering, data. And what does it look like for these roles and data science that's like other?

Lenny (16:38):
I see you put data in there.

Nikita Miller (16:42):
I'm trying pull that in. That is my mission. I love that. My mission is product, design, engineering, data.

Lenny (16:47):
It's not a triad anymore though, but I love it.

Nikita Miller (16:50):
I know. It's a quartet something.

Lenny (16:50):
It's just a chair.

Nikita Miller (16:53):
It's a chair. Great. So I think about that a lot. What are the roles? What do you expect for each of them and how do you define the responsibilities that we have to each other? I know it sounds maybe on the softer side, but I think a lot of what we can solve for in creating strong teams is exactly that. The exercise that I often do is I generally have an idea of what I think the roles and responsibilities are and the expectations across these four roles, but the exercise especially with leaders in an org is to have them sit down and write them for each other.

(17:29):
So Atlassian has some of this that they do in the form of playbooks, but it's basically I as a product leader, I'm going to write down what I think the expectations and the role and responsibilities of my engineering manager, of my designer, of my data. And then we look at it together and then we arrive at essentially a contract with one another about what we think that looks like and what that responsibility is to our teams, and from there, we cascade it throughout the org. This is very time-intensive, as you can imagine, and often leads to a lot of debate because depending on the kind of orgs or people's backgrounds, our expectations might differ, but I think that contract early on is really important.

Lenny (18:08):
This is super interesting and I want to go two levels deeper. Is there a template that you have? Is there specific questions you're answering? Is it freeform? How do you actually know what to write in one of these?

Nikita Miller (18:21):
There is a template. There are templates we can probably share after this-

Lenny (18:24):
Awesome. Great.

Nikita Miller (18:25):
... to run the roles and responsibilities, and it usually comes in a couple of forms. It's what the expectations as an IC? What's the expectation as a manager or with your team? And then what is it to each other and what are the things that are shared? So when we're running an experiment, a product manager's likely to write a product brief and go into the details of what that means. The data scientist is likely to help write the actual experiment brief, but we're all putting inputs into it. But then when it comes to data and analysis, my expectation is that both of you are doing that together.

Lenny (19:01):
And is the idea the PM writes, "Here's what I'm planning to do," is it the data scientist writes on behalf of the pm, "Here's what I expect you to do?" Who's taking the charge in each of these?

Nikita Miller (19:11):
You write your own. So I as a product manager, I write what I think my role is and also what I think what my expectations of my counterparts are and they do the same, and then we review it together.

Lenny (19:23):
And you encourage every team within your domain to do this amongst themselves. 

Nikita Miller (19:28):
Yes. 

Lenny (19:29):
That is very cool. If there's an example you could share that we could put in the show notes or a template, that would be great.

Nikita Miller (19:35):
Yeah. We'll do that.

Lenny (19:36):
What have you found as impact that comes from doing this a before and after? What kind of difference do you see having done this on team?

Nikita Miller (19:45):
So I'd say recently, I'd say in the past maybe five years, one of the things that has shifted and has caught some people by surprise, I don't know if it should or not, is around project management. So I think 10, 12 years ago, everyone expected that they would have Scrum Masters, and Scrum Masters have largely in many companies just disappeared. But then you think well, where did that responsibility go, because someone has to do project management? And this is different from program management internal to a team. 

(20:18):
And from my perspective, a lot of that now sits with engineering managers, which is a little bit different from how it was when I started in product where actually, a lot of that was put on PMs. And some of you might recall, it caused a lot of issues with product managers because they were the ones that were constantly like, "What's happening in the sprints? What didn't make it? Why didn't it?" Doing a lot of that work. And I think PMs are still responsible to keep track of that, but engineering managers are increasingly expected to be the ones that are actively making sure that sprint goals, for instance, are met. And that's a shift that I've seen recently that we do have to debate often.

Lenny (20:57):
I think one of the most interesting elements of this approach is that the product manager role is so I ill-defined and so different in every company, and so I imagine much of the benefit here is just what the hell is the PM's responsibility?

Nikita Miller (20:57):
100%.

Lenny (21:10):
Is there anything that you find is surprising about what teams end up taking off the PM's plate or putting on the plate that maybe other companies don't?

Nikita Miller (21:18):
I think a lot of people end up putting a lot on the PM's plate because of that misunderstanding. And so you end up looking at something as a group and saying, "Well, no one human can do all of those things all the time, so let's talk about what the shared responsibility looks like." And what I think is really powerful about the triad is that it's a recognition of there are shared responsibilities. Who's responsible for making sure that everyone understands what we're doing and why, the PM leads that, but evangelizing that is something that would be expected of designers and engineering managers and data scientists as well.

Lenny (21:57):
On the data scientist piece, you talked about how you're trying to embed that more and more into product teams. At Airbnb, data scientists were embedded in every team, so I totally get that.

Nikita Miller (22:05):
It's not everywhere.

Lenny (22:07):
Yeah, exactly. What more can you share there of just why you found that to be important and how you're approaching that?

Nikita Miller (22:13):
From my experience as a product manager, it was always a blocker. Getting your hands on the data, maybe having someone to troubleshoot with if as a PM you couldn't kind of understand or figure it out yourself, it was just always a blocker. And so then you'd also then have to go and negotiate with other teams about getting someone's resources to look at this problem, so that's one. The other is just that data scientists, as with most humans, we get better the more focused we are and the more in depth we are in understanding the product itself. So if you have someone that's dedicated to a zone or an area of the product, then it's much easier for them to spot patterns as opposed to attempting to understand what's happening every time a ticket comes in.

Lenny (22:58):
And so the shift you push for is instead of a centralized data team that you convince to give you resources, you embed the data scientist into the team.

Nikita Miller (22:58):
Right.

Lenny (23:07):
And do you call them data scientists, do you call them analysts? How do you think about that?

Nikita Miller (23:11):
That also varies per company. That depends on the organization and the work. Some teams require data scientists, not all. Some require analysts, so that just depends on what the team's working on, what's needed.

Lenny (23:27):
Got it. Coming back to the roles and responsibilities framework, do you encourage teams to revisit that every once in a while or is it like this team's done this thing and we're good for a while?

Nikita Miller (23:36):
I encourage them to revisit it and it's usually because something's fallen off the rails. I think if they were really great at it, I'd say every three months or every six months, let's have a look and see how this is going. But often it happens because there's some conflict or tension or something was missed and someone thought it was theirs or not and we have to do a quick retro.

Lenny (23:59):
What do you find is often that thing that is maybe missed or often causes tension?

Nikita Miller (24:04):
Execution. It's usually around execution and velocity.

Lenny (24:10):
Not moving fast enough?

Nikita Miller (24:11):
Not moving fast enough.

Lenny (24:13):
What do you find often is a way to help with that as a leader of teams?

Nikita Miller (24:18):
Well, one, just identifying what the velocity issue is. It can vary, so for PMs it's often around the velocity of decision-making. How long does it take us actually from saying we need to do a thing to defining it potentially, and then deciding are we actually going to do it or how? And that I think takes a long time for most companies, most people. So velocity of decision-making, so I think that tends to fall on the PM most often. The actual execution of it, the development tends to fall on both PM and engineering. So in engineering I find that depending on the org, some folks understand breaking up tickets into small pieces and why that's valuable and how to do it, and that's something that I think everyone in industry probably needs a refresher on, why that's valuable and how it works. And some of that is also shared by the PM because if you haven't articulated clearly or well enough what we're trying to do, then it is hard to break that apart. So those are the two things that are on my mind a lot.

Lenny (25:27):
Is there anything else along the lines of what you've learned about building successful teams? I really love this roles and responsibilities approach.

Nikita Miller (25:35):
Outcomes and output also comes up a lot, and many of the companies that I've either worked with or advised, coached over the past few years, it was all about outcomes. Everyone was, "Outcomes, outcomes, outcomes," which is right. You want to make sure you're doing the right thing with the right goal and that's fine. And some folks, myself included at certain points, swung way too far on the outcomes train and forgot that output is an indicator of that. 

(26:10):
So if you have a team that's doing all of the ideation and figuring out how to make decisions quickly and getting the right documentation and setting up the right product briefs and design briefs and experiment briefs, all the things that we know go into to successful product development, that's great, but if you're also not shipping a lot of things to market quickly enough, then it just doesn't matter that much. So that conversation is one that I think we often have to revisit on all the teams I've ever been on that yes, outcomes are important, but also the indicator is around execution and velocity. So if that's not in line, then a lot of the other things don't matter that much.

Lenny (26:50):
And so when you say outcome, you're saying here's the goal they're achieving or the impact they're having, or is it just the idea we know what our outcome will be but they're not actually shipping anything? When you say output and outcome, what are you referring to specifically?

Nikita Miller (27:04):
The outcomes are understanding what the goals are and what we might do to get there. So OKRs is one way to talk about that. Great. But embedded in that is and how are we going to get there? And the fact is, the more tries you have at it, the likelier you are to get it right. So we're not actively monitoring how fast does it take us to ship things to market.

Lenny (27:28):
I see. So if I can rephrase it, a lot of teams know and talk about what they should be doing. They have a strategy, they have a goal, but what you're finding is that there's just not a lot of action a lot of times and there's a huge opportunity just to get a team to actually ship more often and move faster.

Nikita Miller (27:46):
Yeah. There's not a lot of understanding of our role and urgency. It's urgent, and software in particular. You probably can't forget that because someone else is likely doing something similar or better and faster.

Lenny (28:02):
Makes me think of I think Frank Slootman is his name, the Snowflake CEO. He wrote this book called Amp It Up, where he talks about how to build thriving software companies and businesses in general. One of his three most important recommendations is always have urgency, to never let off the gas of urgency. That things always need to feel urgent.

Nikita Miller (28:22):
I'll check that out. But I think product managers, I consider product to be the ones that really need to drive urgency.

Lenny (28:33):
Say more about that. What have you found helps in creating that sense of urgency and continuing to increase output?

Nikita Miller (28:39):
Mostly reminding people often. And I don't think that's a question of, "Well, show me list of everything you ship. That's never going to work." Well, that doesn't make people feel good about the work that they're doing, but let's talk about our experimentation backlog. What do we have in there? How quickly are we getting those things out? Those are the kind of conversations that I think help. I think that having a good pulse on competition helps as just a friendly reminder that there are others out there doing this and thinking about things very similarly, possibly, to how we're thinking about it, so how do we differentiate ourselves? And a lot of that is about how quickly are we getting many ideas to market? Small tangent. The competition side is interesting to me because I've worked at a few companies where I've worked with founders who are like, "We don't have competition, we're the only ones doing this," and then fast forward a few years and you're like, "Here are all the companies that were your competition that you didn't recognize then that are shipping great product now."

# The art of product management | Shreyas Doshi (Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo)

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:03):
There's no one out there today who shares more wisdom, more consistently on the art of product management than Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas came out of nowhere a few years ago and started tweeting gems of insight about building product and the role of product management, and rightfully so, has built a huge following on Twitter. What I love about Shreyas is that his insights are often framed in really memorable and interesting ways and they're often contrarian and not ideas that you've heard elsewhere. Shreyas has worked at some of today's most important tech companies, including Yahoo, Twitter, Google, and most recently Stripe, both as an IC and a manager. And his advice is always rooted in his real life experiences at these companies.

(00:00:48):
In our chat, we focus on five topics and go deep on them. We talk about the power of pre-mortems. We talk about how to best use your time as a product manager. We look into the three levels of product work and how getting them wrong often leads to tension on your team. We dig into why most execution problems are really strategy problems. And we talk about a common pitfall in prioritization. And if you listen to the end, we actually throw in a bonus topic. I really appreciate that Shreyas made the time for our chat and I cannot wait for you to hear it.

(00:03:42):
Shreyas, the man, the myth, the legend, thank you so much for joining me and for having this conversation.

Shreyas Doshi (00:03:48):
It's great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny (00:03:49):
So we strategized about how to make this podcast as concretely useful and actionable for as many people as possible. And so, we decided to do is instead of a regular interview where we talk about a lot of stuff, instead we're going to go deep on five of your ideas, teachings, lessons that you've shared on Twitter that have stuck with me, and I know have resonated with a lot of other people and we're going to call it the five big ideas from Shreyas Doshi. Does that sound about right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:04:14):
Sounds great.

Lenny (00:04:15):
Okay, cool. So before we get into that, before we get into the meat of all this stuff, you share a lot of wisdom on Twitter, but you don't share a ton of about yourself and your background, where you grew up, where you're born and things like that. So I'd love to learn a little bit more about the human that is Shreyas. And so, maybe we start there, where were you born, where'd you grow up, what'd your parents do for work, what did you want to be when you grew up?

Shreyas Doshi (00:04:36):
So I was born in Mumbai, Bombay, India, and I lived there for the first 21 years of my life. I actually did not really even get to see many parts of India while I grew up in India and basically just was in Mumbai the whole time. And then I moved here to the United States for graduate studies at age 21. My parents, my father was a businessman, and so, he started his own business. He manufactured spices and marketed them. So growing up, I saw him work on packaging and pricing. And when he was short on staff, I used to be packaging the spices into the little box or creating some marketing material for him, not the creative part, but the grunt work. So I grew up in that environment where the lines between what was my dad's business and our personal lives were very blurred.

(00:05:32):
My mother just growing up as a homemaker, and so, my dad was largely just busy and all consumed in his business. And I ended up spending a lot of time growing up with my mother. And so, both of them have had a pretty significant influence in different ways, but both significant influence on who I am. When I grew up, I changed that a lot. I think when I was very young, one of my uncle is a doctor, so I saw him and I was like, "Oh, maybe I should be a doctor." And at some point later, I changed that. In high school, I took French and I ended up being really good at it, surprisingly good at it, and I was very passionate about it.

(00:06:10):
So for a while, I was thinking, "Oh, I'll maybe teach French after graduate from college. Maybe I'll go to France, learn the language a little more. And maybe I'll teach French." That lasted for a few years and turned out that I ended up not pursuing that, and instead, got a degree in computer engineering. Partly, I think because in India back then, if you were good at science and mathematics, you would usually take up engineering. And so, that's what I ended up doing. I was also quite passionate about computers, so maybe that was part of it. But once I started on that path, it became much clearer what I wanted to do.

Lenny (00:06:50):
How's your French these days?

Shreyas Doshi (00:06:51):
Very bad. Sad to say, my son is now taking French and I am just embarrassed at my inability to assist him in any way, other than to point out some conjugation errors.

Lenny (00:07:04):
So you said you studied computer engineering, that's what you moved to the US for, how did you move from that to product?

Shreyas Doshi (00:07:11):
So, I started my career as an engineer, or well, backtracking, so I completed my undergrad in India, came here to the United States to pursue a PhD in computer science. About one month in, I realized that PhD in academia wasn't for me, so I decided that I was going to drop out of the PhD program. And once I dropped out, this was like 2001, 2002 so the climate was very different, there were basically no jobs for tech people. Certainly there were no jobs for people who required a visa, which I did. So it was very difficult, but I ended up working as an engineer at a couple of startups and that started my career in tech. I was an engineer for about four or five years. And when I moved here to the San Francisco Bay Area, I got a little taste of product management.

(00:08:00):
So, I was part of this team that used to be Loudcloud, and they were acquired by a larger company EDS at that time, so it was a startup team within a larger organization. And I was an engineer there and I just started doing some product work. And I found that my managers over the time would send me to customer meetings. We had an internal product, so these were internal customers. And I thought it was a little surprising because I was fairly junior and I was an engineer, but I was like, "Okay, I'll just go to the customer meetings." And I really enjoyed that. I really enjoyed understanding what our customers were trying to do, helping them out. I also enjoyed thinking about creative ways to solve their needs and whatnot. So, that was my taste of product management.

(00:08:40):
For about a year, I was doing the product job without having the title and I was also the engineer. So I was in this great state where I'd figure out what needed to be built and I would just build it myself. So, that's how I started. And at some point during that one year, I realized that while I was a good engineer, I was perhaps a top 20% engineer. I realized that I would never be a great engineer, that I would never be a top 10% engineer because I saw those engineers, the fortune of working with them, and I just could tell that I couldn't be that. And I increasingly got interested in this product thing, so I said, "Okay, let's try out this product thing." And so, that's really what started my product career. And I think what I have to be really thankful and grateful for there is the people who gave me a chance to do the product work and there were many people involved. And so, I think without their support, it would've been much harder for me to become a product manager.

Lenny (00:09:34):
I didn't know that you moved from engineering to product and your journey is very similar to mine where I was also an engineer. And once I got to Airbnb, I was like, "Okay, I am not good. And I will not last as an engineer at a company like this. And I should think about what other options exist." And it worked out great. And so, I wonder how often that happens of PMs moving into PM because they aren't going to make it as an engineer.

Shreyas Doshi (00:09:57):
I think it might be a common occurrence because engineering is a really great job, particularly on empowered teams, as an engineer, you can do a lot. You don't have to just write code, but you can do a lot. And so, I also think it's a great place for people to start their career if they have a technical background and if they enjoy the part about building software. Because sometimes people will ask me, "Hey, I'm doing this technical degree, whether it's computer science or something else, but I want my first job to be product management." And I often respond with, "Tryout engineering because, again, in many companies, fortunately these days you can do a lot more than just the core engineering job. And so you get exposure to many different things. And once you do that, you can decide what path to pick."

Lenny (00:10:44):
It's such a bonus to have that background as a PM. I wanted to go back, so you mentioned that you worked at Loudcloud. I had no idea. That was Marc Andreessen's second company, right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:10:53):
Yes. I joined that team. Again, this was a time when there were very scared jobs in the valley and I was interviewing with them for nine months or something like that, and they had just been acquired by EDS. So they split into two companies. One got acquired by EDS and the other became Opsware, which was the product company. And so, I joined the Loudcloud part of that organization.

Lenny (00:11:17):
Got it. Is there something that you took away from that company? Was Marc Andreessen still working there? And I think Ben Horowitz also.

Shreyas Doshi (00:11:24):
Yeah, they were still there, they were working on the Opsware side. Again, because even though I was hired as an engineer, the non-engineer task I was given was to manage a relationship with Opsware because the way that split worked is EDS would use Opswares data center automation technology, and my team was responsible for deploying and supporting that technology for EDS. And so, I was given this role of managing the vendor relationship and I have no idea. I'm in my early 20s, I have no idea how to manage vendor relationships, but I ended up doing that.

(00:11:59):
And as part of that, I got an opportunity to work with many folks over at Opsware, including folks on the leadership team there. And that was my first experience of what a really highly talented and energetic team looks like, both on the Opsware side, like I said, I worked with a number of people there, but also on the former Loudcloud side who were my team members. And that magic, a very high caliber team, people who really great at their job and brought high degree of energy and collaboration to their work. I was just lucky to have been part of that team early on.

Lenny (00:12:32):
And then following that, you worked at a bunch of really important well run successful companies, Stripe, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, what's one thing you took away from each of these companies that you've worked at that has stuck with you? You share a lot of this on Twitter, but if you just think about somebody took away from each of these companies or even the founders that ran these companies, what might those be?

Shreyas Doshi (00:12:53):
Yeah, let's do this rapid fire style because you know me, I could spend an hour just talking about this topic. But just starting with Yahoo, I think I learned the importance of building multiple services under a single account. I think that was the one Yahoo ID was such a powerful thing. It wasn't easy to pull off back in the day and Yahoo was perhaps the first company that pulled it off really well. And so, that idea of bundling under a single account, which then Google really did extremely well later on was something that I got to experience very first hand because I was working on the identity team at Yahoo. Google taught me the.

Lenny (00:13:33):
Real quick on Yahoo because it makes me think about it. I remember they tried to do that with Flickr and they had a bunch of trouble with that, people on Flickr didn't want to log in with Yahoo, is that right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:13:42):
Yes. That's the story of every acquisition that are some raving fans of the service that are perhaps not entirely happy about their beloved service being acquired by a large company. In fact, we encountered this at Google as well. If you remember YouTube accounts used to be separate from Google accounts or Gmail accounts. And at some point, Google decided that you should be able to use your Google account to log into YouTube, and also over time, that everybody who uses YouTube should have a Google account. So they went through a multi-year migration of accounts, and they had similar backlash. The interesting part though, is nobody remembers that now, people happily use YouTube. So this is one of those things where sometimes it's painful in the short-term, even though it might actually be the right answer over the long-term.

Lenny (00:14:36):
Great advice. Okay. Sorry I cut you off. Google.

Shreyas Doshi (00:14:38):
Yes. Google, I think the main thing I learned was the power of thinking really big. And I know it sounds like a platitude, but really big. And I only actually realized that when I left Google and I started working with the other teams and these were all capable teams and I was struck by how many teams just limited the potential of what they could achieve. And I think Google helped people think big by default. And so, I think the six years I spent at Google really helped me understand that really well and just make it a normal part of how I operated. So that was really useful for me.

Lenny (00:15:18):
Is there an example at Google that some of you worked on that was like, "Holy shit. This was going to be big or let's think bigger about this"?

Shreyas Doshi (00:15:25):
Well, as with anything, there's pluses and minuses. So I worked on the ads team at Google for a number of years and there was this unwritten rule of thumb that, hey, if it's not going to generate more than $100 million in revenue, it's not worth talking about it. Because the ads business was growing so fast and was so large that we would regularly not pursue opportunities that were just quote $100 million. So why do that? That's because Google had access to billion dollar opportunities for it as business. So they were very clear on pursuing the big opportunities. And in some cases, these opportunities were not obvious, so we had to create those opportunities. If you think about some of the innovations Google brought over the years in monetization, including things like video ads and whatnot, those were not obvious opportunities, but Google decided that it wanted to pursue those big opportunities.

(00:16:22):
And in order to do that, it had to sometimes just let go of these seemingly smaller opportunities. So that tendency to think about, well, yes, there is $10 million business here, but can we make it $100 million business? Or there is a $1 million business here, can we make it a $10 million business? What does it take to make it bigger is a habit, I think, that got ingrained for me at Google. Now, of course, there's the other side of it, which is, I think, Google missed out on some trends simply because of this filter or this high bar where sometimes it's not clear if something is $100 million opportunity or $1 billion opportunity. So that is a downside of this. What I mainly took away is for instance, even at Stripe, when I joined, I was just thinking a lot bigger about the business. I was responsible for Stripe Connect and that helped us make different decisions about what to prioritize and at what pace to go after it. So, that was Google.

(00:17:21):
Moving on to Twitter. I think at Twitter, the main thing that struck me with all the challenges, they had infrastructure challenges and also some challenges around leadership and culture is just the stickiness that comes with combining network effects with core product differentiation, because Twitter had both. We talk about network effects all the time and I don't have much more interesting things to add beyond what's already added. But this combination of core product differentiation, because if you think about it, there's still no product like Twitter, despite now being a long time since the product was launched. And that core product differentiation combined with network effects has what enabled Twitter to have the staying power it's had. And I think unless something terrible happens, I think Twitter will be around for a really long time. So, that's something I got to observe very closely when I worked at Twitter.

(00:18:13):
And then at Stripe, I think the main thing I took away was that when you combine high energy sound judgment, low ego and small teams, you just get magic. And so, Stripe wasn't by any means flawless, but I saw that combination of high energy sound judgment, low ego and small teams more at Stripe than any other place I've been at. And so, that was very impactful and my growth and thinking as a leader. And I can go on with the founders, because I know you had asked that question.

Lenny (00:18:45):
Let's do it.

Shreyas Doshi (00:18:46):
Okay. With regards to the founders and what I learned from the founders, Yahoo, I didn't work much with the founders. At Google, I had some interactions. I was in meetings with Larry, Sergey, Eric Schmidt. And I think particularly if I were to pick one thing, I really appreciated Larry's strategic insight and particularly his ability to simulate the future to make better decisions. And so Twitter, I just overlapped very briefly with Jack's comeback as CEO back when he came back. And I think I was struck by his ability to listen and ask great questions in a few meetings that I was with him. And so, I was really impressed like he would just listen a lot more than you would expect, say, the CEO to listen. And then he would just ask one vital question and that's something I've tried to use in my leadership style ever since I saw that.

Lenny (00:19:38):
Is there an example of that or a story of that happening that you think about?

Shreyas Doshi (00:19:42):
I forget the details and they're not that important anyway. But there was a time when we were discussing a potential acquisition and I was on the fence on that acquisition, it would be something that my team would acquire, Jack was in the room. And I remember we went through as is common in many corporate settings. We went through all the pros and cons and all the intellectual arguments and the strategic arguments and the metrics arguments and all of that. And Jack was just listening through all of that. And then I remember very distinctly, he asked me one question which was something to the effect of, how does this make our users love Twitter more? Simple question. But then at that point I realized, yeah, we never really talked about that because we were so engrossed in all the other stuff. And we talked about it as a proxy because we were talking about metrics and impact and integration and those sorts of things.

(00:20:40):
So I still remember that. I still remember him asking a simple question. Frankly at the time I did not have a good answer to that question. So that was a lesson for me to get more rigorous about my own thinking.

Lenny (00:20:52):
That's a question that a lot of PMs would hear and be like, "Oh my God. Come on, man. We're trying to move some metrics here." But I love that you took that as like, okay, I really find this really important. And this is a really important question to think about and as a lesson of how to approach this kind of stuff. So I love that. I think you were going to talk about Stripe too, right?

Shreyas Doshi (00:21:08):
Yes. Stripe, I worked a lot with Patrick and John. John was my manager for a while. And from John, I learned a lot about marketing. John is a master marketer. Among many other things that he's absolutely great at, he's just a great marketer. And I just learned a lot about how to think about talking about the product in terms that, again, obvious stuff, but talking about product in terms that customers really understand. And then sometimes emphasizing things that we as product people might not think are really important, because maybe we didn't spend much time on building it, and we want to talk about things that we spent a lot of time that are truly innovative, etc., etc. And John would often make, again, these observations about, well, if we just talked about the product in this manner, that will likely resonate a lot more with customers.

(00:22:00):
And that got me thinking a lot about how I need to reframe my approach to basically separate the effort involved in building something with the effort you want to put behind talking about said thing. And that doesn't have to be the same features that you talk about. So, that's something I learned a lot working with John. From Patrick, I think the main thing I learned was just how to think and communicate more clearly. Patrick did that extremely well. And then overall from both, I learned the importance of setting the culture you want, simply by consistently being an example of the behaviors you want to replicate in the organization. So instead of talking about values, I saw both of them just live the values that they wanted the company to replicate, especially as the company was scaling. So, whether it's a culture of being user centric or it's a value around humility, they just lived those values so consistently. And I think that consistency spoke louder than anything that you might write on a poster on the office walls.

Lenny (00:23:08):
It's just hearing you describe all these companies and all these founders that you've worked with, it's pretty incredible to set of experiences that you've had and the primordial soup in which you became a PM. And it explains a lot about how you're able to squeeze so much wisdom and insights about the role of product management and the art and skill of product management, because you've seen so many ways of doing it and so many companies that have done in different ways. And so, it's a good segue to shifting to talk about the five big ideas. The first is around this concept of pre-mortems, this is something that stuck with me when you tweeted it. I think it was a couple years ago at this point and I see it come up occasionally in your tweets and amongst people chatting your super follower threads. And so, I also like that there's something you can actually implement and act on pretty quickly and see impact. And so, curious to hear your thoughts on this idea of pre-mortem just unpack this idea for folks.

Shreyas Doshi (00:23:58):
We're all familiar with a post-mortem or as they call it in the military, I think, after action reviews. So every company I've worked at, we've had some form of post-mortem when a launch had problems or an initiative did not go as planned or we suffered an unacceptable system downtime. Somebody would say, "Oh, we need to post-mortem that." And over the years, I really saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem. Some really great insights came out of a post-mortem about what went wrong and what we could have done better. And as I saw the effectiveness of a post-mortem, that's what made me wonder, why do we need to wait until after things go wrong? Because why can't we extract some of these insights before they go wrong? And it was around that time that I discovered the idea of a pre-mortem. I learned about it from an Harvard business review article written by Gary Cline.

(00:24:50):
And the idea is simple, which is when you are working on an important project or initiative, you get together with your team early on in the products or the projects' life to see in advance what could go wrong. And the way I describe a pre-mortem is that if you do a pre-mortem right, you will not have to do an ugly post-mortem. You might still do a post-mortem to learn, but odds are very high that it is not going to be a bad post-mortem. And the genius of the pre-mortem ritual is the initial prompt. So it's not just about like, well, what could go wrong? The initial prompt is the genius, which is the prompt starts with, imagine this project that we are working on has failed six months from now, or this launch we are doing has miserably failed. Let's just all imagine that. Now, let's work backwards from there and ask ourselves what went wrong, what could have contributed to this utter failure.

(00:25:47):
And that's how a pre-mortem meeting will start. The leader will start with this prompt. And then the way the meeting goes is you ask your team members to share what could have caused this utter failure, and the magic of this type of approach where you work backwards from a failed outcome. A hypothetical failed outcome is that it just somehow enables two things. One is much greater psychological safety for team members to talk about things they're concerned about, but that they were just hesitant to bring up because nobody likes to be negative in modern organizations, everybody wants to be optimistic and positive. So a pre-mortem setting gives everybody the license to actually think about what can go wrong. So, that psychological safety is a big, big factor in why a pre-mortem works.

(00:26:40):
And what I've found is at Stripe, I did this regularly with launches that my team was involved in. Sometimes some teams or some people were just surprised or skeptical like, how is it really going to work? And then we go through the pre-mortem meeting and there's a whole process that we can talk about. But as we complete the meeting, I ask everybody, so how did that go? And just everybody is smiling, even though we've spent say 30 minutes or an hour, just talking about terrible scenarios of things that could go wrong, but everybody's feeling a little lighter because its great catharsis for them. So that becomes really important.

(00:27:14):
And the last kind of thing I found with pre-mortems now that I've done them with various other companies as well, that I advise and whatnot is the shared vocabulary and the shared vocabulary that you get about being able to talk about things that will fail. So I have a specific approach, which is I ask the team to talk about three things. Each member on the team should bring up three things. One is a tiger. So you can bring up tigers in the shared doc that we create. And a tiger is a threat that will actually kill us, just like a tiger would. So these are actual problematic things that could be really harmful to the product or the project. So, that's a tiger.

(00:27:51):
The other is paper tiger. So this is a seeming threat that others might be worried about, but you're not worried about. So that's the paper tiger. And then the last one, and I think this one was also used at Airbnb in other ways is elephant. And the elephant in the room that nobody is talking about. So it might not be a tiger, it won't kill us, but you're still worried that we are not seeing reality as it is that. And so, an elephant could be like, well, we are assuming that just because we launch this and do a bunch of PR that we'll get users, but are we sure we're going to get users? That's the elephant in the room that nobody is talking about that, again, this gives you that psychological safety to bring it up.

(00:28:28):
And then what I noticed as I ran pre-mortems is that in future meetings that the team had where I wasn't even present, people started talking about, "Oh, I have this tiger. Can I bring up this tiger?" And all of a sudden it became okay for people to bring those things up, which I think is perhaps the best part about a pre-mortem is that shared vocabulary.

Lenny (00:28:45):
Such a simple idea that is clearly going to benefit you and your team. And it's interesting that people don't often do this, or haven't even thought about doing this. And so, just to get a little bit deeper, how do you actually execute this meeting? Who do you invite? What are the questions you ask? When exactly do you do this, that kind of stuff?

Shreyas Doshi (00:29:02):
And so, as I started doing pre-mortem, they got more and more popular at Stripe, other teams started doing them, and then afterwards I helped some startups also do pre-mortems. And at some point, I decided I should just write down my template for pre-mortems. So I worked with the folks at Coda to create a Coda doc, which you can find, and we can put in the show notes if possible, basically that's an entire template for how to run pre-mortems using this method that I talked about, including tigers, paper tigers, elephants, all of that. The main thing about a pre-mortem is to include people from every function that is going to be involved in, say, if you're doing a launch. And so, if it's a really large launch, sometimes I will separate it into two groups. One is everything related to the engineering side of things. Usually the engineering team is fairly large, so you can bring in every engineer. So, that's really important. Every engineer needs to be in the meeting, and so, it might be a meeting of 10, 15, 20, whatever engineers, and maybe a PM, maybe a design counterpart, and so on.

(00:30:07):
That's just focused on the product engineering side of things like what could go wrong. And then again, for a large launch, I like doing a separate pre-mortem for the go-to-market side. And so that will involve sales team, support team, marketing team, involve design team. Some of the core engineering leads will also need to be at that meeting. Over there, we'll talk about more of the go-to-market risks. So that's what I like to do for a very large launch.

(00:30:35):
For a smaller launch, I just like to do one meeting where everybody is present. And like I said, start with the prompt of, imagine this has failed. So as the pre-mortem meeting leader, it's my responsibility to share the prompt. And then I like doing these pre-mortems where we alternate between speaking and quiet time. So I'll share the prompt and then I'll say, okay, now the next five minutes or the next 10 minutes is quiet time where I already have that template, like the quarter doc where people start entering their own tigers and paper tigers, and elephants in a way that nobody else sees. And so, people do that, and then we go around the room and share.

(00:31:11):
And the one other innovation I added as I did this often was also, after people shared, I ask people to pick the tiger that they find more scary, but that somebody else mentioned, so not their own tiger, but some other tiger that somebody else mentioned that they found more scary. So, that ends up being people basically are voting. And then as the pre-mortem leader, it's my responsibility to take all of that output that the team has generated in this document and then prioritize. Because again, the point is not to solve every problem, the point is to identify threats that we are not talking about openly or that we might just be missing, or we might be assuming that somebody else is going to deal with it only to find nobody was thinking about it. So then I like to create a pre-mortem action plan and then share that with the team and keep myself as the leader accountable for actually making progress on it.

Lenny (00:32:04):
Having started doing this, have you noticed a less need for post-mortems, basically projects failing less than having less problems? What impact have you seen executing on this idea?

Shreyas Doshi (00:32:13):
Absolutely, I've seen us identify certain issues that just wouldn't have come up and likely you can't really run a simulation and see what that actually looked like in real life. But those likely would have resulted in a problematic situation afterwards. A great example is sometimes you'll see a company announce something and they have massive backlash. And then one reasonable observer might say, "Well, how did this company miss this?" because what happens is they have the backlash, then the company realizes, "Oh, we have this backlash." Then they start doing damage control. They sometimes might even backtrack and undo whatever they did. They'll say, "Sorry, we didn't think about these issues. Give us some more time and we'll come back, and we'll perhaps relaunch the feature, but in a better way."

(00:33:00):
To the casual observer, it may seem like that it should have been obvious and sometimes it's not, but oftentimes I agree, it should be obvious to these teams what issues these things are going to cause. In fact, it is obvious to some team members, but the problem is that they perhaps haven't created that psychological safety and that vocabulary to be able to talk about it in an objective way and to decide with intent, are we going to solve for this or not? So I do see a lot of those scenarios in our industry, which end up just actually wasting a lot of time. Whereas pre-mortem is a very inexpensive way to see these things because all it is is one meeting followed by some work that the leader needs to do to prioritize, followed by some mitigating actions, which you would've had to take anyway. So that's why I'm a huge fan of pre-mortems is, it's one of those very low downside, but very high upside things that I've experienced.

Lenny (00:33:54):
I'm excited to see those template, I haven't seen yet. I don't know that you put one together, so that's awesome. And we'll link it in the notes of this episode. I want to move to our second big idea, which is about something you've called LNO framework, which is all around prioritizing your finite time as a PM and as a team. And so, I'll just kind of turn that over to you to share what that's all about.

Shreyas Doshi (00:34:15):
Yes. And so, I'm going to share a short personal anecdote related to the LNO framework, which is that when I just joined Google as a relatively new PM, this is back in 2008, for the first three years, I was overwhelmed and stressed. And that was because, one, I was a new PM in this really high performance environment. I was working on some important products and launches and I just had too much to do. And I looked back at that time and it was perhaps the most stressful time of my career, where I would long hours, etc. But even at the end of the day, I'd feel highly dissatisfied because my to-do list was endless and I wasn't able to make a dent on it, and I was also a little bit of a perfectionist, so I was like, "No, no, no, I need to do this well."

(00:35:02):
It was just constantly I would come home and talk to my wife and basically just complained to her about how I'm not able to make progress or as much progress as I want, then that was accompanied with not being able to sleep very well because I was concerned about how much output I was producing and whatnot. And so, again, very stressful time in my career. And then things changed when I discovered the ideas related to this LNO framework in a block post. Unfortunately, I can't even find that block post somewhere, but it had some ideas that I took and then created this LNO framework on myself, which is essentially that as a product manager or as anybody in a creative high impact high leverage role, all your tasks are not created equal, there are actually three type of tasks that you end up doing in such a role.

(00:35:56):
So there are L tasks which are leverage tasks. And the L tasks are such that when you put in a certain amount of effort, you get 10X or 100X in return in terms of impact. So those are L task, leverage tasks. Then there are neutral tasks, so that's N. And those are tasks where you basically get what you put in, or just a little more than that. So you put in 1X and you get 1.1 X, those are neutral tasks. And then there are overhead tasks where, again, in terms of impact, you get back a lot less than you actually put in. And it turns out that many people who are ambitious or are perfectionists like myself by default treat each of these types of tasks the same way, and therein lies the problem. So this was the epiphany for me back at Google when I discovered some of these ideas.

(00:36:47):
And what I realized is that among the things in my to-do list that are actually only very few L tasks, and so, it made sense for me to focus a lot on those L tasks, to take on those L tasks when I was feeling most productive, most energetic during a certain time of the day.And for the L tasks, let my inner perfectionist shine because I'm going to get so much more in return. It makes sense for me to spend that time on that PRD, for instance, related to an important feature that will meaningfully impact our revenue. I'm going to spend more time on that than I ordinarily would. So now, where does that more time come from because it cannot come from just working more hours? Well, it comes from spending less time on N tasks and O tasks. And so, there are some tasks that you do. Classic example of an O task is say an expense report. Sounds silly, but I used to try to make my expense report really good.

(00:37:47):
And sometimes that made no sense like, "No, no, no. I need to do that." And again, this is the silliest example, but there are many examples. And something I realized is that the same type of activity can actually be either an L task or an N task or an O task. So what's an example? So say a classic PM task activity of filing a bug report. And so, many companies have these bug templates, etc., etc. that you use to file a bug report. Well, it turns out that filing a bug report depending on the situation, depending on what type of bug it is can actually be an L task high leverage task, and over there you want to file a very detailed explicit bug report. And in other cases, might actually be an O task where you don't fill out the template that diligently and you don't add 15 screenshots with annotations, instead, you just have one screenshot and you hit submit on the bug report.

(00:38:43):
So that shift. Usually for the same type of activity, we provide the same type of engagement. The last example I'll use to illustrate this is taking notes. It turns out even taking notes, taking notes synthesizing them, and then sharing them can actually be an L task, an N task or an O task, depending on what type of notes they are. So, after I understood this, previously, I would just send all notes. I tried to make them really good, which took a lot of time. But then I realized, well, this is a meeting where, yes, I need to send notes, but again, it's like, it's just standard stuff, I just need to quickly list out. People need to really know is the three action items that came out of the meetings who owns them, that's it.

(00:39:23):
And it is not about something highly strategic or controversial. Well, in that case, I'm just going to send the notes out the moment the meeting is over, I'm just going to hit send because I've already taken the action item. I'm not going to try to make my notes look great so that others can appreciate, "Oh, Shreyas always sends great notes." On the other hand, if it was a product review with the CEO about a very contentious topic that you have gone back and forth multiple times, and now you made a decision about something, you want to perfect those notes before you send them out, you want to get the language right, you want to be very clear on what the decision is, so there's no room for misinterpretation, so you don't backtrack afterwards or people say, "Well, but I thought we'd said this." That's a case where it's an L task. And I would say just spend an hour or even two hours perfecting those notes because it's an L task. So, hopefully that helps illustrate some of the ideas behind the LNO framework.

Lenny (00:40:18):
Yeah. And that last piece is a really good segue to the next big idea around optics and the important optics.

(00:40:25):
This episode is brought to you by Sprigg. If you've been a member of my community for a while, you know my user fan and investor in Sprigg. Sprigg is a user research platform that makes getting user insights from your product as easy and fast as getting analytics. The best product and research teams at companies like Loom, Opendoor and Dropbox use Spriggs in product surveys to target specific users, start collecting insights and identify issues and opportunities related to activation, onboarding, engagement [inaudible 00:40:54]. Talk about a platform that pays for itself. But I'm perhaps most excited about Sprigg's newest launch, which extends the power of the platform pre-launch and makes it possible to test mockups and prototypes with your own users in minutes.

(00:41:06):
The testing interface is super slick and doesn't require any of the typical plugins that make testing with your own users an appealing. And with unlimited seats, you're able to invite anyone from your company to view and use insights generated by Sprigg. If you want to get started, head over to sprigg.com/lenny and mention that I sent.

(00:41:26):
But before we get to that, I wanted to have one follow-up question. What are some classic examples of high leverage tasks that PM should try to do more often and think about? What's in that bucket, generally? Even though you pointed out a lot of times they could be in any of the buckets, depending on how you execute them. Are there things that are just like, you should probably spend a lot of your time doing X, Y, Z?

Shreyas Doshi (00:41:43):
Yeah. So, turns out that the L tasks, PMs implicitly just deep down they know what their L tasks are, because those are the tasks that are bothering them the most because they are not doing them or because they're not doing them as well as they know they should. So, the classic example of this is the case where a PM will say, "I know I need to work on getting our strategy right, but I don't have time because I'm busy firefighting. I'm busy just dealing with all these execution issues. And I just don't have time to work on the strategy piece." Sometimes we console ourselves by saying, "Yeah. That's because we have all these things going on this month, but trust me, next month, we're going to have ample time and I'm going to just spend a whole week working on strategy." Well, the next month rolls around and it's the same thing, you've got other issues.

(00:42:38):
The reason we procrastinate on these tasks are, one, because we know that they're L tasks, we know the impact they'll have, and we are a little scared. That's one. The second is they require dedicated attention. And again, we are afraid about whether we'll have anything interesting to say. That's the deep fear. Why many people procrastinate on strategy? Because deep down, they don't know if they can formulate a good strategy. So time becomes a convenient excuse for us where we say, "Well, it's not me. It's just, I don't have time to work on it." And by the way, everything I say here, I have been that person. So I have been that person who's procrastinated on an L task, whether it's the strategy or whether it's writing the PRD for this really difficult feature, or it is working on aligning two teams where that alignment would create a lot of impact, but it's hard, it's an L task, but I don't do it because I don't want to deal with this other person, this manager I love to collaborate with to make it happen.

(00:43:46):
And perhaps, I don't know if we'll get along. I don't know if I can have that tough conversation. And so again, it's an L task, but I'll try to apply bandaids instead of just tackling it head on. So, this is tough stuff. And what I've found useful there is two things, two tactics make a huge difference in helping us target L tasks better. One is the idea of placebo productivity. So, what I do is before I have to tackle an L task, that couple of days leading up to it, I do all these placebo productivity tasks. Basically, I intentionally do N tasks and O tasks. I fill up my day with N and O tasks.

(00:44:26):
And I keep reminding myself, "Yeah, you're just doing neutral and overhead tasks." Because then that just tricks me into thinking, "Okay, if I've been doing this placebo productivity task for the last two days, now, it's the right time for me to do this L task." So that's one tactic. The other is change of location. Nothing, for me, at least fights my procrastination for L tasks better than changing the place from which I'm working. So if I normally work from this desk, the appointed day I did my couple of days of placebo productivity tasks, and on that appointed day, when I'm slated to do an L task, I will actually go out and work from somewhere else, whether it's a coffee shop or a co-working space or some other space. And I find that change of place just forces a focus and a shift in mindset that helps me bang out that L task very quickly and do it really well.

Lenny (00:45:16):
That are some great advice. There's so many layers of advice in that answer. Your point about the high leverage tasks being the task that you know you should do, but don't want to do, makes me think of a quote that I always come back to that the cave you fear contains the treasure that you seek. And I often find that to be true. And it's this reminder to just wherever the compass is pointing where it's most difficult, it's probably where the biggest opportunity lies. And so, that's a really good reminder of all that.

Shreyas Doshi (00:45:40):
So wise. Yeah, pay attention to your fears because they're telling you something.

Lenny (00:45:44):
Speaking of fears, our third big idea is around the three levels of product work. Basically the three things that a PM should be focused on and how often when you're not aligned on what is most important to you and your team, it often leads to conflict. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack this idea of these three levels of product. We can all share what they are impact, execution and optics. And when I saw this for the first time, I always come back to these three things, because it's so simple and so accurate. And so, I'm excited for you to unpack all this.

Shreyas Doshi (00:46:12):
This idea that there are three levels of product work, impact, execution, and optics. Once you understand it, it explains a lot of what you see on product teams and organizations in general. And so, perhaps start with an example that most product people, product leaders and founders are used to seeing, and something I've seen dozens of times in my career that there's a product review, say, where you as a PM are presenting to the CEO. And as you're presenting what the plan is, obviously since this is a real world product, there's going to be some compromises that you're taking. And so, the CEO perhaps asks about, "Okay, well, why is our customer service response time going to be so high in this case?" And you've thought about it, it's like you did not think about that issue, but that is a good reason why. You talk to the VP of customer support and they don't have the funding this quarter to support your product fully, which will then result in a poor customer service experience for this kind of new product that you're launching.

(00:47:16):
But then you've agreed. You've used your skills of influence to agree that, okay, next quarter, they're going to allocate a lot more people to your product so that the customer service experience will get better next quarter. And so, the CEO asks, "Why is the customer service experience going to be poor here? Or they make a remark like that." And then you reply with all these good reasons. Again, good reasons. And needless to say the rest of the product review doesn't go as well. And after the product review, you wonder what happened. Maybe you ask your manager what happened and particularly you're wondering why couldn't the CEO see a very rational argument about why you can't do this at launch.

Lenny (00:47:57):
Never happened to me. Never happened.

Shreyas Doshi (00:47:58):
And so, it's like, why doesn't he or she see that? And the reason is that you are thinking at different levels. So you as a PM perhaps are fixated as you are dealing with this launch or this project, you are fixated on the execution level, which is what does it take to get something done? And how can I do it? How can I hit the next milestone? Those are all the things we tend to think about when we are thinking at the execution level. The CEO on the other hand is approaching it from the impact level. And particularly perhaps in this case, what is the impact to the customer experience? And often CEOs are the ones, or founders are the ones that are thinking about, what is the impact to our brand? And so the CEO is thinking at the impact level, you're thinking at the execution level, there is that mismatch.

(00:48:46):
We litigate the minutiae of whatever issue we are discussing, but we never really recognize that it's because we are default thinking at different levels. And so, this realization helped me better understand why there were conflicts between two very smart and well intentioned people or groups within a company. I was myself guilty of this as well earlier on in my career, time and again, I noticed that we can, again, keep litigating the specific issue without understanding that, "Oh no, there's actually just a fundamental mismatch." And it's not like people are stuck at one level and can never think at a different level, it's just that we tend to default to certain levels, and that's like sometimes our preferred level. We can switch levels, but that requires a nudge sometimes. And so, that observation helped explain a lot of things, including what kind of people an organization will promote? Does it promote people who default operate at the impact level? Does it promote people more who default operate at the execution level or at the optics level? So, it has very wide ranging impacts on just overall how an organization functions.

Lenny (00:49:59):
What's an example of optics? And when optics matters, when you might not be thinking about the importance of that? Just impacting that one a little bit.

Shreyas Doshi (00:50:06):
Yes. So, optics is about creating awareness of the impact and the execution that you're doing or your team is doing. That is the most compact definition I can come up with for optics. And optics is a good thing. So I'm not saying don't think about optics whatsoever, I think it's actually important to think about optics. And now I'm talking about just internal optics. External optics is an entirely different thing and that's like marketing PR and that's definitely highly important. But even when we talk about simply we limit scope to internal optics, I'll make the observation that you should be spending some time on internal optics because it creates energy, it creates awareness, it creates excitement, it creates opportunities for feedback. Those are all really great things and they will enable greater impact and better execution for you.

(00:50:57):
The challenge with optics is that in certain organizations that balance gets thrown off, where optics sometimes becomes the goal where somehow implicitly the organization or its culture has indicated to it's people that as long as you do the optics well, you are going to be fine, you are going to be appreciated here, you're going to be rewarded here as long as you do the optics fine.

(00:51:22):
And it's not like the organization woke up in the morning and said, 'This is the culture we want to create." It just happens again through little actions that occur every day, it happens through who you hire, who you fire, who you promote and what kinds of things do you appreciate at all hands as the CEO or the founder. Do you appreciate a launch? Do you appreciate results? Do you appreciate, I don't know, an awesome status update that somebody sent? So a status update doesn't on its own accomplish anything. I mean, they are important, but a status update is an optics activity. Now, it is a necessary optics activity, but if you start appreciating the necessary optics activities, constantly, the signal you are sending to people is, 'Oh, you got to focus on this optics activity." So then, that becomes the goal and that can be really harmful.

Lenny (00:52:09):
So there's these three levels of product work. Do you have advice for, should I just default to one of these normally based on just as a PM, I should always be thinking about impact or is it more, just make sure you're aligned with your leader with your team? Is that the more important takeaway?

Shreyas Doshi (00:52:23):
Yes. I think that's the more important takeaway is again, it's about now we have a vocabulary that we can talk about in an objective manner without pointing fingers. It's like, 'Oh, you tend to be fixated on all these execution details and that's not the right thing." That's the type of feedback sometimes that gets shared. So now you have vocabulary to talk about this and once you have that, you can, as a team, decide what is most important given your context. I'll give you an example. For early stage teams, of course, they need to be thinking about the eventual impact, but what they should actually, I think, most early stage teams should actually optimize for execution. Assuming that they have come up with a reasonable hypothesis about what's going to win, their main emphasis needs to be on execution because you will not see impact readily on a one week horizon or a one month horizon or perhaps even on a quarterly horizon.

(00:53:20):
So that's an example of a situation where let's be explicit, we need to get great at execution. We have a set of core insights that were informed by our desire to make an impact. But now that we are responsible for converting these insights into a product, let's be largely operating at the execution level, as an example. Say there is a platform team and that platform team has had some issues lately with availability that has disrupted some other teams within the company and their products. Perhaps that platform team should have a conversation that, 'You know what, yes, we need to focus on impact obviously to avoid this negative impact, but also let's pay some more attention to optics because we haven't been communicating with teams as much teams that rely on us. So let's create a better communication channel with them. Let's create better status updates for them," and whatnot. So again, the point is not so much like, "Oh, this is the right level and all other levels are wrong," it's about being sensitive to what's right in this situation.

Lenny (00:54:21):
So you talked about execution and how maybe for early stage startups that might be default the most important type of work to be focused on. And that's actually a really good lead way to our fourth big idea, which is a provocative tweet that you put out a while ago that you said, "The most execution problems are actually strategy problems or culture problems." And so, I'm excited to hear a little bit more about how you discovered that and what that means and maybe how to address those problems.

Shreyas Doshi (00:54:49):
And so, I realized this somewhat late in my career as a leader, most execution problems that I encounter in a high performing environment where everybody has the right intentions are actually not execution problems, they are either strategy problems or interpersonal problems or cultural problems. And so, just to illustrate it, I'll make the observation that many leaders are extremely busy in such environments, whether it's a fast growth startup or a fast growth larger company, they're extremely busy, they're usually overwhelmed. Like I said earlier, I was one of those people. Take a deeper look at what they're engaged in. And I got a chance to look at it with my peers that I was mentoring or coaching or people on my team, PMs or PM leaders were extremely busy and usually overwhelmed.

(00:55:36):
I noticed two things, that what made them busy is two things. One is that somehow the organization had imposed very high optics requirements. So they had to do a lot of optics related work, show up at certain status meetings and blah, blah, blah. So we talked about that. So let's leave that aside. But the other reason they're so overwhelmed is that they're constantly solving execution problems. So they solve the most important ones, the new ones come up and they solve those. And then there are two new ones to solve and on and on, it's a classic guacamole. And as I noticed that, and I'll share a concrete example of where this might happen, where an execution, a seemingly execution problem surfaces, so say two teams are misaligned. They need to work together where they're misaligned. Everybody knows it. And that is affecting our execution. That misalignment is affecting our execution. It's affecting our ability to hit our OKRs, it's affecting their ability to hit their OKRs.

(00:56:32):
So as a leader or say, you are a director of product or VP of product responsible for one of these teams, you now charge with fixing this execution problem so we can move faster. So you do a dozen meetings to figure out what's going on, you try to diagnose the issue, how to better align. And then you talk to your peers on the other side, and then you decide, "Okay, here's what we're going to do to solve this execution problem. We are going to create a new review process." And so, we are going to create this process and we are going to review priorities on a regular basis across these two teams. And then we are going to also as the managers of these individual teams to do regular one-on-ones so they can stay in sync. So this type of scenario is extremely common, again, especially in high growth organizations that want to accomplish a lot.

(00:57:19):
You'll come up with this solution after many meetings and a lot of work, a lot of conversation. And so, as I grew as a leader, I got increasingly curious about this type of situation. And when I looked at it more closely, I started realizing that what looked like an execution problem, this misalignment and this causing execution issues wasn't usually an execution problem. Instead, it was a strategy problem in some cases, because the reason we are misaligned is because we are pursuing different strategies or that is more often the cases, the reason we are misaligned is because we don't know what the strategy is. So, we don't know what the strategy is. We craft some OKRs based on what makes sense. The OKRs are not very well aligned. We don't have a sense of priorities, and we also don't have a sense of what we do when reality changes.

(00:58:09):
This is all stuff that a clear correct strategy should help inform. But actually this lack of strategy is what's causing this misalignment, it's not because they're not meeting regularly. And what happens in these meetings is, again, you're arguing the minutiae of like, "Well, are you going to work on this feature? I depend on this. Or can you swap two engineers from this team?" All of this stuff that PMs are very familiar with. You're talking about all the small stuff, but nobody recognizes that like, "Can we fix that?" So, as I started seeing this often was a strategy problem, sometimes it was not a strategy problem, it was a culture problem. So, what is a culture problem in this situation where two teams are misaligned?

(00:58:49):
It's basically that you have a problem where you have set a culture that you are supposed to mainly optimize for your OKRs. In a culture like that, it becomes really hard to allow two teams to work better together because if one of the teams doesn't hit their OKRs, because they were helping rightly for the sake of the company, they were helping this other team that team's manager is going to get his or her wrist lap at the next performance review.

# How to grow a subscription business | Yuriy Timen (Grammarly, Canva, Airtable)

## Transcript

Yuriy Timen (00:00:00):
The only thing that's worse than a channel or a tactic that you tried not working. The only thing that's worse now is when you didn't give it the appropriate shot, right? And you prematurely were erroneously concluded that it doesn't work and it's remarkable how often you find that to be the case when I talk to companies, "Oh, YouTube, we tried it. It doesn't work." I'm like, "Okay, can I see what you've tried?" And then you look at it and you're like, "Oh, this thing was not designed to even have a shot at working from the get go."

Lenny (00:00:40):
Yuriy Timen is a full-time advisor to companies looking to figure out their growth strategy. He's worked with companies like Canva, Airtable, Otter, Whimsical, Hims, Flow Health, and a dozen others. I know a number of founders who have worked with Yuriy and they all tell me that he transformed how they think about their growth. Before becoming an advisor, he spent nine years at Grammarly where he led growth in marketing and helped turn that into the household name that it is today.

Lenny (00:01:07):
In our chat, we get incredibly tactical about all of the ways that you can grow your product, including when and how to invest in virality, SEO, and paid growth. What's changing across each of those channels and the most common failure modes for B2C startups. This is the most tactical and actionable conversation I have had yet on how to grow your product, particularly a subscription product. And I'm really excited for you to hear it. With that I bring you Yuriy Timen.

Lenny (00:01:36):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flat File. How many B2B SAS companies would you estimate B to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:01:44):
At least 40%?

Lenny (00:01:46):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:01:49):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chalk full of unexpected data and formatting they'll leave.

Lenny (00:02:08):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup, conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:02:23):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (00:03:50):
Yuriy, welcome to the podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:52):
Thanks for having me man. This is great.

Lenny (00:03:55):
It's even better for me.

Yuriy Timen (00:03:57):
All right.

Lenny (00:03:58):
So I'm going to give a quick bio. Let me know if I missed anything really important. You were head of growth at Grammarly. You spent nine years there kind of doing all the things that helped turn that company into the killer product that it is today. You left that I think a couple years ago. Now you're advising companies mostly full-time. I think mostly on growth strategy. I think mostly consumer startups, is that about right?

Yuriy Timen (00:04:21):
A couple of super critical corrections. Number one, it was only eight and a half years.

Lenny (00:04:26):
Okay. Usually people round those up. I'm impressed that you get-

Yuriy Timen (00:04:31):
I think eight and a half is long enough. Yeah, not sure I want to round up. I know, but I'm kidding obviously. Yeah. That's largely it. Grammarly was a hell of a run and trying to take a step back from that, and stepping back has kind of taken on a life of its own vis a vis advising.

Lenny (00:04:54):
How many companies have you worked with at this point advised and what are some examples, just like companies people would know.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:01):
It's now been about, I guess two years and three months since my last day at Grammarly in an operating capacity. I've probably worked with maybe 15 companies in the last two and a little bit of years. Obviously, not all at once. It's usually four to five at any given point in time. But some of the ones that I've been really lucked out with in terms of getting aligned with companies like Canva, Airtable, Hims and Hers in the personal care space, there is otter.ai. Who else? Flow Health, the world's most downloaded period tracker.

Lenny (00:05:47):
I used that for my wife. It's handy.

Yuriy Timen (00:05:49):
Good, good. Yeah. I was trying to get my wife to try it out, but been unsuccessful.

Lenny (00:05:59):
You're failing in your growth.

Yuriy Timen (00:06:01):
She was like, "Are you trying to push me to having a third kid?" I was like, "No, no, I swear." This is just product testing.

Lenny (00:06:08):
Clever. So I've had Casey Winters on this podcast and Elena Verna. It's kind of like the three of you that it feels like have worked with the most companies as advisors. I don't know if there's some kind of contest y'all have or anything, but do you think about that at all? Is there anyone else out there that you think is in the running?

Yuriy Timen (00:06:26):
First of all, just being mentioned the same breath as those two is an accolade in and of itself. I mean, I look up to both of them. They've gone first. Also, I credit a lot of my getting started to both of them because they've been very generous with their time when I was just kind of considering advising, especially Casey, if they listen to this. Huge shine out to both of them, but Casey especially. He's such immense when it comes to just being generous with his time. So no, there is no competition, but had there been one, I suspect I'd be in lead right now because I've done it. I've done it in a shorter period of time. I'm much newer to advising than both of those, but no, I have a ton of aberration respect both of them. They're phenomenal what they do and I learned a ton from them.

Lenny (00:07:24):
I love that acceleration is fastest. Wow, sweet. So we're going to talk a lot about consumer growth strategies and your experience working with companies and a bunch of insights on things you've learned from working with companies. Before we get there just one quick question in your advising. I'm curious how many companies do you work with at once normally?

Yuriy Timen (00:07:43):
Yeah, so I play around with different quantities. So a couple of things. So you mentioned, you alluded to earlier that I advise full time. What I'll say is that mostly the only thing that I do right now professionally is advising, but it's not quite full time. I hard count my week at about three to three and a half days a week worth of work, which is a personal choice. And so that is a hard constraint that I'm working with. And within that constraint, I also feel like for me to do my best work and the work that I also enjoy the most and find the most fulfilling four to five companies is probably the max. If I try to go beyond that, the overhead that it creates in terms of the cost of context switching just becomes overwhelming. I feel like I'm not showing up as best as I can with each individual company.

Lenny (00:08:43):
As early plug or anti plug, depending on how you answer this. Are you looking for more companies to work with right now or are you just like, "Don't even try. I am so at capacity right now."?

Yuriy Timen (00:08:53):
I'm so at capacity right now. I've also just been very fortunate to always be at capacity. But I think for every four to five companies that I'm working with, think of it as a concentric circles, right? There are another, maybe 10 to a dozen companies that we're actively exploring if we want to work together in the future. And then there is another concentric circle so maybe 30 plus companies that I'm just friends with. So I'll take the plug. I'm always up for meeting Austin founders working on important problems.

Lenny (00:09:31):
Cool. Well, we're in the plug I guess. How do people find you online? What's your Twitter?

Yuriy Timen (00:09:34):
I mean, honestly, probably throw Lenny's podcast. That's one, but honestly LinkedIn is really the only place I'm pretty low key otherwise.

Lenny (00:09:45):
Okay, great. That was a lot of Meta stuff. So let's get into some meat stuff here. So you talked to a lot of consumer startups. You help them figure out how to grow, how to evolve their product, something I'm always curious about and I love your thoughts on is when you look at a consumer startup, I imagine there's a few archetypes of how they grow. I'm curious if that's a mental model you use when you're like, "Oh, I see company X. They're probably going to grow this way, and here's what they should focus on." How do you see that?

Yuriy Timen (00:10:11):
Great question. I think there are ways to answer that. My sweet spot is subscription properties and it's not just consumer. I do work with a lot of B2B companies. It's just that most of them, but what they all have in common is they lean into consumerized type of growth loops and growth motions. So they're very kind of self-serve nature or have meaningful self-serve engines. So if I think about subscription companies, I think there are probably a couple of buckets that I see them falling into. If you were able to nail your unit economics and you have really strong consumer LTVs, think Grammarly, think Canva. The single player LTVs for those companies are very, very high. They're kind of average S&B LTVs for B2B companies.

Lenny (00:11:03):
What's a number there just for folks to have a little context?

Yuriy Timen (00:11:06):
I'm not a liberty to speak to those, but we're talking in the hundreds of dollars. Most consumer subscription companies that are $5 to $7 a month. Their LTVs typically cap out at 50 to 60 bucks.

Lenny (00:11:25):
Cool.

Yuriy Timen (00:11:26):
And so if you have really healthy LTVs, and that usually means that you're attracting a proconsumer buyer, so they may be single player, but they're using it for work. And so maybe they're dispensing it or just the perceived value so much higher that they're willing to bear that $120 and $130 a year subscription. If I'm seeing things like that and I'm seeing that you're converting seven, like five plus percent of your free users to a paid subscriber, then there is a big opportunity to play paid and lean into paid growth loops and paid acquisition loops. There is another archetype, which is if there are network effects for instance, you don't find that as much with single player consumer subscription companies, but obviously social media, consumer companies.

Yuriy Timen (00:12:17):
There may be a strong referral viral loop angle if the utility increases, the utility of the product increases, the more users are using it. Another archetype I see are companies that can lead into SEO very heavily, especially if there is a long tail programmatic angle. Take Canva for instance, their biggest initial growth loop and I think this is public knowledge was their long tail SEO strategy where any kind of design project that you could think of would search for designing. It's kind of two categories of keywords, make keywords and template keywords. So if you're searching for a template of any kind, a wedding invitation, yada yada, they had incredibly strong SEO and they were just capitalizing on all the long tail traffic. Not every product is going to lend itself to that, but I always look for that early on, because you can build incredible mold with that kind of strategy.

Lenny (00:13:21):
That makes sense. There's kind of like these three engines that you can tap into. I imagine the preference would be word of mouth reality and then if that isn't going to work SEO, and if that is going to work paid, maybe just to simplify it for listeners, what are kind of signals you can go after virality and invest in that and think that could work because every founder would be like, "Yes, virality. That's how I'm going to grow." Yeah.

Yuriy Timen (00:13:47):
Yeah. Honestly, the first thing you look for is that, is there inherent product network effects? It's something that it's either there, or isn't from inception from my experience. I think it's very difficult to manufacture. You'd only study when... It's very hard to manufacture product network effects if they aren't there from the get go. So Airbnb from your days, obviously marketplace very strong product network effect dynamics. You think of collaboration tools, Airtable, monday.com, Whimsical, whom we both know very strong inherent product network effects, contrast that with a company like Grammarly. It just wasn't there. It's not an inherently multiplayer task constructed communication. And so you can try to engineer that, but from my experience, it is an uphill battle. So if you have inherent product network effects, that's when I think layering on referral loops and viral loops. You think about what Dropbox has done around file sharing. That's an iconic example.

Yuriy Timen (00:15:02):
Then it's really powerful. I think that there is another case where referral and viral loops could work even when there are inherent network effects. If you have a really beloved product, beloved brand. There's a company out of Australia that I have opportunity to invest it called Laika. They do fresh dog food subscriptions and incredibly beloved brand, a premium product. And so they're able to lean into a give one, get one referrals, even though there isn't inherent product network effects, they're still able to generate meaningful results off of the, and incentivize referring program.

Lenny (00:15:39):
When you talk about network effects, what does that mean to you? How would you define that briefly?

Yuriy Timen (00:15:45):
Yeah, to me, I mean, honestly I define it I think probably a pretty quintessential way, which is for every individual user, the utility that they derive from the product increases the more users there are on the platform. The expanded version of that is in a case of marketplaces. It may not be the bore users broadly speaking, but the more users in the markets that you care about, in the case of collaboration tools, it's not the more users in abstract terms. It's the more users within your team, the more users within your company, right? That correlates with your kind of the rise in your utility curve.

Lenny (00:16:33):
Awesome. So if you have network effects, AKA if the product becomes more useful with more people or there's amazing word of mouth already, or there's collaboration, probably a good sign that you could lean into virality or maybe referrals. What about SEO?

Yuriy Timen (00:16:50):
Oh, that's a good one. It's a very timely question because I actually in a process of helping a couple of my companies figure out if it's the right time to invest in SEO. So I've been sort of a forefront of taking exploratory meetings with agencies and SEO consultants and things like that. I mean, I would say the first thing to figure... I mean, there are a couple of pillars, because obviously we all know that SEO has a different return horizon than say paid acquisition. It's longer out. It's maybe six months is the earliest you can see results. Even then it's going to be a small trickle that compounds over time, if you're successful or you may spend three to six months leaning into an SEO strategy and then realize that it's not going to back out typically at least in historically a company probably isn't like Series B before it starts feeling like it passed a luxury of making these kind of medium to long term investments.

Yuriy Timen (00:17:58):
But I think that's shifting right now, but that's maybe a topic for later or even for another bot but a lot of the strategies that I think we're reserved for Series B are trickling down to Series A companies because they have to diversify way for pay, but maybe more on that later. So I think with SEO, it's like the first pillar I would say is, do you have a unique angle when you take a look at the SEO landscape today, you look at editorial, the landscape, which is to how to searches and who are the players there and what kind of information is being offered? Do you have something unique to contribute to that conversation? Another thing if I have to do an audit checklist, another thing is, do you have a unique programmatic angle, right? For instance, Canva did dealt with templates. Who else is programmatic?

Yuriy Timen (00:18:54):
CWELL, Redfit, obviously all the real estate, right? That's really strong-

Lenny (00:19:00):
Saint Pier.

Yuriy Timen (00:19:01):
Saint Pier, right. So do you have a programmatic angle and then understanding the competitive landscape or the other one is, do you have a unique data angle? So for instance, a company I work with called Monarch Money, which is in the personal finance management space. Think of it as a new and improved version of MIT. There is a lot of users are connecting accounts and you have a sense percenting patterns and things like that. Clearly there is a unique data, and so it's a question of, can you turn it into some kind of valuable organic search experience?

Yuriy Timen (00:19:39):
I won't go into too much detail in terms of what we're thinking of there, but that's another checkbox. If you can check two of those three boxes as a back of the envelope framework, you may be in good shape. And then it's a question of like, "How can you lower the cost of experimentation SEO as much as possible?" I think as a rule of thumb, if you can time box it to three months, what can I do at the end of three months? Is this likely to work or not?

Lenny (00:20:14):
Awesome. Couple follow up questions.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:20:16):
One is SEO feels like this dark art where you need some SEO wizard to come help you through this.

Yuriy Timen (00:20:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:20:25):
Do you suggest companies find somebody or work with an agency or something else? What's your general feeling on SEO versus some other route?

Yuriy Timen (00:20:33):
I think SEO is pretty specialized skill set. There are some basic principles that always hold like best content wins and don't do shady back linking and make sure that you're on page. SEO is good and your pages are easily crawl, but I feel like everybody knows that. And where the winners are determined are between the lines. Better than a sports' analogy? Maybe you can.

Lenny (00:21:10):
Between the lines. I don't know what that comes from.

Yuriy Timen (00:21:15):
But anyway, what I mean is that there is a lot of more nuance, SEO developments and angles, where I think is where the opportunity really lies to differentiate yourself. And that requires keeping up with the latest algorithm changes. It's very hard to do that unless you are specializing in the art where the black magic of SEO, and so that's why I think getting an outside resource at least for an audit is really helpful. Now, whether it's a boutique agency or a solo consultant, I think that's more circumstantial, but I've found at least with the companies that I've worked with, if we wanted to quickly vet the SEO opportunity, I can do it in a very kind of amateur, at an amateur level.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:02):
Plug things into similar web and try to figure out the right option is there, but you can get these relatively inexpensive audits done from companies that you can then choose. Do I hire them to help with my SEO or not? But I think that audit is usually a very good use of time because they have templates. So what they can turn around for five to 10K would take you many, many human hours to try to pull together yourself.

Lenny (00:22:28):
Awesome. Are there agencies that you want to name that people can go check out or would you prefer just to keep it from having-

Yuriy Timen (00:22:35):
I'll give one plug.

Lenny (00:22:37):
Great.

Yuriy Timen (00:22:37):
I think one of the most innovative, disciplined first principles SEO thinkers and I have met is Ethan Smith from Graphite. It's not for everyone. It's a pretty high end SEO shell. So I wouldn't send the Series a company there, but Ethan also produces a lot of resources and what they've been focusing on at Graphite lately has been actually automating a lot of their work and turning it into SAS. So I don't know how far along they are, but you could probably already get into some of the betas from the tools that they're offering.

Lenny (00:23:18):
Sweet. I'm going to try to get Ethan on this podcast.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:21):
I've seen his stuff and it's awesome.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:23):
Yeah. He is a math scientist when it comes to SEO. Yeah.

Lenny (00:23:25):
We need those. We need math scientist on ship.

Yuriy Timen (00:23:28):
Right.

Lenny (00:23:28):
Okay. So we've talked about virality talked about SEO, paid. Imagine that's pretty straightforward if your LTV are high enough and you can pay back ads on those, then that's where you go. Imagine everyone can try it. Doesn't work for everyone. What if yeah, anything you want to add there?

Yuriy Timen (00:23:43):
I mean, there's a lot. There's a lot. I mean, I don't know how deep you want to go down the paid rabbit hole because it's changing. It's probably the most affected growth bucket in light of the market turbulence, the venture sentiment shifting. I've seen paying acquisition strategies at budgets. They are at the brunt of that fallout. And so the question is where do you want to go there?

Lenny (00:24:16):
Yeah. That's a really good topic. I was saving that for later, but let's chat it better right now.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:20):
I imagine part of this is Apple's tracking changes too.

Yuriy Timen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:22):
So I guess my big question is paid still lucrative and a good path for many companies is like 50% of the time less effective. How do you see that shifting recently? And how should people think about paid in the consumer subscription startup?

Yuriy Timen (00:24:38):
Well, I think in the short term, let's break it down into phases. I think in the short term paid acquisition and just paid media dollars are contracted and we're seeing it already with Metas advertising revenue, Snaps advertising revenue. There's clearly a global contraction happening to paid media budgets. A big part of it is because all of a sudden the definition of efficient acquisition and good payback windows is shifting. So before for a consumer subscription company, 12 month payback was decent. Now it's like, you better pay back your paid media in six months or less. That's the sentiment.

Yuriy Timen (00:25:23):
So the thought is reaction is like anything that's more than six months we're well board of six months, we're cutting that and so there's that. Then there is just less tolerance for ambiguity and attribution when the sentiment is like, "Let's grow at [inaudible 00:25:38]. Grow at all costs." If you can't attribute things perfectly, that's okay. Now it's like, especially with venture back companies, you have to have two plus years of runway, managers burn a lot more diligently now. And so whatever you can't attribute to sales sue like, "That shits got to go." I don't know if we can curse on the pod or not.

Lenny (00:25:59):
Only available-

Yuriy Timen (00:26:03):
Well, I've been holding back for the last 30 minutes. No, I'm kidding.

Lenny (00:26:03):
At least.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:04):
All right.

Lenny (00:26:05):
We're not kid friendly, but nobody's cursed yet. So this could be okay. So you'll be the first.

Yuriy Timen (00:26:09):
All right. Way loud. All right. But anyways, yeah. So I think there is a short term contraction. However, that opens up an opportunity for smart kind of attribution investments. So you're seeing an emergence of some interesting attribution related attribution for incrementality related products. A couple that I personally started exploring and looking into, and then you just see a lot more heads of growth, heads of user acquisition, thinking about attribution in building their attribution stacks. And so I think that once we settle into some kind of new normal, which is going to be a combination of just better attribution stack on average for companies combined with just the level of acceptance, that attribution will never be as good as it maybe once was. We're going to probably get hit. Come out of that and you'll see paid budgets start making their way back. But even right now, during contraction, there are going to be some winners.

Yuriy Timen (00:27:26):
The companies that had strong cash positions, have strong unit economics, strong paid back periods already like Grammarly, Canva to name two that I know personally. A couple of others or many others probably, they're going to be winners because all of a sudden, if previously they were competing with companies who were nowhere as efficient as them, but for whatever reason had the green light to keep spending, now all of those are going to pull back their budgets. And so those that have been disciplined, have the instrumentation to track things better than average. They're going to benefit from decreased competition on app platforms, decreasing CPMs, et cetera. So they're going to do winners for sure.

Lenny (00:28:09):
Wow. Haven't heard this perspective. It's so interesting that the fact that it's gotten harder, it's creating new opportunities for companies to do it better and more intelligently. You said you mentioned a couple tools products that you found to be potentially helpful in this. Is there anything you could mention there?

Yuriy Timen (00:28:22):
Yeah. Yeah. I mentioned a couple that I've kind of connected with in the last couple of months. So first of all, Media Mix Modeling is making a comeback, which is something that kind of got popularized in the math meant kind of advertising era of the fifties, pre-digital, and that's how that was the piece of the methodology. I can't speak of the specifics there. The science is a little bit out of depth there, but it was basically a way to use some data to determine a budget allocation across channels at the time was probably newspapers and billboards, et etcetera.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:03):
It was leveraging data to some extent. You would were doing it maybe on a quarterly basis. And then you would only update it every quarter. There was no way with media mix modeling. There was no way to adjust budget in quarter because you weren't getting the data feedback loop that frequently. But media mix modeling is now making a comeback because there are so many offline channels that are part of folks channel portfolio today and that plus a lot of the online channels are becoming less trackable like Meta for instance, with the iOS 14 shift. And so Media Mix Modeling is going to comeback and the company that's leading the charge of bringing the Media Mix Modeling methodology of the traditional advertising era and ushering it into the digital world is a company called the Recast.

Lenny (00:29:48):
Recast.

Yuriy Timen (00:29:48):
Recast. Yeah. So I've heard really good things. I haven't tried them with any of my companies yet, but there are a couple that are on the horizon hopefully.

Lenny (00:29:58):
Double click there for a moment. Is that still useful if you're not doing TV and other forms of advertising?

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
I think it's still-

Lenny (00:30:04):
You're just doing-

Yuriy Timen (00:30:04):
Yeah, I think it's useful if you're spending a considerable amount, what's considerable, I'd say worth of a hundred thousand a month update media. And if you have some level of channel complexity, so you're not just like a Google Go or a Facebook, but maybe you're on three plus the channels. Then I think it still makes sense. The other ones in the incremental space, they have very different methodologists actually, because at end of the day, this might be obvious to folks, but maybe some will find value.

Yuriy Timen (00:30:34):
Click based attribution or the digital attribution were all fawning over cookie based and click based, a real parameter based attribution. It never demonstrated a causal relationship between our media spend and business results. It was only good for correlative insights. And the only way to determine causality is through real controlled experiments, randomized control experiments through incrementality testing, which is typically really hard to do cleanly and also companies have always been often wary about doing it because you have to turn off a channel potentially in a key demo and you're like, "Yeah." The benefit is to learning of whether it's actually incremental, but the cost or the sales that I will lose today. But the only way to really know how effective your paid media is through ongoing incrementality testing. So there are two companies that are addressing that. Two that I'm excited about. One is measured, can be found, measured.call, amazing domain name.

Lenny (00:31:44):
Amazing domain name, go with that.

Yuriy Timen (00:31:45):
And then the other one is incremental, but incremental-

## Transcript

Casey Winters (00:00:00):
Every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

Lenny (00:00:41):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Casey Winters. Casey was one of the first ever guests on the podcast, and the first to make a return appearance. He's a legend in the growth and product community, having worked with or advised companies like Pinterest, Reddit, Canva, Airbnb, Tinder, Thumbtack, Grubhub, and many more. He recently led product at Eventbrite for just about three years, and recently returned to full-time advising, and he's exploring new opportunities.

(00:01:17):
In our chat, we cover something he calls the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager and how to avoid that, what he's found works best when interviewing product managers, what impact he expects from GPT-4 on the role of product management, when to trust your instincts versus your team's insights and instincts, what are all the different kinds of network effects, and how do you effectively leverage them? Plus a great story about what Grubhub missed that let DoorDash and Uber eat their lunch. I always learn so much from chatting with Casey, and I am 100% sure you will learn a lot from this episode. With that, I bring you Casey Winters, after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but if there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack, this leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. 

(00:02:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. 

(00:03:37):
Casey, welcome back to the podcast.

Casey Winters (00:03:39):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:41):
You are the first ever return guest to my podcast. How does that feel?

Casey Winters (00:03:46):
I feel honored, perhaps a bit unworthy, but I'll go with it.

Lenny (00:03:52):
Well, you're both worthy and I'm honored as well. Thanks for joining me again. I have a lot of stuff that I want to chat about, but first of all, I'm just curious, what are you up to these days? I know you left Eventbrite as CPO, I know you're doing a few advisorships with startups, but how are you spending your days, and what do you think is next for Casey Winters?

Casey Winters (00:04:10):
I'm still spending some time with Whatnot and Eventbrite as  advisors. I stepped back from the CPO of Eventbrite in October, but still working on some long-term marketplace strategy stuff, some growth strategy stuff. I'm on the board of a company called Beek, which is like Netflix for audio in Latin America, and I'm doing some angel investing in marketplaces in what I call tech debt as a service, which is what are startups that are building out things that were hard for my teams in the past to build or maintain inside previous companies? The other thing I'm working on is revamping the product strategy program for Reforge. I got some things keeping me busy, but definitely not as busy as I was last year.

Lenny (00:04:53):
This is like a rare, free agent Case Winters time. Should people reach out if they're interested in maybe working with you? What's your advice for people listening?

Casey Winters (00:05:00):
Yeah. I always love seeing how I can help companies. Everyone should err on the side of reaching out and seeing if I have time to help, if there's something they think I can help with. I love talking to startups, so yeah, absolutely. I can't promise anything, but yeah, I just love talking to people about this stuff.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Awesome. We'll point people to how to get in touch with you at the end of the episode, and it'll be in the show notes too. Talking about the CPO role, you're at Eventbrite. You're a CPO. It reminds me of a post you wrote about how hard the CPO role is. There's some quotes that I recall in your post about how, one, if you ever ask a CPO, chief product officer how they're doing, no one's ever going to say, "I'm crushing it right now."

Casey Winters (00:05:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:05:41):
Then there's this other quote about how you basically, as a CPO, just try to put some points on the board before you inevitably get fired. Why is that? Why do you find that, and do you still believe that to be true after leaving that role? 

Casey Winters (00:05:53):
Yeah, I would say I still believe those things I said. It was funny. A product leader who will remain nameless emailed me when I hit year three at Eventbrite, and they said, "Congrats. You didn't get fired after two years. What's your secret?" I think it's very hard to keep product-market fit as a CPO within a company for a long time. The needs of the business shift over time, and of course, we all have different strengths and weaknesses in our game. No one's perfect at everything. In general, as an executive, it's just impossible to do everything perfectly, and any little misstep, mistake, or something you just missed can blow up in a major way. 

(00:06:33):
Frequently, CEOs have visions that can change and get misaligned with the product leader. Also, with leadership roles, you don't get put on a PIP. If a CEO loses confidence, it's over immediately. Nothing like that happened at Eventbrite. I started to see that the areas of leverage for a product leader were just less in my wheelhouse over time. I just talked to my boss about it, and we worked out something where I continue to advise on the things that I'm uniquely good at, and find other people who are better at some of these other things that were maybe more important at the time.

(00:07:09):
Yeah, I'd say it's a really hard role, or a really challenging role. It can be a lot of fun. I learned a lot from doing it, but yeah, I still believe, and I think I've still yet to hear someone say they've really crushed it. 

Lenny (00:07:26):
Is there anything that you learned from that experience to have survived in that role for three years? I imagine you have a lot of skills and you were very valuable to the company, but I don't know, for someone in that's role maybe right now, just like, "Here's something that I did that maybe you should do." 

Casey Winters (00:07:40):
The first one I can think of is a big change from being a product leader to a CPO or something equivalent is you're actually a company exec first and a product exec second. I think some mistakes I made early that I corrected successfully is you want to show that you are caring and paying attention to the overall business first before just taking care of your own product designers, product managers, researchers, whoever. That's advice I found myself doling out to other product leaders a lot more now that I've gone through it. You have to not only truly care, but create the perception that you care about sales, about marketing, about legal, et cetera. Because first and foremost, you're expected to lead the business at that level, so I think that's something that I think is really important.

(00:08:35):
I think something else is really trying to diagnose, without as much bias as possible, where are the strengths and weaknesses of your team? Where are the strengths and weaknesses of your product? Lay that out with your peers and say, "Here's where we are. Here's where I think we need to go. Here's the timeline on which I'm going to work to get us there." Because I think product's such a confusing discipline for people who aren't in it, like a sales leader, many CEOs, a marketing leader, that they don't necessarily know what great looks like. 

(00:09:14):
The things they know about great leadership, they don't know if you know those things, so you have to make it really clear, "Yeah, I know our OKRs are not as quantitative as they should be yet. That's because this team isn't ready for X, Y, and Z. This is where we're going to get them to, but it's going to take some time." One of the things we did at Eventbrite that I thought was really helpful is, when you go public, you tend to rotate over your executive team and get public company execs versus startup execs. A few of us were new, and it's just like, "Hey, let's do a deep dive on product. Let's do a deep dive on customer support. Where's it at right now? What do you feel like your job is? What do you feel like are the issues you're facing? Where do you want to take it over the next three to five years? Then, let's talk about it."

(00:09:57):
Just forcing you to write it all down is really helpful, but then it forces you to explain it. It helps the rest of the executive team get better company execs because now they really understand product a lot more deeply, or understand finance a lot more deeply, whatever the function is.  

Lenny (00:10:15):
Speaking of gaps and opportunities for people in the company to level up, you've been highlighting this trend that I thought was really interesting, something you call the zero interest rate phenomenon product manager. Can you talk about what that is and what you've been noticing?

Casey Winters (00:10:33):
Yeah, sure thing. This is something I started noticing while managing PMs and product designers at Eventbrite, and it's now coming up with Whatnot as I help them hire new PMs, is the environment in which a lot of product managers have come up is very distorted from when you and I started doing this kind of work. I think we used to always describe PMs as this gang of misfits. We all started in all different functions. We all had different strengths and weaknesses, and the PM team gained as a whole from that diversity of skills and previous experiences.

(00:11:12):
What I noticed is, when we started doing product reviews at Eventbrite, if there was any sort of uncertainty in a problem or a solution, the product manager, instead of shipping to learn, would talk about all this research they have to do to really learn the problems, really learn the solution. 

(00:11:30):
My feedback would be like, no, user research is a scarce resource. We have to reserve it for the areas that have extreme uncertainty and high leverage for getting to certain, so if you're redesigning the login page for Eventbrite, you don't need to use that resource to learn what to do. Just go see what FANG and the top unicorns did. They probably did a good job, and even if they didn't, all of our customers also use those products, so they're going to be familiar with us copying any approach that they've taken.

(00:12:05):
I think we sort of forgot in the industry that many times, the fastest way to learn is to ship, so that if you actually get them to skip research and just go look at competitors, another thing I was noticing is I'd get a list of options other companies have done, but there would be no analysis of why those companies chose different options and what's most applicable for us. 

(00:12:31):
It got me thinking, okay, every new person on the product team is acting like they work at Google and have these infinite resources and infinite time to make sure everything is perfect. It became such this focus on the right way of doing product management that no one's taken any risk. I felt like, oh, am I responsible for this? I've created a bunch of frameworks on Reforge. I'm onboarding these new PMs. Is this my fault? At Reforge, we're building frameworks that are tools in a toolkit. You pull them out when relevant. They're not a coloring book to stay inside the lines of.

(00:13:10):
At one point, I got so fed up, I wrote an internal blog post, and I called it On Best Practices and Breakfast Rituals. I talked about how there were these articles about the morning habits of the most successful people, and if you try to do all those things, it'd take you like six hours every morning. There was this article, I think it was on Business Insider or something, about this futurist at Google. He talked about all the pills and food he eats for breakfast every morning to try to live longer. The reporter estimated that it cost him one million a year to have these habits, so I was like, "Hey, I want to make it clear. At Eventbrite, we don't have that much money. We don't have that much time. There's no framework that allows you to not use your brain at this company and just follow some sort of process for success in this profession."

(00:14:02):
I adopted this thing into a public blog post that's on my blog now, but now that I've had some time outside of Eventbrite, I feel like I at least partially missed the mark on what's really going on. I see this with Whatnot, because one of the things I'm helping them with is interviewing, I see PMs again, which I haven't done in a while. It's fascinating interviewing a PM or managers early in their career because Whatnot is a startup, and you know better than most of us as a former founder of one, startups typically require us to wear lots of hats. You have to write SQL. You have to talk directly to customers. You have to prep marketing and sales. Most importantly, you have to make a lot of decisions under uncertainty, which you wouldn't necessarily expect a PM to do at, say, a Google, but it all boils down to using your brain in different ways.

(00:14:54):
Lisa, who's on our legal team, she called Eventbrite a public startup because the pandemic basically erased her business and we had to build it back from scratch. Now that I'm doing these interviews, and whether they come from a small startup, a unicorn, or a public company, they all sort of look the same because there's been so much funding to all these companies. Every company's been acting like they're Google with Google margins, meaning a lot of engineering support, a lot of design support, a lot of research support, lots of analysts around them.

(00:15:22):
They actually seem pretty ill-prepared for a real startup, or even a public company with some uncertainty around it like Eventbrite, so you start getting these weird responses in the interview process. You ask them to solve a problem and they'd say things like, "I can't even begin to come up with solutions until I see all the data and talk to customers." I'm like, "Yeah, I get that's something you would normally do if you took the job, but you don't have the data. You can't talk to customers. Make a decision now. What would you do? I want to see how creative you are. I want to see how much you're intuiting about the real problem and solution," and they can't really answer. 

(00:15:56):
Then my follow-up, which I don't ask, but what I really want to ask is like, "When's the last time you used your brain versus followed a process someone else designed at your company?" Because I want the former, not the latter.

Lenny (00:16:09):
Wow. Amazing. There's a lot of things I want to dig into here. I was going to ask why you call it zero interest rate phenomenon, but I think what I'm hearing is it's when interest rates are zero, everyone's got a lot of money, things are going great. Everyone looks like they're killing it, successful. Everyone thinks they've got it all figured out, and then when that goes away, it's like, "Oh, shit. Maybe not so." 

Casey Winters (00:16:27):
Then also, I think zero interest rates allowed every startup to operate like it was a public company with billions of dollars. That's going to go away over the next five years, and it sort of takes us back to what product management used to be like, which was you didn't have all these resources around. You didn't have all this time to figure it out because if you don't figure it out now and make it work, you may run out of funding, right?

Lenny (00:16:51):
Yeah. Like a very concrete thing that's changed as a lot of research teams have been laid off because they grew really large and companies found, "Maybe we need don't need the ..." Like, "Of all the things we can cut, it's probably an area we can cut." 

Casey Winters (00:17:02):
Yeah, for sure. 

Lenny (00:17:04):
There's probably PMs listening to this wondering, "Shoot, am I one of these? Am I just following a bunch of frameworks?" What's your advice for someone that may fear that, "Oh, shoot. This is maybe who I am and I don't want to necessarily be this"? What could they maybe do?

Casey Winters (00:17:17):
I always advise going to companies where you can learn quickly and try things. I think it's certainly okay to learn a bunch of frameworks. There's a reason I've invested a ton of time in Reforge because I think it actually really does help people to see how other people build things in a way that they can scale it to their other companies, but you have to understand that the job is not to follow the process. The job is not to learn every framework possible. The job is to figure out how to add value to customers that translates into value to the business. Just reorient your North Star, if you've gotten away from that.

(00:17:53):
When I joined Eventbrite, there was this team that didn't ship anything in a quarter. I went to the designer who I knew, and I know that he likes to get stuff out there and likes to get feedback. I was like, "Dude, you didn't ship anything. How could you have gone the entire quarter, not shipped any of your designs and felt that that was okay? If you didn't feel it was okay, why did you censor yourself? Come to me. Tell me why this team is not letting you ship. There's just no way you can get better as a designer. There's no way you can have the impact on the company. There's no way you can have an impact on our users." Those are some things that come to mind to that question.

Lenny (00:18:36):
If you're a PM on a team that maybe isn't shipping, maybe is overusing research, do you have any advice of just like when it makes sense to invest in research? Say you have the resources, is there a rule of thumb you have of like, "Okay. Let's actually spend the time on this verse not"? 

Casey Winters (00:18:51):
I think about it a little bit, depending on the type of job you have and the types of customers you have. The more scale you have tends to be you have less sophisticated customers because you're generally like a consumer thing where the customers are rational. They're not experts. That's generally where you just try things. You measure the impact they have, and you only really bring in USEARCH, research when the impact seems confusing, but you can run experiments. You can get data really easily, so bias towards getting stuff out there and seeing what users respond to.

Lenny (00:19:30):
In consumer product.

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:31):
Interesting. 

Casey Winters (00:19:31):
If you're super enterprise, it's the opposite. Each customer, first off, is sophisticated and tend to be rational. They're paying you like six figures or more, and you could talk to the customers and sales, who knows the customers really well directly, and they tell you want they want. They tell you what they're willing to pay for. You build it. They pay you. Bing, bang, boom. It's not, obviously, as simple as that, but you're basically doing the research directly with the customer and with the sales team, and translating that into things that are strategic to the business.

(00:20:02):
I would say those are the two extremes probably most people are familiar with, but we now have a lot of companies in the middle, where they have more customers. Those customers are more sophisticated. They're consumers. They're maybe employees at companies, or they're small businesses. That's where you have to be more nuanced. This, of course, is where Eventbrite was on, "Hey, when do I really lean in on research? When do I lean in on data? When do I pay attention to internal feedback?

(00:20:29):
" For Eventbrite, we really tried to focus research on the B2B side of Eventbrite, where the problems seemed big, but not well-defined enough. Or that problem's well-defined, but we just really don't feel like we have the right solution yet. If research is going to be a scarce resource inside the company, which I think it will in most places, you have to figure out where it's a high-leverage area, which means either really big problem, we don't understand it well enough, or we know the problem's big. We understand it well, but we're just not sure if our solution's going to, in any way, hit the mark. 

Lenny (00:21:06):
Makes me think about some of the best researchers I've worked with, and they often tell me like, "We don't need to do research on this. We have enough information. We have other things we should be doing."

Casey Winters (00:21:13):
I love it when they say that. Yes.

Lenny (00:21:15):
Yeah. This would have been a really good segue to another topic I want to talk about, which is around gut instincts versus team expertise, which we're going to get to, but I have a couple more questions along these lines. 

Casey Winters (00:21:24):
Sure. 

Lenny (00:21:25):
You talked about interviewing PMs at Whatnot. Can you actually describe Whatnot? Just because you mentioned it a couple times, just so people know what we're talking about here.

Casey Winters (00:21:33):
Oh, sure. Whatnot's a livestreaming marketplace, mostly focused on the collectibles market. Sellers, whether it's like baseball cards, or women's handbags, or sneakers, they'll go live on video and show you the products they have that they're selling. People that are watching the stream can engage with the sellers and bid on different items, so kind of like Twitch meets eBay would be a good way to describe it. 

Lenny (00:21:54):
Awesome, awesome. I'll just mention, I'm a tiny angel investor in that company. 

Casey Winters (00:21:56):
Oh, that's why you brought it up. Okay, I get it.

Lenny (00:22:00):
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure people understood what this word was because it's like a fun word, Whatnot. What I wanted to actually get to is you said you were interviewing a lot of project managers for them.

Casey Winters (00:22:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:09):
What is your approach to interviewing PMs? What do you find is a really good signal for someone that's going to be successful?

Casey Winters (00:22:14):
I feel like the whole thing's gotten so performative. It's like interviewing is handing out Oscars based on who's prepared the best tell me about a time response, versus actually assessing who can do the job we're hiring for. It's like most PMs are better PM interviewers than PMs now. There's this quote from a movie called The Way of the Gun. I don't know if you've ever seen it.

Lenny (00:22:35):
No.

Casey Winters (00:22:36):
Benicio del Toro says in it, it's like, "These days, they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime." I think about that quote a lot when it comes to interviewing. I would say I'm a bit contrarian here in my approach. I don't ask about your work history. I don't care about your perfectly practiced answers. I'm going to give you real scenarios that I expect from the role. I want to hear how you'd approach them. If you can't come up with a few reasonable ideas, figure out how to test them quickly without analyst support or research, I'm just not interested.

(00:23:10):
I'm not saying this is a perfect approach. Interviewing is a very lossy format, but the more I can see them do the job we're hiring for with questions, whether it's a presentation, a prompt, that gets me the most comfortable that they know the job they're signing up for, that they've shown in a practice scenario they can do it, and they actually enjoyed it in some way.

Lenny (00:23:29):
Are there red flags you look for in these interviews? One is maybe you said of like, "I can't even begin to answer this without research and data." Is there anything else?

Casey Winters (00:23:36):
Some things I pay attention to is if they're talking about solutions that are going to take a long time to get signal from, whether it's months and months of engineering time before you actually see the impact on users or the business, I think that's always great. If they're not factoring in the amount of time it will take, in general, is not a good sign, and not thinking a bit more holistically about the types of metrics they expect to improve versus track to make sure they haven't gone down. Those are some things that I pay a lot of attention to.

Lenny (00:24:11):
How much do you think they're intimidated by being interviewed by Casey Winters? How much do you think that factors in?

Casey Winters (00:24:16):
I think you overestimate my importance or awareness in the community. I think most people have no idea who I am when they start talking to me.

Lenny (00:24:25):
Mm-hmm. [inaudible 00:24:25] Another thought is there's this meme that GBT-4, or 5, or 6, or 10 is going to replace product managers, and anytime some new feature comes out, people will put out these videos of, "Oh, look. They're doing all the PM's jobs." What's your take on the future of PM in AI, if any?

Casey Winters (00:24:41):
Well, I think if you thought the PM job was just filling in the latest Reforge or Shreyas framework, and then getting that automatic FANG promotion every year and a half, then yeah, you're going to get replaced by AI. I think the real PM job is the least likely to get replaced over time because you need real subject matter expertise. You need to be trading off a lot of different types of things, and making good decisions for the company and for your customers. 

(00:25:10):
In terms of using AI now as a PM, I'd actually be cautious in the current iteration of the cycle for PMs. It's a tool that's trained on sounding smart rather than always necessarily being smart. I was at Eventbrite the other day, and someone was telling me how they were loving the new Notion AI integration. She asked me if I used it. I said, "No." She's like, "Ah, you totally need to. Hey, go ask it your bio. It's really cool." I said, "All right. Let's just do it on your screen," so she did and my bio said I started my career at Google, and worked on Google Trends, and a bunch of other products, none of which happened. It was just complete nonsense.

(00:25:52):
It did have some stuff that did happen. It knew I worked at Eventbrite, and it knew I worked at Pinterest and stuff, but half of it was just completely made up. It sounded plausible, but it wasn't actually true. I think where I'm more inclined for PMs to try to get leverage out of something like GPT-4 is a lot of the tedious work that's maybe not their specialty to begin with. If you're not great at Excel or Google Sheets and you need to model something, you can ask it to format something. That'll probably be perfect, or how to get some Zapier integration to work. It probably knows how to do that really well.

(00:26:28):
I think, at this point, it's a pretty good no-code to low-code tool. It's obviously going to become a lot more than that, but for a lot of these other use cases that people are touting, there's a decent chance, confidently tells you the wrong thing, and that would scare me as a PM. 

Lenny (00:26:45):
I've had the exact same experience. I had to describe what I've done, and it was like 70% mistaken. 

Casey Winters (00:26:52):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:26:53):
Is there anything you've found value in yet with GPT of any kind in your work, or is it still kind of just poking around and novelty for you?

Casey Winters (00:27:00):
Yeah. I've had a couple of those things where it's like, "Hey, how do I actually get this weird thing done?" It's been like clear bullet points, take these steps, and I'm like, "Oh, great. This was actually really hard to find on Google." Things like that, I actually quite like it for, so that's where my head goes to more confidently use it. Of course, I'll try it and if it's wrong-

Lenny (00:27:24):
Just throw it away. 

Casey Winters (00:27:25):
... I'll learn where it's wrong, so it's low-risk, but it's been right on some of those things and it's like, "Oh, cool. I couldn't figure out how to do that." There was something on Google Docs that I needed to figure out how to do that was kind of fancy. I asked ChatGPT. It told me how to do it, and I was like, "Oh, great." 

Lenny (00:27:39):
I had a similar experience where I just needed a formula in Google Sheets, and just told it like, "I need this thing," and it just gives me the actual formula. 

Casey Winters (00:27:45):
Yeah, that's so magical when it happens. 

Lenny (00:27:47):
Yeah. I don't know. I'm not that good with Sheets formulas. Shifting course a little bit, you also wrote this really interesting post on founder intuition versus team expertise. There's a lot to it, and I think it's a really interesting topic because it's this classic discussion that startups have. How much should a founder trust their gut, and how much should it be top-down, "Here's what we should be doing" versus the team, bottom-up, figure out what to build? I'd love to spend a little time here. Maybe just to start broadly, what is this? You came up with a framework of how to think about when founder intuition should overrule, say, team expertise, and how that change over time, so maybe just talk about that. 

Casey Winters (00:28:26):
Yeah. If founders are lucky/good enough to find product-market fit, they've usually built up all this intuition about their customers, about their product, and their business that are really hard to explain to others and may even be subconscious. When they start to hire people, these people will come in with a lot of excitement, ideas, maybe even really relevant experience, especially senior leaders. I've seen some founders are like, "Cool. I need to let these experts start to own these areas and get out of the geek house." I think that's actually the opposite of what you want, because none of these people know the business as well as you get it. You actually need to direct them until they show you they've really got it and are making better decisions than you would. 

(00:29:17):
This is not a founder example, but I remember when I hired Erika Warren to build out our loyalty program at Grubhub, and she now leads growth at Change.org. After a month or so, she was like, "Dude, you're in all my meetings. I got this." That let me know she was in a different part of the situational leadership framework than I had put her in, so I backed away, and she crushed it from there.

(00:29:40):
Founders will put a lot of new leaders in that delegate bucket too quickly. It's like, "Ah, they got it. They know more than me," when founders actually know the right answer and should just tell them. This can, of course, change like in the case of Erika. If you hire the right people, they do get smarter than you. You can and you should start delegating. Many founders don't notice the signals where their founder intuition has been usurped by team expertise, or maybe it's just ebbed in effectiveness over time. That, of course, makes sense. Founders have all these different things they're dealing with, and your employees can really dive deep in certain areas. I encourage employees to proactively signal both directions, like, "Hey, I need direction from you." Or, "Hey, I got it from here. Trust me on this one."

Lenny (00:30:27):
Interesting. You're saying, as a founder, the heuristic should be if you feel confident about a decision, generally, you should be clear, like, "Hey, I think I know what we need to be doing here," and don't just make people feel better, necessarily, by just saying, "Okay. You tell us what you want to do." Then on the flip side, as an employee at the company, if you feel really confident about something, make it clear to the founder like, "I really think this is the right move." Is there anything more you want to add there?

Casey Winters (00:30:55):
Yeah. Well, there's obviously the feedback loop of that, of what happens when you do either of those things. Depending on the founder's response to that or the employee's response to that, there's different approaches you can take.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Part of this, you have this cool chart of just over time, the founder expertise becomes less and less relevant. I guess, is that because they just don't spend as much time with the customers because they have other stuff going on or they hire people that are smarter, and then over time, the team expertise goes up?

Casey Winters (00:31:26):
If you're lucky enough to scale a company, there's just more and more things going on that all will reach the founder in some way, but it means more breadth and less depth on any particular issue, and the reverse is true for people you hire. They're able to get really deep into things that maybe you were really deep into two years ago but you just can't stay deep in anymore. I built this chart on, or I guess I should say table on the different phases of a startup. When you're finding product-market fit, everything goes through the founders. You cannot outsource that.

(00:32:08):
Then when you start scaling the company because you found product-market fit, it's the first time that founders run into this classic problem of what got you here won't get you there. What got you to product-market fit was iterating on product and doing things that don't scale. Guess what? You found a product that works. Don't do that anymore. Make it scale. Don't come up with new products. You found the one that works. The reason I came up with this framework originally is when I was at Grubhub, we were scaling pretty nicely and fairly organically. 

(00:32:39):
I think Mike and Matt, the founders, had intuited these phases of building a company pretty well, but we acquired a competitor and I saw how that company we acquired operated. Even though they were largely in the same phase as us, they still operated like they were founding the company. Everything was going through the founder. Intuitively, I was like, "Oh, this is why we're acquiring you, and not the other way around." 

(00:33:09):
I think it's really hard for founders to get those signals organically, and I think it's up to us as employees to help. The founders can listen to the signals or not listen to those signals, but that's part of why we're here, but we should also give those signals when we're confident we really get it. Not come in day one being, "I know what your sales strategy should be. You're doing it all wrong." Because chances are, the founders weren't doing it all wrong. They knew something you don't know about yet.

Lenny (00:33:34):
What is it that you think made it such that you won and they didn't? Is it because they didn't invest, they didn't shift to scaling and delegating to their employees as much as the founder just telling everyone to do it?

Casey Winters (00:33:43):
Correct, right. Everything was not moving as quickly because everything had to go through the same person to get done. It just allowed them to not launch as many markets, not sign up as many restaurants, to not figure out as many growth channels, yeah, as we had done.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Got it. They just bottlenecked themselves and they weren't able to move as fast because the founder thought they needed to make these decisions, and they were still the ones that knew everything.

Casey Winters (00:34:08):
Yep.

Lenny (00:34:09):
That makes me think about most companies. Maybe not most, but many founders just believe they have the answers. They are confident they know what to do, and it's rare they get to a place of like, "Nah, I actually don't."

# The ultimate guide to product-led sales | Elena Verna

## Transcript

Elena Verna (00:00:00):
The most important thing in product-led sales is that there is a different configuration internally of collaboration that needs to occur. In traditional sales world, marketing creates pipeline for sales. Sales sells product. Product engages with a paid user to drive retention. In the product-led sales, product acquires and activates a customer and product creates pipeline for sales, so relationship is not that there's a go-to-market org with marketing and sales and product just kind of throws features across the fence for them to sell. 

(00:00:40):
The collaboration here is between product and sales, but that means the product has to take on accountability over pipeline. The worst thing that you can do is to say, "I'm going to do product-led growth," or, "I'm going to do product-led sales and I'm going to do it in marketing." Recipe for disaster. You'll be failure mode within six months because product has to take accountability over selling of the product itself. 

Lenny (00:01:09):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Elena Verna. If that name sounds familiar, Elena is a return guest and you be the judge, but I think this episode is even better than the first, which is a very high bar because that first episode continues to be one of the most popular of the podcast. Elena has worked at or advised companies like Miro, Amplitude, SurveyMonkey, MongoDB, Netlify, and a dozen others. She's also a longtime instructor and EIR at Reforge where she helped create their experimentation, monetization, growth, leadership, and their soon-to-be released PLG course. 

(00:01:51):
In this conversation, we go incredibly deep into the emerging space of product-led sales. Elena explains what exactly is product-led sales, how it fits together with product-led growth and sales-led growth, who and when you should consider investing product-led sales, how product-led sales changes your approach to sales and marketing, what sorts of data, tooling, and people you need in place to do it well, and what common pitfalls you need to avoid. I've said this before and I'll say it again, Elena is possibly the smartest and most experienced growth person in the world, especially when it comes to B2B, and I never get tired of learning from her. Enjoy this episode with Elena Verna after a short word from our sponsors.

Elena, welcome back to the podcast.

Elena Verna (00:05:09):
Thank you for having me back. I thought I would be the first returning guest. I'm a little bit upset that I am been beat by Casey, so you should explain yourself on that one.

Lenny (00:05:19):
Okay, here's the explanation. You're the first that we rebooked back and then this one just kind of got pushed a little bit and Casey had a slot earlier, so technically you were the first scheduled return guest.

Elena Verna (00:05:31):
All right, all right. I'll accept that.

Lenny (00:05:34):
Okay, great. I'm off the hook. I guess I'll just say I am really excited to have you back. Your episode that we did maybe a year ago is still one of the most popular episodes of all time. I still see people tweeting about it and sharing it, and so I am really excited to have you back and have a take two.

Elena Verna (00:05:48):
I'm excited to be back. Let's dive in.

Lenny (00:05:51):
Before we get into the content, when we met last time you were Interim Head of Growth at Amplitude. What are you up to now? What's happened in the past year?

Elena Verna (00:06:00):
I just wrapped up interim gig at Amplitude in February, so it's just been a couple of months since then. I'm passively exploring if I'm going to take another interim position, but between interim roles I always take about six to eight months of break because interim rolls are very intense because there's so many deliverables that are loaded in in the first year that you're working at the company, so I'm just advising. I have incredible companies that I started advising such as Veed.io and Sanity and Clockwise, and I'm building up my next level of frameworks that I'm going to dive into potentially a new interim position to prototype.

Lenny (00:06:38):
Ooh. If people are listening to this and they're like, "How do I get to work with Elena?", should people reach out to you? Are you booked up? What do you suggest?

Elena Verna (00:06:47):
I'll never take down an opportunity to have a great conversation and to learn about the business and to see how I can be helpful, but I'm not proactively sourcing clients, but that doesn't mean that I don't have availability to schedule something in the future.

Lenny (00:07:02):
Awesome, so if it's amazing enough, you're open to it?

Elena Verna (00:07:05):
Absolutely, always. 

Lenny (00:07:06):
Okay, great. Okay, here we go. Great [inaudible 00:07:07]-

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
I always have to be-

Lenny (00:07:08):
... [inaudible 00:07:08].

Elena Verna (00:07:08):
... open to new opportunities, yes.

Lenny (00:07:10):
I love that. I feel the same way. FOMO. FOMO kicks in. Anyway, as you know, we're going to be devoting this entire podcast to just one topic, which is product-led sales, which is this go-to-market motion that seems to have emerged over the past year maybe a bit longer and just feels like there's this increasing amount of interest and also this increasing amount of confusion around what it is, how to approach it, who it's right for. We're going to spend the next hour diving really deep into product-led sales.

Elena Verna (00:07:39):
Let's go for it.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Let's do it. Okay, so let's just start with a bigger picture kind of question of just, how do you define product-led sales? What is product-led sales, especially when it comes to what is it versus product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:07:54):
Great question, so let's start with product-led growth. We've talked about it a little bit in our first episode, but let's revisit the topic. Product led growth is all about product's ability to self-serve activate, self-serve engage, and convert that usage to a monetization opportunity. You bring people, you get them to an aha moment into the habit loops, and then you able to extract value back out of them. Extraction of the value can be direct where you're actually capturing revenue from them, or it can be indirect where they're participating in your growth model via virality or user-generated content and bring additional business through the doors. 

(00:08:34):
Let's talk about direct phase to capture that value. There's self-serve monetization, so I'm using product self-serve. I go to the pricing page. I find the plan that best suits me on features that I want to unlock or usage that I want to unlock and I buy it. However, that's not the only way to monetize that usage. You can monetize that usage with sales, too. Why? Self-serve monetization has a cap of about $10,000. That's just how much we're able to process on the credit cards before they start getting flagged and declined by the banks and how much we as a consumers and prosumers are even willing to put on our credit card because not all credit cards have limits of over 10, 20, 30, $40,000. 

(00:09:15):
Self-serve monetization is very much a prosumer use case where an individual is trying to solve the problem on their own. Product-led sales converts the usage that you've generated via self-serve into a sales opportunity and it attaches a salesperson to close a much larger contract, which can be 15, 20, a hundred thousand dollars in order to bring an enterprise-level solution to a company that has already been using it in a self-serve manner.

Lenny (00:09:44):
Amazing. Would you say that product-led growth has always been in a sense product-led sales because sales was involved and theirs has been kind of like way of describing it? Or is this a new trend and way of approaching product-led growth?

Elena Verna (00:09:59):
Product-led growth has actually started more on individual use case-

Lenny (00:10:06):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:06):
... so an individual has a problem. They have a job to be done. They come into the product and they solve it, and that was product-led growth in a nutshell for a lot of the B2B companies. However, if you're going to attach a salesperson, there is nobody in the company that is going to pay 10, 15, $20,000 for one individual to solve their problem. Product-led sales assumes that there's a migration from an individual use case that you acquired an end user with and an escalation into an enterprise-level solution that solves enterprise-level problems. Let me break it down and let me use just, for example, Amplitude as an example.

Lenny (00:10:46):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:10:47):
Amplitude, individual, what is individual wanted with Amplitude? I need data at my fingertips to make better decisions for my product, so I'm going to put an Amplitude SDK into my product and it gives me behavioral data to help me build my pillar better. What is the company-level solution? Well, it's more self-serve ability of the data. It's democratization of data. It's enhanced insights in the more data-driven culture. That's what company's solving for. Individual is not solving for data-driven culture. Individual is just solving for data insights for them. Company's solving for data-driven culture.

(00:11:25):
In product-led growth, you can just have an individual be very happy with their solution for their job to be done. However, what product-led sales assumes is that there is an escalator to an enterprise-level solution, and enterprise escalator is valuable to attach sales resources to because products fundamentally do a really bad job at communicating enterprise-level value prop. They're very good at showing you as a user what you can do. They've very terrible at showing what organization actually can benefit out of the solution.

(00:12:02):
Sales can tell that story. Sales can bridge that gap, and then you can increase the perceived value in order to bridge the gap to that $15,000, 20, hundred-thousand dollar contract. I would say self-serve monetization is very much an individual use case versus product-led sales is turning that individual use case and self-serve usage into a sales pipeline with enterprise-level value.

Lenny (00:12:28):
I really like that way of thinking about it. Basically product-led growth has a ceiling. You're only going to get-

Elena Verna (00:12:32):
Yes.

Lenny (00:12:33):
... so high in terms of spend. You can only explain things so much to a potential user and then sales comes in and solves a lot of those problems, and product-led sales is essentially this. I think you even have this visualization now that I'm thinking about-

Elena Verna (00:12:33):
It's a bridge.

Lenny (00:12:45):
... as a bridge. Right, yeah, this bridge between the two, and so in this world of product-led sales, does sales as a function, outbound sales, continue to exist? One, and then two, is it radically different in this world of product-led sales?

Elena Verna (00:12:59):
Yeah, so to understand how sales should be applied in the situation, you need to understand end user's motivation, ability, and permission. Simple organization, so for example, if the end user is very motivated, they have full sense of ability to solve the problem and they have all of the permission from organization, or maybe not even permission, maybe forgiveness from organization, to go and explore and bring in a new solution. Then, it can be a very much organic motion up that escalator. However, that's not always the case. A lot of times the end users miss permission of solving enterprise-level problems. There's lots of stakeholders, there's a committee that has to make a decision. It impacts departments outside of their purview and maybe they even lack ability to do it. Maybe they can do their little job to be done, but not the entire enterprise-level integration. 

(00:13:55):
In my Amplitude example, yeah, I can drop an SDK in my product area, but how do I convince entire product to adopt Amplitude and put an SDK on every single interaction across the entire app? There is different level problem statements, and this is where product-led sales is either can be a truly organic motion where people raise their hands, they submit sales forms and there's already a need, a desire, an understanding of it, or end user might hit friction points. Product-led sales has to bridge those friction points by either attracting the right decision-makers to the process so they can find an enterprise buyer out there. They can understand who's the champion and what their capabilities and what their permission levels are. They can create a committee for the decision.

(00:14:46):
There is... They almost slap a bandaid on the problem of people not be able to and not wanting to necessarily resolve the problem on their own. They can be very powerful with that as well as marketing because we cannot forget about marketing where they can educate of how to help people bridge that gap and how to sell things internally.

Lenny (00:15:06):
You mentioned this idea of enterprise-level problems. It might help if you give an example or two of what those might be. Then, also, just what are examples of companies that are doing enterprise or product-led sales well just to kind of give people a mental model as you're talking about some of this stuff?

Elena Verna (00:15:22):
Sure, so let's go through a couple of them. Let's go through Miro. Miro is an online whiteboarding platform. What is individual problem that people come to Miro to solve? They have a workshop they need to facilitate. Maybe they need a board to just do brainwriting in and they use Miro for individual jobs to be done. However, what Miro is designed for is a team-level problem. I come in and I bring you in and we collaborate together, so now there's two, three, four people involved, but even that is still on the project level, it's on the team level. Nobody's going to pay a hundred thousand dollars to solve a team-level small problem that is solving. What is the enterprise-level problem? It's increased innovation, it's increased productivity across the entire team because now we have this new outlet in which we can collaborate. 

(00:16:10):
Now, can Miro very clearly show increase in productivity across the organization by using the product? No. Can sales tell the story? Yes. Miro takes you from an individual user to a team step, and then sales bridges the gap to an enterprise. Let's give another example of Figma. In Figma, I come in as a designer and I just need a better way to capture feedback from my stakeholders, a more scalable way to capture it so I can iterate on the perfect design. What is it at the team level? Now there is a team that can collaborate with me more openly. I can capture more feedback from more stakeholders faster and get the project done sooner.

(00:16:53):
What is it on the enterprise level? Well, on enterprise level, our designs are just better fit the business needs. They have faster turnaround time and our product is performing better. That's an enterprise-level value prop and, again, we're, I think, in the product development space gotten a little bit lazy of actually showcasing that enterprise value in product. We rely on excellence of sales team to tell that story. I do hope that changes, by the way, in the future, that we put more pressure on the products to take it all the way up the escalator so we don't have to be a hundred percent dependent on the sales team going and showcasing that story. The product can really empower that escalator from the starting point till the end on its own.

Lenny (00:17:42):
I want to dig into that for sure. I know that's something you just shared on LinkedIn recently and I thought that was a really interesting topic, but before we get there, let's talk about this bridge a little bit more. People might be listening to this that are maybe a product-led growth company and they may feel like, "Hey, wait, we're already doing this. We have this product-led growth motion, we have a sales team. They figure out who to talk to." What exactly is in that bridge that makes product-led sales so interesting? I imagine it's like helping you identify who to go after, helping people go further and further and escalate it themselves. How do you think about that bridge between product and sales?

Elena Verna (00:18:15):
Let's talk about how product-led growth companies start with product-led sales. It usually starts by an organic demand from a user base. They reach out to them through support channels by just pinging people who work at the company saying, "Hey, I want to purchase this for my entire company." That's an organic pool that you start feeling from product-led growth model into enterprise sales world and, by the way, you should never hire any salespeople until you feel that pool because if nobody's asking to purchase, then you cannot just hire an SDR and make a purchase happen. You need to see those hand-raisers, you need to see those people demanding an enterprise-level adoption. Then, you hire starts hiring salespeople to actually suffice that demand and that's great, and you're starting to do sales and surfacing really addressing organic demand within your product.

(00:19:11):
That organic demand very quickly dries up if you rely on hand-raisers of your champions. If you rely on having enterprise buyers in your user base that are asking to just sign on the dotted line, then you have a very limited ceiling for your growth because what majority of the usage transforms to be is to have product qualification that there's a meaningful sales conversation that could occur based on the signals within usage that the buyer is missing. 90% of product-led sales is converting the usage into an opportunity by finding a buyer outside, by finding the decision-maker outside. This is where marketing and sales are so crucial in the process. Connecting that decision-maker to the usage and then driving an opportunity through sales funnel all the way to closed one deal.

(00:20:08):
It's great when you start having sales team and you're surfacing this organic demand. That's beautiful and power to you. Just it doesn't last very long just because end user fundamentally does not equal enterprise buyer and that organic demand ends up plateauing very shortly because you cannot just make enterprise buyers happen from your users.

Lenny (00:20:31):
If a founder is listening to this right now and they're like, "Okay, so I have maybe a product-led growth component, they're self-serve, maybe I have a sales team, maybe I don't," what's a sign that your product is a fit for investing in product-led sales? Essentially every product-led growth-oriented company should be eventually investing in this area. Or is there certain companies that are like, "No, you don't need to worry about it, just stay product-led growth forever or just stay sales-led growth forever?"

Elena Verna (00:20:57):
To have product-led sales means you're going upmarket-

Lenny (00:21:02):
Mm-hmm.

Elena Verna (00:21:04):
... period. That means you going for contract values that are probably over your sales floor, so the minimum that the sales is willing to engage and close, which is traditionally around $15,000. If you're going for contract values of $15,000, that means you're probably trying to close a hundred, $200,000 contracts as well. Who can handle a hundred, $200,000 contract? It's not going to be a small startup. It's not going to be an SMB. It's probably going to be higher end of more of a mid-market segment, so 200 employees-plus. More likely it's going to be towards the enterprise segment of a thousand employees-plus. 

(00:21:45):
If you are not ready to go upmarket, I would say keep it easy on the product-led sales because sales means quotas. Sales means large contract values. Sales means you are going upmarket whether you like it or not, and some products, they should stay in the prosumer individual space. Maybe they're geared towards contractors or freelancers or squarely towards startups. Those persons are not interested in talking to sales in the first place. They have much lower bearing of how much they're willing to spend, so their price sensitivity is much higher. They prefer to do all self-serve in the first place, so it's really need to be conscious about what that will do to your go-to-market motion because it definitely skews it and pulls it up. 

Lenny (00:22:36):
Got it, so what I'm hearing is that if you're starting as a self-serve-oriented product and you're starting to maybe hire for a salesperson, is the approach start approaching it from product-led sales motion versus now we're going to add the sales independent team that's kind of doing their own thing?

Elena Verna (00:22:55):
Right, so there's two ways to get to product-led sales. First little wave is that we talked about, I start as product-led growth company. I really started with this individual use case and I'm escalating to a company-level value prop and this is what I need product-led sales for. On the other side, I might start as a top-down sales traditional organization, so I have product that I only sell through sales. Those are usually anchored at larger segments in the first place. In order to build a top-down sales engine, you're most likely going after enterprise segment of a thousand-plus employees or maybe upper mid-market of 500 employees-plus. The reason to go into product-led sales is either your existing top-down motion is not working because customers need to see value before they sign the contract. They want to see that usage and at least the first signs of perceived value before they sign on the dotted line.

(00:23:49):
Or you're going downmarket and your fixed cost of sale that you have from the traditional sales motion does not scale. It stays fairly constant, yet your contract values are starting to drop as you're doing downmarket, so you want to create a lot more automation in the selling process to remove as many as possible humans out of it. You can approach it from both ways. Adding PLS on top of product-led growth or adding PLS on top of existing sales-led growth. For PLG, you're going upmarket by adding PLS. For SLG or sales-led growth, by adding PLS you're going downmarket.  

Lenny (00:24:27):
Awesome, and we're going to talk about how to actually build this infrastructure and what's required, but it reminds me one of the biggest takeaways from our first podcast and something I've quoted many times now, is your bet that every sales-led growth company needs to add a product-led growth element. Otherwise, they'll be disrupted by someone that does. Is that still your perspective?

Elena Verna (00:24:49):
Absolutely. Now, I think there's different stages of, what does it mean to add product-led growth elements? I think every sales-led company should be putting pressure on product to assist with the sales process. That does not mean that there is product-led growth, but there is a product assist in the existing sales-led motion that can materialize into product-led growth if you can truly solve for self-serve activation, self-serve engagement, and have product be able to sell itself. The biggest difference here that starts to come in, and that is so apparent in every single company, is that in B2B, unfortunately, we've let go of the products having accountability over monetization model. We've gotten into the spiral of product just builds a product and it throws it over the fence to marketing and sales to sell.

(00:25:38):
Marketing and sales have done an incredible job over the last couple of decades of coming up with these stories and elaborate playbooks of how to attract enterprise buyers and how to sell them this product. Product literally only obsesses after contract is closed and there's usage that starts materialize after contract close. We've alleviated our product management in B2B from monetization ownership. When a SLG company actually goes into product-assisted tactics or product-led growth, the biggest pain point is actually educating product team on how can you get product to sell itself, which is all about monetization awareness, monetization friction of conversion to get into the paid plan, and then having actual correct value metrics that are understood self-serve by the customer.

(00:26:29):
I mean, yes, I agree with you. Every single... I agree with myself, so I should say that every single sales-led company should at least add some product-assisted tactics, but I would even take it further that every sales-led company should start educating and putting pressure on the product to own monetization components of the business.

Lenny (00:26:50):
Let's pull on that thread a little bit more. What does that actually look like? Does the head of product for that or the head of product or specific group PMs, let's say, have revenue goals and responsible for P&L and things like that? Or what does that generally look like when they start to own revenue?

Elena Verna (00:27:08):
There's two ways that you can own revenue. Revenue stream one will be your self-serve revenue, and if there's self-serve revenue, that means product is selling literally itself, so yes, there has to be somebody in product that has self-serve revenue target. 

Lenny (00:27:26):
Hmm.

Elena Verna (00:27:27):
Now, a lot of times it doesn't fall in the core product managers. A lot of times it falls on the growth team, and that's because core product management is really focused on feature deliverability and just that incremental expansion of the core use case, and growth product management owns the product distribution strategy. Then, the PLG case, it would be a true self-serve monetization model. Now, when it comes to PLS, you don't own revenue target in my opinion, but what you do own is the pipeline that was created by product that you have a handshake with sales team over.

(00:28:02):
What that materializes in is product qualified accounts, and it's actually a product threshold of engagement that differs from activation and it differs from core engagement. It's what volume, velocity, feature breadth, or behavioral signals that account is throwing that says, "Hey, right now is the time to engage with sales." That is the bridge to monetization, that product team should own as a... even on the core team in order to drive a healthy, predictable, and sustainable pipeline to sales. 

Lenny (00:28:38):
Okay, so this is a really important topic. There's this concept you just described, product qualified account. It might be a good time to define a couple other acronyms and kind of compare them. THere's PQA, there's PQL, product-qualified lead. There's marketing-qualified lead. Can you just maybe describe the suite of acronyms? Then, I want to follow up on the PQA because that seems really important.

Elena Verna (00:28:59):
I'll start with PQA just because we just breezed over it. PQA is product-qualified account. It's on account level, it's aggregation of multiple users that are using the account. It might be on the overall logo level, so let's say you've attracted a company, so you qualify PQA across the entire company usage, or it might be on a specific team or workspace level depending on what is the better predictor for you and who the sales team is going to be engaging with. Product qualification is very much product metrics. It's the volume of use, it's the velocity change. For example, yesterday I've been adding one user per day and then today I've added 15 users to account. That's a velocity change that you need to pay attention to. Or there is a feature usage that can be highly correlative to enterprise interest. That product should be driving towards every single account reaching in order to qualify them for sales conversation.

(00:30:00):
Now, within the PQA, there may or may not be PQL, so PQL is a product-qualified lead. Lead assumes there is a person in the account that I can go and sell to. Now, leads are those buyers. They're those decision-makers in the account, and if you have a smaller segment, so for example you had more in small businesses or lower end of mid-market segment, you may very have PQLs in there because user is maybe equals buyer. User can make those buyer decisions. However, the more you move up the market, the more end user is many steps separated from the buyer, so you might have very healthy usage and you might have a PQA that is off the charts, but you don't have a PQL in it.

(00:30:47):
If you just stick your sales against that account, you're going to have a very terrible situation and very terrible user journey where users are like, "Why is sales talking to me? I have no decision-making power in my organization. I love the product, but please leave me alone." This is where you get a bunch of cold outbound, and I put big quotations on outbound emails that are just not getting returned. You need to very clearly understand who's your buying persona and, are they in your user base? If they are, you have a PQL. Pass them, go for it, but if they're not, go find it out there. This is where MQL concept really comes into play because then marketing has to still qualify a lead to bring it and connect it to PQA. PQA can have a PQL as a user already in the user base, or you might need an MQL with marketing or sales, bringing their lead over and connecting them with the usage.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Amazing, so we're going to share a link. You have this awesome visual that shows kind of like the funnel of PQAs and PQLs funneling into sales along with marketing qualified leads. Basically there's a kind of instead of one path to sales, knowing who to talk to, now there's two. Product is funneling you people that are qualified, and then marketing following you people that are qualified.

Elena Verna (00:32:06):
There is a third path. There might be a marketing funneling people that have no usage whatsoever and that is a true top-down lead, so you have three buckets of lead attribution that is coming in. I have usage and one of the users is my lead. I have usage. I have no lead in the account. Marketing is bringing me the lead, but I have to leverage that usage against that lead or have a lead coming through, there is no usage. I have to sell the entire thing still to them, so there's no context that I can use of existing usage. Those three channels are super important to identify. They all have very different conversion rates. They all have different playbooks of how you close them and, honestly, they require often different sales team to go after them because it's a very different sales enablement. 

Lenny (00:32:51):
You remind me of... You have so many hilarious memes that you share on LinkedIn. By the way, everyone listening should go follow Elena on LinkedIn and subscribe to our newsletter because it's hilarious and also informative. It's a magical combination. One of my favorite memes of yours is The Shining one that we just kind of touched on where someone's-

Elena Verna (00:33:09):
Oh.

Lenny (00:33:09):
... just using a product for five minutes and then, "Hey, do you want to," a sales guy just reaches out with the ax, "Hey, do you want to chat?"

Elena Verna (00:33:18):
That actually... It's painfully true. That's one of my most highly engaged memes that I've put out there. I have also one of the urinals where the man-

Lenny (00:33:28):
Oh, with the [inaudible 00:33:29].

Elena Verna (00:33:28):
... using the urinal and then like one comes over. A salesperson comes over. "Would you like to chat about our-

Lenny (00:33:33):
Right-

Elena Verna (00:33:33):
... "enterprise plan?"

Lenny (00:33:33):
... it's like 10 urinals and he's right next to yours. 

Elena Verna (00:33:36):
Yeah, exactly, so the piece here that a lot of companies miss, unfortunately, is that they jam product-led sales into a traditional top-down sales playbook. Now, what does that mean? In traditional top-down sales book, an MQL that you have or a lead that you gather already is in consideration cycles for your enterprise-level offering. However, in product-led sales, a new user that signs up, they know we're close to enterprise-level consideration. They're just trying to complete an individual job to be done. They're not solving a problem for their company. If you can imagine, it is like a very large funnel. You start with just users looking for problem solve. Then, you transition to awareness, consideration, and intent channels for team level problem. Then, you escalate for awareness, consideration, and intent channels for enterprise-level problem.

(00:34:41):
Top-down sales process goes after the bottom of that funnel where there's already an intent to solve company-level problem versus at the very top is where product-led growth starts on individual-level problem. It's a different timeline. If you go after individual user that just signs up for the account and you reach out to them 10 minutes later after sign-up asking, "What's your budget and are you ready to buy?", it's a complete mismatch of where they are in their consideration journey. You cannot consider a new product sign-up an MQL in the traditional sense. They're just not there yet. They have a fraction of the enterprise problem that they're solving and they're not ready to buy.

Lenny (00:35:26):
That's especially annoying because there's so many SaaS products now and everyone is coming for you, especially if you're at an awesome company that they're trying to sell, so got to be [inaudible 00:35:34]-

Elena Verna (00:35:26):
Yeah, I mean-

Lenny (00:35:34):
... [inaudible 00:35:34].

Elena Verna (00:35:35):
... anytime I even started... I remember I started at Amplitude when I started a year ago, it's like my inbox was just filled with like, "Now you're doing this, now you're doing this. Buy, buy, buy." I mean, I don't know, I can't even notice anything in that outbound [inaudible 00:35:52] unless somebody reaches out to me with something authentic that is already usage- based, it's ignore.

Lenny (00:35:59):
It's going to get worse with GPT-oriented cold outbound emails. Oh my God.

Elena Verna (00:35:59):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:36:05):
This episode is brought to you by rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone, and if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are a nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from Bitquery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter.

(00:36:52):
Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into Rows. When you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:37:17):
Okay, so let's shift to actually, how do you actually do this? How do you actually build a system of product-led sales? I feel like there's maybe three buckets. There's, what data do you need? What infrastructure systems do you need in place? Then, what are the people you need in place and how do you resource it? Maybe let's start with the data. What sort of data do you need in order to do this well?

Elena Verna (00:37:36):
There's different levels of scale on how you should be attacking this problem. First of all, it starts with just top-down intuition. What are the signals that you're seeing around the accounts that are highly correlative to sales being very excited-

Lenny (00:37:56):
Hmm.

# Superhuman's secret to success | Rahul Vohra (CEO and founder)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Let's talk about product market fit.

Rahul Vohra (00:00:01):
You have to deliberately not act on the feedback of many of your early users, and this is at the same time as listening to people intensely and building what people want. That's what we're here to do, is to make something that people want, but it can't be all people. And the question becomes, how do you listen to them? And then even of what they say, what do you pay attention to and what don't you? The trick here is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You're not doing what a lot of CEOs think they need to be doing with their time. A lot of CEOs think they need to spend time on hiring or org building and you intentionally, "I will spend time on product and marketing design."

Rahul Vohra (00:00:36):
This is a technique that I call the switch lock. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. How can we capture that? So I came up with the following idea. What if I just did whatever the heck I wanted?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
What's the most pivotal moment in your career, in your life?

Rahul Vohra (00:00:58):
I learned the real secret behind virality. There is no such thing as a truly viral product. What then is the true secret? It is-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):
Today my guest is Rahul Vohra. Rahul is the founder and CEO of Superhuman and one of the most thoughtful and insightful and articulate founders that I've met. As you'll see in our conversation, it's hard not to be captivated by Rahul's storytelling skills and also his really insightful takes on how to build great products and teams.

(00:01:32):
This episode is for anyone who's looking to build their product taste, help their teams move faster, learn how to think better from first principles. And also learn about Superhuman's very unique approach to building their company, including why they manually onboarded every single new user for years and why they decided to stop. Why they ignored most of their customer feedback on their way to finding product market fit, and also how you can use his approach to finding product market fit for your own company. Also, the power of game design in building great products, a very contrarian take on pricing strategy, what Rahul has learned about building scaled products on top of AI and LLMs and so much more.

(00:02:07):

(00:05:04):
Rahul, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Rahul Vohra (00:05:07):
Hello, hello and thank you for having me Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:10):
I have so many questions for you. We're going to have so much to talk about. I actually want to start with your time before Superhuman. When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you, what's the most pivotal moment in your career in your life? And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company Rapportive to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life and just why was it so pivotal?

Rahul Vohra (00:05:37):
So for folks that don't know, Rapportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people look like, where they work, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile and everything else that they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling in BD, super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I then ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. That by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career, prior to starting Superhuman.

(00:06:22):
Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with. Because I reported to LinkedIn's head of Growth, Elliot Shmukler. He was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to when I joined, north of 250 million members. And during my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint, it's not about viral mechanics. Overall that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:02):
Okay. Well, I have to follow this thread that you put out there, what the secret is to virality. What did you learn there?

Rahul Vohra (00:07:08):
Well, in my first one-on-one, I sat down with Elliot and I said, "Hey, I'm here to learn. Please teach me everything that you know about virality." And he said, "Okay. Well, hate to burst your bubble, but there is no such thing as a truly viral product." I said, "What do you mean? How do you explain Facebook for that matter? How do you explain LinkedIn?" And he said, "What I mean is, no app has sustained a viral factor of greater than one for any real period of time." Even Facebook in its heyday had a viral factor of about 0.7. And he told me that lasted for perhaps a year, so one person was creating about 0.7 new users.

(00:07:57):
I double-clicked again and I said, "Well Elliot, what about the address book import?" This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book, and then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn. And he said, "That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time." So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4, and that's considered good.

(00:08:28):
 0.4 is good for a viral feature, 0.6 is great, something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere up with Facebook at that time. So I said, "Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to Peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding. Which actually makes sense, it would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?" And he said, "It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product." That really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
Wow, you're such a great storyteller. I'm just listening here, just captivated, "What is he going to say next?" That was fascinating. I actually have a post that I'm going to link to that, that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled, Virality is a Myth mostly. It's based, I forget, on this book where they do all this research on actual viruses. It turns out they're not actually spreading in this exponential way, there's one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.

(00:09:52):
That's actually apparently what the data shows. I'm curious if you found this same thing, which is, when people think of an app as going viral, it's one person with a massive platform sharing it and their audience adopts it and that's just one to many and then it just happens a couple of times and it looks like it's going viral, but it's a person to many people, not many people to many people. Thoughts on that?

Rahul Vohra (00:10:14):
Yeah, we've definitely found that there are whales, to use the gaming terminology, that one person is going to be responsible for inviting 25, 50, 100 people, and they may have various motivations for doing that. In Superhuman, as an individual subscriber, if you refer somebody else and they sign up, you both get a free month, which is a great incentive if you're paying out of pocket.

(00:10:39):
We have people who send many, many hundreds of invites and there are some people who essentially have free Superhuman for life now due to how many people they've invited. But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product, so you have to then come up with new motivations for those people. That's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last, probably about two years.

(00:11:15):
Early last year we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea is, we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default, Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack, was still firmly stuck in its single-player origins.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):
I want to come back to something that you mentioned that I didn't come back to you that I think is really core to what you just shared, which is word of mouth being so important. People talk about all these viral features and sharing contact books and all these things. And your point is, that takes you to a place, but really what helps a consumer-ish product spread is word of mouth, people sharing with each other. Which, then the question is, how do you do that? We're going to talk about a lot of things that you did to make Superhuman something people want to share, but in the end it's just making something people want to share. That's the definition almost. Then it's like, what makes people want to share stuff? It's amazing, it's helping them, something that is remarkable.

Rahul Vohra (00:12:22):
Well, it turns out, because you mentioned remarkableness, that is one of our core company values. If you think about what a company has to do, it has to grow. How do things grow? Well, let's take Elliot's advice at face value, and I believe it's true, it's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something remarkable, and you used that word, and that is one of the core values of Superhuman.

(00:12:53):
We have, create delight, create something that is so joyful that really truly brings people delight. We have deliver remarkable quality, something that is so striking, so compelling and worthy of attention that people can't but help tell others about it. Then we have build the extraordinary, which is a measure of the efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. That's another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
I didn't know that was one of your values. That makes so much sense. Okay, we're going to come back to that, because I think that is... There's so much to learn about how you think about product and how you think about building the company that builds the product. But I want to actually start here with how this conversation came to be.

(00:13:41):
The CEO of Product Hunt, Rajiv, tweeted months ago, he tweeted this and we're going to show this if you're on YouTube, "Superhuman's product velocity feels like it's kicked into another gear as of late. Does anyone else notice this?" I saw that, I'm like, "I completely have noticed this. It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just a new company." And I tagged you on the tweet. I'm like, "Hey Rahul, what's changed?" And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's a lot to learn about what you did.

(00:14:12):
Because a lot of companies are in this phase of just, "Things aren't moving as fast as we want. We used to be so much faster, we used to ship all these features and now we don't." So I think this is a really cool real case study illustrative example that we can analyze. So let me ask you this, what did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster?

Rahul Vohra (00:14:37):
I think what we noticed was this sentiment, and we felt it first ourselves, but we also started hearing it from the market, from our users, from our customers, that we'd slowed down. And as a founder, as a CEO, that's the absolute last thing you want to hear. It's our job after all to speed things up. When I ask people what do they mean by slowing down, they didn't mean the product, of course, the product wasn't working any slower, but that the pace of delivery seemed to have slowed down.

(00:15:09):
I think to break this down, it's important to start by defining what we mean by a slowdown. There's the kind of slowdown that is unavoidable in certain spaces, and then there is the kind of slowdown that is quite avoidable. We actually had both. So starting with unavoidable slowdown, you can classify anything that you build in a company into one of two categories, solution deepening and market widening. Now, solution deepening means making your product better for its existing users, but not making it available to more users. Whereas market widening means making your product available to more users, but not making the product itself any better.

(00:15:50):
There are some spaces, there are some markets, there are some platforms where market widening is really fast and really easy, and there are some spaces, email is one of them where market widening is really hard and really slow. But when we started we had a great deal of focus. We only supported Gmail, we were only on the web. In those early years, we could pour every ounce of R&D energy, every engineering dollar, into solution deepening, making the product better for existing users. And of course users loved it. It's how we got to product market fit. It's how most startups do.

(00:16:24):
But at a certain point, almost every company then has to start investing in widening the market. For example, the market of people who will use a new Gmail front end but without a mobile app, does exist, but it is relatively small. This is something that every new email startup is going to learn sooner or later. In order to keep on growing, you are going to have to need to add an iOS app and then a MacOS app, and then a Windows app, and then an Android app. Then you'll soon want to support Office 365. But that's not one thing, that's actually three things, because you have to support Office 365 on desktop and then on iOS and then on Android. That's all much easier said than done.

(00:17:04):
I think we at Superhuman now know things about these APIs that literally no other company knows, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. So fast-forward to today, and Superhuman now works wherever you do on every combination of Gmail, Outlook, Mac, Windows, Web, iOS, Android, and this actually turns out to be a really great technology moat. Almost no other email app can claim this. It's taken many years of intense investment. I think we'll touch on this later, but it's one of the main reasons why we can sell into the enterprise, because we now know everyone can use it.

(00:17:37):
But this is the hard part, when you're doing that market widening, you're not solution deepening, so your perceived product velocity may decrease. You can avoid some of these things with some smart technology decisions, but mostly you just have to grind through it, and it is worth it to get to the other side. Then there's the kind of slowdown that is avoidable. If I remember my answer to Rajiv's tweet, that was the kind I was talking about. In that case it was our management structure, or who does what.

(00:18:07):
When we hired our initial executive teams, I followed very conventional wisdom. I ended up with a set of VPs and eight, I think direct reports, maybe even nine. I thought that's what you were meant to do. That's how startups are meant to scale. But as anyone who's been there knows, eight direct reports is a lot. It's a lot of hiring, it's a lot of goal setting, it's a lot of OKRs, it's a lot of accountability conversations, and fortunately also it's a lot of firing. No CEO ever gets their executive team right on the first try. That time I had for the things that I think I can genuinely be world-class at things like product and design and technology and marketing, that all began to rapidly disappear, and as a result the organization began to slow down.

(00:18:54):
Unfortunately, I was also tracking my time very closely, I had this crazy way of tracking it. At one point I noticed I was spending six to 7% of my week on these areas, these areas where I can truly be world-class at. So I had two realizations. Number one, as CEO, once you get to a certain scale, and we were definitely at that scale, you can actually define what you want the role of a CEO to be at your company. And number two, the Superhuman opportunity deserves everyone who works at the company to spend as much time as possible in their zone of genius, so that includes me as well as everybody else. What I did is, I hired a really great president, I went from eight direct reports to two, and the amount of time that I spend on product design, technology and marketing went up from six to 7% to about 60% to 70% of my week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):
Just to mirror back a few things. One is, people may feel like you are not shipping as much as you used to because you're actually building things they don't care about, which is support for office and all these things that they don't need, but the business needs to expand, integrations with Microsoft and Android and all these things. I think that's such a good point, that it looks like nothing's happening when there's a lot of good stuff happening for other users that aren't you.

(00:20:15):
Then there's this point about people delegate. Then a leader of delegates, hires all these execs and they're like, "This is not what I wanted. Why have I done this?" And you think it's going to speed up, but it slows down. A couple threads here that are really interesting. One is this time tracking thing, I need to know how do you do this? The fact that you knew seven to 8% or whatever the number is, to that granularity of your time you're spending on things you wanted was that low, how do you do time tracking? Let's not go super far, but just what's your approach?

Rahul Vohra (00:20:48):
This is a technique that I call the Switch log. It's born out of the observation that your calendar says what you thought you were going to do, but it's really only your trail of work that describes what you actually did. So how can we capture that? And actually, how can we create a system of work that isn't tethered to a calendar, where you aren't at the behest of what some timetable says you do or you don't have to do? So I came up with the following idea, what if I just did whatever the heck I wanted? What if every single time I change task I just Slack DM'd my EA, but this also works in Slackbot, it just has to go somewhere. I Slack DM'd my EA and I said, "TS:," and then a few words for the task I was doing.

(00:21:45):
Well, that would create certain changes. Instead of having to constantly look at the calendar and think, "Oh, should I stop this task, start that task, I can just do what I want." If what I feel right now is, "Oh boy, I really need to prepare for Lenny's podcast, I'll go ahead and do that." And if I get bored or distracted eight minutes in, which sometimes happens because something else just bubbles up to the top of my mind, well, there's a reason that my body is bubbling it up to the top of my mind. I also practice transcendental meditation, so I'm very keen on the idea of being aware and listening to what's bubbling up.

(00:22:20):
So it's okay for me to then go and attend to that thought as opposed to start to expend my focus points or my discipline or willpower on the thing that I thought I was meant to be doing. All I'd have to do is I'd go back to Slack, "TS: Dealing with this other thing." And by the way, you should obviously turn up for your meetings. I'm not saying just blow through your meetings and not turn up for your one-on-ones. Definitely do those things. What I'm saying is, do what feels right for as long as it feels right to do. Then at the end of the week you can see where your time is going.

(00:22:55):
I realized at one point that I was spending only in those days 5% of my time on recruiting, whereas perhaps I should be spending 20 or 30% or more of my time on recruiting. But the biggest thing was, I saw I was only spending six to 7% of my time on product, on design, on technology and marketing. These are things where I know I'm really good at them. I should either be teaching people how to do them or doing them or some combination of both. That's probably the best thing for me. It keeps me really happy, very joyful, it keeps me sharp, but it's also scaling the organization. So that's how we had that kind of an insight. Once you have this Slack Log, you can then graph it and chart it and see where your time is actually going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
How cool. Clearly this is an app opportunity or an agent opportunity where you're just telling this thing every time. It's essentially tracking context, which we're always hearing, try not to avoid context which switches.

Rahul Vohra (00:23:50):
I think context switches are fine. There's definitely this idea that, for every interruption you have, the brain does take roughly 21 minutes on average to recover, to get back to the efficacy before that you were disturbed. It's a big deal, of course, I'm building productivity software, we designed Superhuman to minimize the amount of distraction and disruption that's possible within the app. But if you are working on something and at the back of your mind something bubbles up, you have to attend to it in one way or the other. Sometimes I just write it down, actually, I don't have my notebook with me, but it's really big. I have a gigantic, whatever twice the size of A4 is, I guess A3 sketchbook and I always have a 4H pencil, so whenever one of those thoughts comes up, I just scribble it down. Or I actually stop what I'm doing and I attend to that task, because there's a reason it's bubbling up right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:44):
I love that you know exactly the type of paper and pencil, 4H pencil, A3 paper, [inaudible 00:24:51]. Okay, this is going to be a theme. You mentioned meditation, you said you do TM, so you do 20 minutes in the morning, 20 minutes... Do you do it that style or you do a longer session?

Rahul Vohra (00:25:01):
I do about half an hour in the morning, including rest time. The physical rest component of it is very important to me. So it's 20 minutes of the actual meditation, then 10 minutes of rest. I do that in the morning as well as in the afternoon at around 3:00 PM

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
And you just carve that out in your calendar. Everyone knows Rahul at three o'clock, he's going to be out.

Rahul Vohra (00:25:17):
Absolutely. My EA knows, they're the one who's organizing the calendar and making sure things happen when they need to happen. They also know that nothing can override this TM block. Without it I genuinely start to fall apart. But with it, I'm able to access some very deep competencies that I didn't have before. I've been doing this now for about four or five years, and initially I simply felt happier, occasionally even more euphoric coming out of a really great meditation session. But over time I found that my ability to focus was increasing. I could hold attention on something for much longer, but I also was able to become much more creative and much more expressive.

(00:26:02):
These are well-known side effects, as it were, or intended effects for some people of TM. And interestingly about TM, if you compare it to other forms of meditation, they don't have quite the same impact across quite as many executive functions. So there's something particularly interesting that's going on with transcendental meditation as opposed to other forms that folks are still trying to unravel and figure out.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
If folks want to, if they're inspired and they want to check out this form of meditation, any advice on where they could go learn?

Rahul Vohra (00:26:32):
Absolutely, a lot. But in summary, have a coach teach you. I had many false starts myself with meditation, trying the various apps, learning from books. None of it really worked for me. What worked was having one-on-one teaching from someone themselves who had been taught one-on-one the Yogic or the Raja tradition of teaching. This person in particular had also been a venture-backed founder multiple times over, so they're very well aware of the kinds of stresses that I tend to be under. And all of his clients are mostly in technology as well. If you're in the Bay Area, this person's name is Laurent Valasek. They run an institution called the Peak Leadership Institute. And this is all about how we can live a more integrated and whole life. Integrating wellness practices like meditation, but for the purpose of unlocking peak performance in life and in business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:31):
Thank you for sharing that. That is very actionable. We're going to link to that in the show notes.

(00:27:35):
Okay. I'm going to try to bring us back on course. The other thing you mentioned that I think is really interesting is hiring a president. A lot of founders and leaders might be hearing this and be like, "Going from eight reports and doing all these things I don't want to, spending most of my time on the product and design and marketing, amazing." What did this president take off your plate and what is their responsibility and that allowed you to do the stuff you wanted to do?

Rahul Vohra (00:27:58):
The biggest thing was taking off the operations and the management of the executive team and the rest of the company. Think of the president role in Superhuman as an operationally extremely challenging and a very growthful role. It is perfect for someone who wants to go on to be a CEO in their next role. Instead of hiring and firing that team, instead of managing and setting their goals, instead of the accountability conversations, someone else who's now doing that.

(00:28:35):
In addition, because that's not the only job, in addition, they're also a very strong thought partner when it comes to corporate strategy. When it comes to, where do we take act one, our email product? How far do we go down the multiplayer path? How aggressively should we lean into AI? What's a reasonable gross margin in a world with AI? Are we from a financial perspective okay dipping now and then coming back later? When should we start building our second product? How do we think about our R&D strategy? Should we keep on hiring in the Bay Area, or as we've done for many of our recent hires, should we continue hiring in Latin America? Should we consider other time zones as well? And so on and so on and so on. I'm just randomly coming up with questions, but the list is truly endless.

(00:29:27):
Another way to think about it is, it's almost like a grown-up co-founder. The two people I co-founded the company with, Comrade and Vivek, they've long since gone from Superhuman. We're now a 10-year-old organization and I'm one those rare founders that is persisting and thriving actually 10 years in. That said, the journey never gets easier, it gets different and you still need that co-founding energy around you. I have a handful of people in the organization who are in their roles providing that kind of energy, that kind of input, and who thrive off doing so. Then the president role is definitely one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:07):
Incredibly interesting. There's so much there. One, just a couple of things I'll share and then I want to move on to a different topic. One is just, it's cool the solution to helping you move faster and do the work you want to do is org design. That feels like a really doable thing. If you're finding you're not spending time on things you want to spend time on and things aren't moving as fast as you want, it's essentially you can find people to take on things that you don't want and shift the way that the org is structured and that could solve a lot of problems. That's what it did for you. Then I think it's also really interesting, there's this lesson here of as a founder, if you're just feeling depleted or just don't have the partner you want, you could bring someone on that could be that person.

Rahul Vohra (00:30:50):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
Okay. There's so much there. That was much more of a rich area than I even expected. I want to zoom out a little bit, and there's a couple themes that came up again and again when I talked to folks that you've worked with, investors in Superhuman. The two themes are contrarian thinking, in terms of building the company, and strong attention to detail. Let's spend a little time on attention to detail. Like I said, this is one of the things that came up again and again when I was asking people about you. So I have this quote from Ed Sims, and maybe your first investor. Were they your first investor?

Rahul Vohra (00:31:27):
Yeah, that there's a bunch of people on Twitter who are going to fight for that. But to set the record straight, Ed Sim did actually write the first three checks into Superhuman.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
First three checks? At subsequent rounds.

Rahul Vohra (00:31:38):
Well, yeah. Quick sidebar on that, he runs Boldstart Ventures alongside his partner Elliot Durbin. They have a particular interest in backing second-time founders, but they'll also back first-time founders, and they love application and infrastructure areas like Superhuman, so we were like the perfect investment. He also wrote a check from his previous fund into a Rapportive, and I think I'd made him five X that money. Nothing to write home about, but definitely, "I'm going to back this guy again." So I went to him and I said, "Hey listen, this is going to sound crazy. I want to take on Gmail." He said, "Do you have a deck?" I was like, "Yeah, here it is one slide, here it is." And there was a screenshot of Gmail with most of it scribbled out, "I want to build that and it's going to be amazing."

(00:32:25):
So he said, "Cool, we're in. Can I wire you the money?" And I said, "No, I don't even have a bank account yet." I come back two days later with a bank account and he's like, "Cool, I want to wire you 750 K." And I said, "I don't even know what I'm going to do with that money. I'm not paying myself, I won't for a while. We don't have any employees. I can't think of anything I want to spend it on. Tell you what, I'll just take 250 K." And he was like, "What?" I'm like, "Yeah, I'll just take 250 K." We start having the conversation around venture economics. I'm like, "Yeah, it's fine, we'll figure it out." Then a few months back I took another 250 K and a few months back I took another 250 K as I began inventing ways and finding channels to deploy capital properly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):
I love this story. I love all these stories you're sharing I've never heard before. And by the way, it is awesome. We're talking about him coming on the podcast, maybe breaking our VC rule. So specifically the story he shared with me that is maybe an example of you and your attention to detail is, he said that you created your own font because existing fonts weren't good enough. Is that true?

Rahul Vohra (00:33:31):
Kind of. Okay. The font that we use today is a modified version of Adelle Sans. The story there is, I looked at all of the major font families, and honestly none of them was what I would call truly excellent. That may sound like an odd thing to say. So let's, if you will permit me to talk about typography and email-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Please.

Rahul Vohra (00:33:56):
The first thing we did was, we took our UI and we laid it out in about 15 different styles using examples of the major font families. We actually printed these out and we left them on a desk in the middle of our office. Sometimes with design, you want to tune in to your immediate most visceral response, but sometimes you want to truly let a design marinate. And this was the latter. So we let these designs marinate, we let these font choices percolate. Like I said, none of them was truly excellent.

(00:34:31):
Number one, I was looking for a font that was in and of itself gorgeous. Number two, I was looking for a font that could also convey a message of any kind, without overpowering the sentiment of that message. For example, does the font work when this is inviting you to a party? Many fonts, including almost all serif fonts, are actually too somber or too sober for that. Or to pick another extreme, does the font work if it is informing you of somebody's passing, many fonts are just too jaunty for that. You wouldn't want that kind of message in Comic Sans, for example. And number three, I was optimizing for a font that made reading speed and comprehension really fast. And number four, I was looking for a font that made email addresses themselves look great. So I discarded all the 15 because they weren't good enough, and after searching high and low, I came across a font called Adelle Sans, which is designed by a foundry called Type Together, type-together.com. They have a whole bunch of lovely fonts, go check them out.

(00:35:36):
And if you go through my list, number one, Adelle Sans is gorgeous. I think each character is a work of art. It's beautifully formed. Number two, Adelle Sans is, I would say upbeat, it's optimistic, yet it's serious enough to convey any kind of message. It has just the right amount of personality, yet not too much personality. Number three, Adelle Sans is also unusually narrow, and that actually fits email particularly well. One of my pet peeves with Gmail, which by default uses Ariel, is that the lines are as wide as your window. So if you're in a wide screen, then the lines get really arbitrarily long. The problem with really wide and really long lines, is that they decrease reading speed. Because by the time you've reached the end of one line, your eyes have lost track of the start of the next line. And Ariel itself has fairly wide characters, which further exacerbates that.

(00:36:30):
So at Superhuman we, if you've used the product, you know this, we fix the line length or the typographical measure to the optimal length for reading speed, which depending on the font is around 90 to 120 characters. And Adelle Sans is quite narrow, so it actually lets us do this on quite small windows with fairly dense line. So we get a lot of information on fairly small windows without getting a very long typographical measure, optimizing for reading speed and for comprehension. Then number four, finally Adelle Sans has very unusual treatment of the at symbol in an email address. It actually puts the base of the A in the at on the same baseline as the rest of the text.

(00:37:15):
So for example, if your name has an A, my name does Rahul at Vohra, three A's and or two A's and an at, they're all actually on the same baseline. It's a small thing, but it makes the email addresses look incredibly natural. If you look at that and then you actually look at email addresses laid out in other fonts, those other the fonts look really clunky and awkward because the A is kind of shifted around and it just looks a bit silly in my opinion. Now Adelle Sans isn't perfect. So we then worked with a type designer on some of the specific details that there are some of the glyphs, which get a little pinchy as it were, and what we use today is very close to retail Adelle Sans.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:55):
And this was pre-launch or this was after you'd already launched?

Rahul Vohra (00:37:58):
We'd probably had about 10, 15 users at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):
So I think that's pretty contrarian unique to be this focused on the font and the typeface before you even launched. This was like, "Is this even going to be a thing? Will anyone even care?" And I think this says a lot about the way you think about product.

Rahul Vohra (00:38:17):
Oh yeah, that thought never crossed my mind. I think we'll probably come to it later, but the idea that, is this never going to be a thing? I think that's a dangerous thought. We can't start thinking that way, because at what point do you stop second-guessing yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:35):
Interesting. So you were confident this was going to work, so because I am so confident it'll work, I need them to get this right. There's also this trap founders fall into of just spending too much time perfecting a thing that never works and there's always advice launch early, launch often. Thoughts there? How do you find that balance? What's your advice there?

Rahul Vohra (00:38:57):
How much to spend time ahead of launch really does depend on the markets and the structure, the nature of your business model. For example, let's say you are building a marketplace in a greenfield opportunity, so imagine the Lyft or Uber in their heyday. There's a strong network effect, because the more cars you have on your platform, the shorter waiting times are, therefore people are going to preferentially use your app versus the other person's app. That's when there's no time to spare, that's when you probably shouldn't even be sleeping. You're going to hire the most aggressive maniacal people possible. You're going to work 120-hour weeks, because every marginal minute actually does matter. Every marginal minute in the market, growing compounding is going to make your next year even better.

(00:39:51):
That's actually not true of all startups and it certainly isn't true of something like Superhuman. Yes, working harder is always better and we work tremendously hard at Superhuman, but not to the point where it made sense to release something that didn't work. I'm reminded of a story of a founder that was in Y Combinator, told me about their demo day experience. They used Mailbox, which some folks may remember was also a startup, and Dropbox famously acquired them for about a hundred million dollars. The reason that they were well known, apart from the acquisition, is they were the first to popularize, swipe to archive or swipe to mark down, which of course is now standard in Superhuman and every other app.

(00:40:43):
This founder was using Mailbox and was having an amazing demo day. They're working the room, they're meeting investors, they're pitching their photography app in this case. He went home that night and went to his laptop, fired up mailbox and sent off a bunch of follow-up emails. He waited the day, didn't hear back, he waited two days, didn't hear back. On the third morning he figured something was up, so he fired up Gmail, went to his sent mail, and you guessed it, there were no sent mails there. So something had broken with mailbox. So he's cursing to himself trying to remind himself everything's going to be okay. Sent all the same emails from Gmail manually and they all came through.

(00:41:37):
But then one of the investors said, "Hey, by the way, you might want to check your email clients, because I've been getting some of your emails twice." Now he goes back into his Gmail, he sees that yes, actually the original emails that were queued up in mailbox have now indeed been sent, and some of the investors, and unfortunately most of the investors he actually pitched twice. Now, is this the end of the world? No, an investor can overlook that. Probably a good thing that you're trying new apps. But was it horrifying and was it really scary? Absolutely.

(00:42:08):
Imagine this wasn't investors, imagine this was a customer, someone who you were trying to convince to buy your thing and that you knew what you were doing and you had attention to detail and you had everything just buttoned up and under control. Well, now you've lost face, now you look foolish. That's why when you have mission-critical products like email where you are interfacing with customers, with candidates, with investors, it turns out to really matter. Email is mission-critical. It's not something where you can simply launch with a half-baked product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
This is such an important nuance take on, there's always this debate, how much to focus on craft and user experience, how much to focus on time to launch and get it out and speed. What I'm hearing here, which I completely agree with is, it depends on the market you're in and the criticality essentially of your product. So if it's email, it just needs to work and you need to get that right, you need to spend all the time, you need to get that right.

(00:43:03):
This reminds me of something else that when your early investors shared with me, Bill Trenchard from First-Round Capital. He talked about how speed was the thing that you just dialed up as a lever to 11. That's where you just, "We will make this the focus. Speed, speed, speed." I think maybe the lesson there is, you pick the thing that you think will most differentiate you, make you significantly better than what's out there. So just thoughts on how you decided speed was the thing you were going to obsess with, and advice for folks that are trying to decide where to dial up things to 11?

Rahul Vohra (00:43:37):
Bill is right and I agree with him, you have to pick something. Knowing what to pick is the trick. In the early days of Superhuman, I read a book on positioning that really influenced my thinking. It is, I believe called Positioning the Battle for Your Mind. It struck me how the most well-known brands have stood for one clear thing, they have a clear position. So in order for Superhuman to be memorable, I believed that we needed to occupy a clear position that was unique and which was available and which reinforced our product strategy.

(00:44:12):
In the first year of Superhuman, therefore, I interviewed hundreds of potential customers about their experience with Gmail and with Outlook. And predictably, almost everybody says that email takes way too much time. But interestingly, many people also said that Gmail and Outlook were way too slow. That was how I first thought that speed could be an interesting position for us. I then asked myself, "Is the position of speed unique and is it available?" And the answer was overwhelmingly yes, because almost no software was being sold or has ever been sold on the value proposition of speed. The last time I could remember anyone trying to do this, was when Google launched Chrome, and obviously that went incredibly well for them. You may remember they had slow-motion videos where they were comparing Chrome render webpages and showing that was faster than an actual strike of lightning. No one had done it since then.

(00:45:15):
I then asked, "Well, does speed reinforce our product strategy?" And again, the answer was overwhelmingly yes. I knew that our competition was not going to be startups, it was incumbents. And I also knew that incumbents generally struggle with speed, because by definition they have massive scale and usually entrenched architecture. Then finally I did what I call the cocktail party test, which is to look at the cocktail parties and to watch how people pitch your product to other people. In our case the pitches were simple. People would say, "Dude, you have to use it, it's really fucking fast." And that's it. That was the pitch. That's how I knew that speed would be a really great position for us to start with.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:08):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:24):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema of FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:47):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema. Not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:46:59):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:19):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's one OneSchema.co.

(00:47:33):
The next area I want to spend time on and I imagine we'll have much insight is, some of the contrarian ways you approach building Superhuman that a lot of companies never thought about doing that you did that worked out for you. So the first is manually onboarding every single new user. Sure, startups have done this, founders bring on some folks and then cool, show it to them and then they stop doing that and then it's self-service or sales teams. How far did you scale this manual onboarding phase of your company? How many people did you have onboarding people, how many people did you manually onboard?

# The rituals of great teams | Shishir Mehrotra, Coda, YouTube, Microsoft

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I generally value the reference check over interview signals. If I had to stack rank in interviews, what is the best signal? The reference check is the top of the list. Those people, they worked with this person sometimes for years, their knowledge, what you're going to get out of 30 minutes of artificial scenarios it's just like never going to compare what a good reference check will give you.

(00:00:25):
Shishir Mehrotra is the co-founder and CEO of Coda. Before starting Coda Shishir led the YouTube product engineering and design teams at Google, where he spent over six years. Before that, he spent six years at Microsoft. He's also on the board of Spotify. As you'll hear in this episode, Shishir is an incredibly deep and very first principles thinker on all kinds of topics. And in this episode we cover growth strategy, specifically a framework that he calls Blue Loops and Black Loops.

(00:00:51):
We talk about the rituals of great teams, something that Shishir has been passionate about and has been collecting from all of the best leaders in tech for the past two years, and which will soon turn into a book. We talk about Eigenquestions, which is not a German game show. He shares how he evaluates product talent and gives some really great advice on doing reference checks. We go into so many other topics, this is the longest episode that I've recorded yet, and you'll see why. Shishir is so full of wisdom and we could have kept going for at least another hour. And so with that, I bring you Shishir Mehrotra. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?

Casey (00:01:29):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. So they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode on so many more things. Coda is giving listeners this podcast, $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny. Hey Ashley, head of marketing and flat file. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (00:02:38):
At least 40%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
And how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (00:02:43):
Well based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (00:03:17):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of flat file. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:34):

Shishir Mehrotra (00:03:48):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:49):
I don't think I've actually shared this with you, but you're actually the very first CEO that I've had on this podcast. I actually have a rule of no founders or CEOs on the podcast, at least at this point. And you're the first person that I've let break this rule. And so how does that feel?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:04:04):
I've always been a rule breaker.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:08):
Perfect. So bio for listeners just briefly. So you're the founder and CEO of Coda. You spend six years at Google where you're a VP of product and engineering for YouTube, basically leading the YouTube product team. Spent six years at Microsoft, you're on Spotify as board of directors, you're also a prolific online writer. And that leads to my first question, which is I hear that at Coda there's a contest internally for people who actually... So maybe a little context, you encourage people to write a lot of stuff externally within Coda. You want people to be writing and you have this contest of who gets the most views and likes of people internally. And so is that true and who's winning?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:04:47):
By the way, yes, it's true. We did a similar thing at YouTube and YouTube creators. I mean obviously kicked our butts, but we made a good way to make sure we understood our tools and learned how it worked. And I think for a while at YouTube I had one of the top videos, it was a really cute video of my daughter taking everybody's orders when she was like three or four years old.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:11):
That's not fair.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:05:12):
Yeah, super cute kid is an easy trick for YouTube, but I get to learn all the tools and so on here, the equivalent at Coda is you can publish Coda Docs, they show up in the gallery coda.com/gallery, you can see lots of them. And at this point, thousands of docs when published from lots of different people, it gets millions of views. And like at YouTube, the most popular ones are not ours, but it is sometimes helpful for us to make sure that we understand how the whole system works in order to do it. So I think that the current winning doc at Coda is one in a pretty deep niche. It's from a guy named Kenny Wong on our data team, and it's an orange theory workout doc. So it turns that orange theory has this deep subculture that they all hang out together on Reddit and so on. And this doc just took off as... I don't really understand the doc, I'm not in that subculture, but it's similar to YouTube in some ways. It's like the niches are actually much bigger than people think.

(00:06:17):
Of the ones that are more work related, I think Lane Stock on two-way writeup still outranks all of mine, but I have a couple of good ones on there too. And I would say this competition exists in my family too. I don't usually even win with that in my own family, my older daughter, Annika, who also had that great video on YouTube has two docs that do really well. One is Family Quarantine Olympics, which is a thing she put together at the beginning of COVID, like a fun game for families to play. And the other one is a score tracker for a game called Ticket to Ride, which I don't know if you've ever played the game, but it's...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
Heard of it.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:06:51):
It's about the most complicated scoring system on the planet because you play the whole game and you spend 10 minutes scoring it. And she built this whole scoring calculator and that turns out to be super popular too. Anyway, but my docs do okay. But yeah, the interesting variety of what people end up doing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:07):
I love that. Which of your docs has been the most successful? Hopefully we end up talking about it.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:12):
I think it goes back and forth between two docs I've written one called Eigenquestions, which I think you intend to talk about, so we will get back to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:20):
Yeah, absolutely.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:21):
And the other one is one I wrote a while back called Four Mitzvot Bundling. That's all about how subscriptions work and it's how I ended up on the board of Spotify with Daniel and I geeking out on bundling theory, which is a super weird hobby, but I have normal hobbies too. But I liked it. I like to explore bundling as a fun hobby and people enjoy that doc as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:41):
Yeah, you've shared a lot of good thoughts on that and we're not going to cover that because covered that in depth in many places. But just to clarify, did you write that doc and then led you to being on the board of Spotify or is that after the fact?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:07:52):
The conversation led to... It was a napkin sketch at YouTube that turned into a really fun lunch I had with Daniel, Daniel at the Spotify founder and CEO. And then he encouraged me to write it down. And for me, you write prolifically and writing for me is actually surprisingly hard. I feel like I have to think about it.

(00:08:22):
You make it seem really easy. For me he's like, "Could you write that down?" It's like, "Great. Now I'm going to take a year to write this thing down." Because you think through each part of it and you kind of come up with the right framing. I have a little review process I use for my docs that allows other people to help me make it better, which is always really helpful. But yeah, so that's how that started. So it got written down after. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:47):
So we were talking about writing and content and things like that, and that's a really good segue to the first thing I wanted to talk about, which is Black Loops and Blue Loops, which to folks that haven't heard this before might sound like some ultimate fighting nightmare scenario, but it's something that is really important to you and Coda. And so to set it up, can you just talk about what Black Loops and Blue Loops are?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:09:08):
Yeah, and it's probably worth mentioning. I think a lot of businesses have a diagram that describes their ecosystem and how it works. Sometimes it happens a little later in a company's journey. For us, we're probably three or four years in before Matt Hudson's runs our data finance teams here. He came up with this diagram and it really stuck for people. But I highly encourage drawing a diagram like this for your business. I'll flash it up on screen for a second and I'll describe it, but this is what the diagram looks like, black loop, blue loop, and it's basically the two different ways that our product spreads. The Black Loop is someone comes in, they make a doc, they share with a group of people, some subset of the people turn around and make another doc, and the process repeats itself over and over again.

(00:09:53):
The blue loop is someone comes in, makes a doc, and instead of sharing it with a team or with the collaborators, they publish it to the world. And in that process expose it to, they can choose how it should appear. What publishing in Coda is a lot like building a website. So you pick a URL, you tell us whether or not Google should be able to find it show up in the gallery and so on. And what ends up happening from that is they turn into broad promotion of Coda, but really it's about that person what they're trying to get done. And I'll stop sharing so I can talk a little about the dynamics. So I sometimes refer to them as the Microsoft Loop and the YouTube Loop because those are two inspirations for it. The Black Loop feels a lot like how documents naturally spread.

(00:10:36):
The viral actions of a document platform are shared, create, share, create. It happens over and over and over again. The best way you learn about Office or Google Docs or so on is somebody shares one with you and you're like, "Oh, that's pretty cool. I bet I could create one." And that loop can happen very, very quickly and it really drives for us a lot of how we think about how we work mostly within companies and teams, but sometimes across them as well. And so for an example, it led to our pricing model. So our pricing model is a little different than most companies in the space that we do a thing called Maker Billing. So basically all document products, all products with the document metaphor have three personas, people who can see things, people who can change things, and people who can create new things.

(00:11:18):
Basically everybody charges for the top two. They charge for editors and makers. If you can make changes then you have to pay. And that's like every document product you can think of, including ones do drawing or so on. They all do the same thing. And we decided that we're only going to chart for people when they make a document. So you think about it, you get a Coda doc, you only need one If you are using any of our paid features, you only need one paid license for doing it. And the reason we do that in terms of that diagram is I wanted no friction on the share edge. I mean the share edge for us is like that's the moment of, "Hey look, I'm doing this thing, it's so cool." And that's the moment where the line I gave to the team is I want no dollar signs in the share dial going into that, every product has its moment of how he's for growth.

(00:12:04):
And going back to YouTube, imagine you had to pay for people you shared with. Nobody would ever share anything. But that's how basically every productivity product works is the moment they charge you is when you share with somebody. The Blue Loop, I often call the YouTube loop because the emotions of publishing a doc are incredibly close to that of publishing a YouTube video. And people have all sorts of reasons why they do it. I mean sometimes people do it, there are people who do it for money, but a lot of people do it for exposure, for brand building. They just want to get an idea out in the world. They want to get feedback. Some people do it for fun, some people do it as a charitable contribution. There's lots of reasons why people do it, but the net effect of what happens is for YouTube, the vast majority of how people found out about YouTube was through a video that was shared with them.

(00:12:51):
That's sort of the impact, but it changes the dynamic that allows everyone who publishes a Coda doc, now it's a very natural incentive to go share it with the right population. If you're an orange theory, you share it with the orange theory population. If you're into plane ticket to ride, you share it with the ticket to ride population. But if you're into bundling, you try to find a small group of people that care about bundling, tell them all about that. And what happens for us is that then becomes a loop. That means that most people's exposure and almost a third of our users come through this loop. They're not actually exposed to Coda, they're exposed to a great idea for how to run an offsite or how to win ticket to ride or whatever it might be. And in that process, they learn about the product. And so then they come in through this vehicle.

(00:13:45):
And one reason it's very important is because for products like ours that are very horizontal, you get different types of users. There's some users that I call the building block thinkers, they like to build up from scratch and the blank surface of Coda is really amazing for them, but for most people that's intimidating. I don't really know what to do. Most people in the world are problem solvers. And so they start not by, "Do I need a new document?" They start with, "I've got a problem, we don't make decisions fast enough at our company," or, "My family can't figure out what to do on the weekend," or whatever it might be. And then when they find a solution to that problem, they then pick the right tool. And so the blue Loop allows us to go after that and it changes how the motion of the ecosystem works as well. But that's what Blue Loop and Blue Loop is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:31):
Awesome. I have a bunch of questions I want to ask. The first is for founder listening to this and they're like, "Oh man, what am I loops? What's my flywheel? How do I think about my business?" Can you talk a bit about how you came upon this way of thinking about the company? And then also how do you structure your teams to work in this way if this is the way you're thinking about growth?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:14:50):
Maybe on the first part, and I think you just hosted Casey Winters, he is pretty famous for talking about loops, not funnels. And I do think there's a very natural thing when you're building a product or building a business to think about your funnel and you think about things as being linear, that somebody comes in, they go up to your signup process and then they see your onboarding and then they get exposed to the first magic moment in your product and the second magic moment, so on.

(00:15:13):
But the truth is, it doesn't really work that way. Almost all products have some form of loop. That person turns around and maybe sharing is built right in your product or maybe it's not, or maybe there's a way that it happens through advocacy, but understanding that the way products actually grow and spread happen through some type of loop not funnel, is I think pretty fundamental. So first piece of advice I'd give is you probably do have a loop. Whatever the product is, there's probably something about it that causes that loop and understanding how that works really important. I mean in terms of what it is. In our case, I'd say if you take Black Loop and Blue Loop, the Black Loop is every product in our category has that. We didn't invent it. You build a document, you put a share button on it, every product has that.

(00:16:01):
Sometimes it's just recognizing what's there. It's not that interesting. The Blue Loop on the other hand, is not something that every product in our category has. It's not really a thing that you expect to do with Google Docs or Office or so on. It's our unique take on, "Hey, we're going to build a publishing platform that isn't just for sharing ideas and building things with your team, therefore putting things out in the world." I mean, one of the best compliments we hear about the Coda Gallery is I had this user tell me, this line I really love is said that the Coda Gallery feels halfway between Medium and an app store. And you can come and you can read about anything interesting in the world and you can go shopping and say, "I need one of those. I need one of those and I need one of those."

(00:16:40):
And it's my view that this category, we call the all-in-one doc category, I think this is going to be critical. I don't think that there's enough people out there that are looking for a horizontal new blinking cursor. I mean, they exist and you can get through your first million users that way. But I think to get to the level of impact we want to have, we've got to find this problem, see here. So you probably have a loop, not a funnel, and it might be hiding in plain sight or it might require invention. That's the bounder dance and the fun of it, but finding it, writing it down I think is really helpful. Second part... Oh, how do we organize team?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:18):
Yeah, but let me ask one quick question. You said this, I think it was a data scientist that first imagined and diagram this out because I'm curious, as a founder listening, they're like, "Oh, how do I find something like this?" I imagined part of this was, "Oh, this person brought you this interesting way of thinking." And there's this process of, "Oh wow, this is cool. Let's think about this." What was that like? Just over high level, that process.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:17:41):
He currently runs data and finance for us. He's actually one of the early founding members of the team, Matt Hudson. So he is getting every job here around the go to market team. Very insightful. But honestly, the idea can come from anywhere. I mean there's a really famous loop diagram for Uber that I think one of the board members drew it or Travis drew it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):
Built early.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:18:01):
Yeah, right. Yeah, that napkin sketch, who knows how true that is. Probably lots of dispute on that. I think Airbnb had a similar diagram. I'm trying to remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:12):
We tried, we had some sketches.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:18:15):
Right. So it can come from anywhere. I do find that the most natural place to see it is just when you're talking about your business to someone, when you're pitching a customer or a candidate, I actually think candidate... I think we're going to talk a little bit about energy, but I think talking to candidates is one of the best ways to hone what your business is about. Because those people are in some ways even more critical than investors. I mean they're investing their time, not just their money. And so your ability to get across to them why this thing is going to be interesting and how it'll grow.

(00:18:50):
And they're the most discerning investors out there in a lot of ways. And they're actually not that easily confused by metrics and so on that could be temporary. And they put themselves in that picture like, "Can I see that happening?" And so for us, the black loop part is pretty obvious, but the blue loop part, you had to squint a little bit to think, "Will people really do that? Will people come and publish these documents like some hybrid between websites and blog posts and templates? What are they going to going to do and why?" And so it required a little bit of creativity, which forced me to get better and better at pitching why that's going to happen and what that role is going to feel like. And this analogy of halfway between Medium and an app store is that helped people crystallize what that promise has to feel like. So I think that... And this idea can come from anywhere, but if you want mine for your own loops, go look at what you told the last few candidates you talked to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:48):
I like that. And then just take some attempts at drawing some kind of diagrams. That's how I thought about that when I was thinking about it. Do you find that the quality of user is different amongst the loops? I imagine one is like 80% of the growth, but maybe the other is a different type of user, maybe higher quality. I think about a little bit with Airbnb referrals drove higher quality hosts, even though it was still a small portion of all hosts. And so it was a really lucrative and interesting channel. Do you find anything like that?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:20:14):
So I mean quality and activation are a little bit different. I mean the Blue Loop definitely, there's actually three entry points on that diagram. Those people come through the Blue Loop, those people get shared through the Black Loop and those people come through the top of the funnel. There has to be like your seat population, somebody starts with blinking cursor. Nobody shared anything with them. Either a Blue Loop, a template to document or Black Loop a way the team is running. If you look at activation, retention, so on, certainly the highest is the black share. Somebody shares the document and says, "Hey, this is how we're running the staff meeting." You're just going to use it. So the job or retention there is a all different, and actually one thing that is... Actually, let me come back to that evolution. Second best is through the blue loop and then the third, the worst, the hardest is activating through the very top. And from there, roughly one in five people make it to what we think of as our activation moment, which is hard.

(00:21:14):
It's like you're going to hand somebody a new product that they didn't start with a problem on and nobody handed them a document to say, "Just work in." That's hard now. Now all our flows are really important and so on. But if you think about these three different dynamics from how you asked about how you struck your team, they're incredibly different mindsets. Because coming to the top of that diagram, we get to own the conversation. We have our opportunity to tell you what the product's about, what you should do with it, here's the minimal set of things you need to know in order to be productive and gradually reveal the other things that you might need to know, meaning the order of those things wrong, real trouble. But it's actually a minority of how people get exposed to Coda because in the black loop, the person who owns that conversation, the person sharing the document with you. If that person does it and mispositions it or doesn't just makes a crappy document or so we have to help them onboard their users, which become our users.

(00:22:11):
Same thing in the Blue Loop, that conversation is now owned by the publisher. They're really not that interested in teaching anybody about Coda. They're mostly interested in here's this really cool way to do Orange Theory, or here's this interesting way to run a meeting. And so, one of the interesting things about building platforms, which I think is a little bit different than products that get to be direct. For better or worse, most of the products I've gotten to work on are platform products. And I find that there's two very different kinds of people that like that challenge. So some people, and I think Steve Jobs was the quintessential example, if he didn't really like being a platform, the iPhone ship without an app store, they locked down the screws on the back on all the devices that nobody could open them. And his viewpoint was, " I'm going to control every element of what my users see." And on...

Shishir Mehrotra (00:23:00):
I'm going to control every element of what my users see. And on the other hand, platform thinkers, you sort of assume that my connection to my eventual user is through someone else. Like YouTube, regularly they come to work at YouTube and somebody would say, "Well, here's what happened last night." And sometimes it's heartwarming, like, oh, my gosh, this kid bit this other kid's finger and it took off like crazy and this Korean pop star just broke through the billion view mark before everybody else did. And sometimes it was not heartwarming and you don't get to control that because that's part of being a platform.

(00:23:37):
And so it does change how you think about the way you run the team because if you have a loop where your community ecosystem users on control that narrative, then you have to incorporate that. Another close analogy I think is Airbnb and the famous story of them taking pictures of people's apartments. It's like they had to reach out and try to control that and eventually you can't do that. You had to sit back and let people market their hotels. And thankfully the ecosystem got good at it, but they kind of had a similar dynamic, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):
Absolutely. With Airbnb, pricing is even more of a challenge where a lot of hosts don't really know what to price. They think their place is worth a lot more and we can't tell them the price. There's laws around that. And so it's like, hey, maybe you want to price it at this rate if you know what's good for you. So it's a lot of encouraging. So yeah, I've seen that in action. So you talked about teams and how you think about structuring them a bit and that's a good segue to our second topic, which is around a book that I hear you're writing called The Rituals of Great Teams.

(00:24:40):
And I think what you're doing there is exploring rituals that have emerged at some of the more successful companies. And so just a question there, one, how'd you get interested in rituals, so much so that you decided to write a book, which is such a trudge and endless amount of work? And just yeah, where is it at, how's it going? And then I'll ask you a few more questions there.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:24:59):
The writing a book, so I'm writing this book, it's called Rituals of Great Teams. And when I signed up to do it, I thought it was going to take six months. I'm now almost two years in [inaudible 00:25:11] my manuscript in four months and I am probably half done. So there's a lot of work ahead of us in building, but it's one of the most fun projects I've ever done. So the history behind this was, as in many cases, is a lot of sort of odd luck and happenstance. I got hosted right at the start of the pandemic. I was interviewed for a different podcast called Masters of Scale by Reid Hoffman. And the way Reid records, which I'm not sure I would recommend this, but he does it a little bit differently than you do. You sit down with no idea what you're going to talk about and you talk for three hours.

(00:25:49):
And then he has a group of editors, the same group that actually at its head, and they come in and they pick 20 minutes of it and they turn and one episode. And you have no idea what it's going to be, so you talk and talk and talk and gets 20 minutes out and they're pretty good at getting to a nugget. So they picked out of this whole discussion this part that I thought was really small and it was Reid had asked me for one of my favorite quotes and I talked about this quote from a guy named Bing Gordon. People don't know Bing. Bing was one of the founders of Electronic Arts. He's a famous investor, Amazon, Zynga, so owns lots of great companies. And I happened to sit on a board with Bing and he used this line. I think Bing's one of the best non-linear thinkers in The Valley. Always learned something with Bing.

(00:26:29):
And he used this line that really stuck with me. He said great companies has a very small list of golden rituals. And there are three rules of golden rituals. Number one, they're named. Number two, every employee knows them by their first Friday and, number three, they're templated. And he has great examples. Amazon has six pagers and Google has OKRs and Salesforce has V2MOM and there's all these different rituals that people do. And I ended up sharing on the podcast a little bit about what Coda's golden ritual is. If you were to ask a set of Coda employees on their first Friday what Coda's golden ritual is, they would almost certainly tell you about this thing we do called Dory/Pulse. It's sort of the key of how we run meetings and do write-ups and so on. It's a pretty simple idea, is that in our write-ups and in our meetings, instead of going around the room and hearing what everybody thinks, we do this thing called Pulse.

(00:27:26):
Everybody writes down what they think and we hide everybody else's until you're done writing. So you force yourself to be eloquent about your opinion, on the record about it, and unbiased. And then the second thing we do is called Dory, which is instead of randomly asking questions, we ask people to put the questions on the table and then we take a round of up quoting and down voting them to actually figure out what we're going to talk about. Dory's named after the fish who asks all the questions. It's a tool we use a lot at Google that we kind of turned into this mini tool. If you were to ask a set of Coda employees on the first Friday about Coda's golden rituals with Bing's three tests, they'll certainly talk about Dory and Pulse. And it's not because they're meeting wonks. It's because it's indicative of the culture of the team.

(00:28:08):
And so I'll regularly hear employees say things like, "I just joined Coda. It's been a week. It's amazing. The culture is so open that I got to ask a question in a meeting and it outvoted the CEOs." Or they'll say, "I got asked for my contribution to this really hard decision we're making and it was thoughtfully presented. I had space to be able to do it well without bias and it was actually read and considered as part of the decision making process." Reid's podcast did pretty well and I got all these questions about rituals and so I decided to do a dinner which turned into a dinner series. And basically every third Wednesday we would host a group of people to share the rituals with each other. And I learned a bunch of stuff in this process.

(00:28:54):
I've now interviewed over 1,000 people for this book and There's lots of really interesting rituals that come out of it, but first thing I learned is people love sharing their rituals. I've interviewed people from many companies that everybody's heard of, Nike, Disney, New York Times. It's all the way down to many startups that maybe people haven't heard of or companies in industries that people don't talk a lot about. Book authors, pundits, lots of different people that have come through this process. Everybody loves sharing their rituals. Everybody has little secrets to how they run their business, but for some reason the how we work part everybody's very willing to share. People also love hearing about them. And I was like, "Is this going to be interesting for a dinner, geeking out about how a team works?" And it turns out not only do people like hearing about it, it's the littlest details that matter. It's like, yeah, we kind of do that, too, but we have this issue.

(00:29:46):
How'd you get past this? And you start discovering that actually those little details are what would make or break a thing, that you can't quite do it the exact same way. And then the other thing I realized, which is probably the most important point, is that rituals are, I like to say that they are, a mirror of culture. That one of the attendees, Dharmesh Shah, founder of HubSpot and very thoughtful person, he talked a lot about this thing that is virtually presented as something called flash tags, which is a really cool example. But Dharmesh talked about how when we're building companies, we actually build two products. We build one for our customers and we build another one for our employees. That's actually how we work part of it. That's the term he uses for that, is culture. That's the product we build for our employees.

(00:30:29):
I think it's a very interesting way to define what culture is. Interestingly, when you ask people about their culture, hey, what's the culture of Google, or Airbnb, or so on, the way they'll answer the question is through rituals. They'll say here's what we do and the way you know this is what we do is through this ritual that's in place. So I thought that was pretty interesting. Started off just building a little listicle of here's all the great rituals and then I started realizing that actually the comparison between them is kind of interesting. And so I started sort of filling in the gaps between them of like when would you do X versus Y and what did I learn through that process? Publisher asked if I would turn it into a book and I agreed without really contemplating how hard it would be. And it's become what most of my evenings end up being on this.

(00:31:17):
I have a wonderful co-writer, Erin Dame, who's incredibly gracious with her time and helping me sort through the best ideas and the worst ideas, but it's a really fun project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:29):
What are some of the more wacky and/or impactful rituals that you've come across that you can share?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:31:36):
Boy. I'd sort it down the list. I'll tell you some that are interesting and recognizable. One of the most fun ones is from Arianna Huffington and she shared a ritual called Reset. And there's a bit of background on Arianna, she's well known for Huffington Post. She now runs Thrive. She had an accident a few years back and ended up going through a period of doing a lot of research on how the brain works and ended up coming to this set of conclusions about how you can affect your own brain chemistry. And one of the things she does as a sort of personal ritual is I think called a reset.

(00:32:13):
It's basically the ritual is you make a one minute video that is personal. And they have a little template for doing it, but it's a breathing exercise. It's like you are supposed to play it while you do this breathing exercise, but it's personal. So it's like her video, you go search YouTube for Arianna's reset, you'll find it. It has pictures of her kids, it has quotes she loves, it has videos of her hometown in Greece and so on, but the way she brought it to the team was they start meetings by randomly picking someone. They call it spin the wheel. They randomly pick someone and they play their reset. And the idea is you get this two for one where everybody gets a little bit the brain chemistry rewiring of 60 second breathing exercise. Everybody gets back into that sort of zen state a little bit and you learn a little bit about each other.

(00:33:05):
And she was saying that the pictures people pick and so are interesting, but actually the music people pick is probably the most interesting. A lot of people pick calm music, some people will pick something they rock out to, but everybody does their reset a little bit differently. So that was a really fun one. Another really fun one that I was surprised by, Gusto does this thing in their hiring calls. So you get an offer from Gusto and apparently when you get on the offer call of congratulations, you got an offer, instead of just meeting the recruiter, which is what most companies do, they have the entire group of people that interviewed you join the call and they all say something about why you're amazing and you should join Gusto.

(00:33:46):
And it's such an interesting ritual in so many ways. For the candidate, obviously what an amazing experience. To use an Airbnb term, that's like a level 11 experience of what that feels like, but also for the company. One of the questions I get asked, "What if I voted no? What if I'd said this person is a no hire?" And I said, "It doesn't matter. You're on the call, you're going to work with this person, you're going to help them feel welcome and you're going to help them understand where they stand." I think it obviously takes a bunch of time, but it also is a signal to the company of how important hiring is and something that obviously we all prioritize. Those are maybe a couple of the maybe different ones that people might not have heard of before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
Those are amazing examples. Have you integrated any of these rituals from other companies doing this research into Coda?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:34:37):
All the time and it's the cheapest form of research. I mean, I get to borrow all these great ideas from all these companies. We just added one to our decision making process. This is a good example of a little detail that really matters, is Coinbase has a ritual that's formed around ... This is a decision-making ritual they call ... It's actually amazing how many companies have a decision-making ritual with a name, with a bur. So at Square, Vocal called them Spades. He kind of verbified it. There's a template, but you use Bing's three tenants. It's got to be named, every employee knows it by the first Friday and it's templated.

(00:35:18):
So Coinbase does a thing they call rapids and rapid is a framing around what the roles in it are, the responsible approver, participating, informed and decider, but their technique of doing it was really interesting. They have this subtle nudge thing that we weren't doing that I've now incorporated at Coda. So at Coda we have Dory and Pulse, like a very common ritual. It spread through a lot of different companies that use Coda. You don't really have to use Coda to do it, but I think Coda is pretty good at it. But one of the things we were facing was that you would do this pulse and so you'd have a meeting. And if you did it wrong, it could feel like voting and it could feel like consensus building.

(00:36:04):
And so we would get this, people would talk about it and every ritual has its pro and con, but people would look at it and say very open culture, you're allowed to share whatever you want. But on the other side for the person that's trying to make a decision, it can feel like, oh, my God, I now have 30 pieces of feedback. Am I supposed to wait for all 30 of them to be yes? Am I supposed to wait for it to be a majority and how do I know? What am I supposed to do here? And so Coinbase had this really simple idea that we sort of smushed together, which was at the top of their rapids they named who all the people were and then next to each one they put a little box that said what is the decision from that person?

(00:36:44):
They just organized. It's very similar to Pulse, but they kind of organized them and said everybody that's in the inform bucket, they can comment, that's totally fine, but we really care about the approvers, the responsible and then of course the decider, the one that really matters. And so we just added a column to our Pulse, which is what is the role? And we grouped the table by that. And the other thing that Coinbase does, which it sounds really subtle and small, but really in detail it really matters, is the person running the meeting pre-fills that with what they want from that person. You are an approver. Maybe I have three approvers because I have a budget approver and I have a marketing approver and I have a sales approver, whatever it might be, and I need you to give me this answer. I don't need you to comment on everything I'm doing, but I need you to tell me do we have the budget or not?

(00:37:31):
Or I need you to tell me am I authorized to make this change in this part of the product that we generally don't change, or can I change the onboarding flow, or whatever it might be? And we took a process that I think was doing a pretty good job of getting rid of groupthink, which is really the heart of what we were doing with Pulse, but had this danger of being overly leaning towards consensus building to a fault. I think consensus building is a good thing, but consensus building to a fault is not. And we sort of stole this one from Coinbase and we switched it in and it got better. And that's a good example very recently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:05):
I feel like you have a clear bestseller on your hands here and I can't wait to read this. I almost feel like you have an unfair advantage right now having all these insights before you share them, being able to execute so much more efficiently.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:38:17):
Well, yeah, it's interesting. I'm obviously not trying to keep any of it a secret, so the whole point of publishing it is because I think other people will enjoy it and can get benefit out of it. But if people are interested, one of the other choices I made in writing this book is I decided to do it somewhat in the open. So there's what I call the rituals of great teams brain trust. And so if you just search for me and Rituals of Great Teams, you'll find it. And I'm sure we can add the link to the show notes, but you can sign up. And basically, as I finish a chapter, I put it out to the group and there's now a few hundred people that are helping me co-edit this thing.

(00:38:55):
Some of them just because some of them come in and give me help on storytelling, grammar, so on, but a lot of them are contributing where they show up and they say, "Hey, you missed this one. We actually do that, but we do this other thing a little bit differently and you should really talk about that." Because I kind of view it as it started as a dinner series. It started with everybody's going to give to each other. And so I kind of wanted to bring that into the writing process. It's also a cheap way to get some pretty good editors and it pretty helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
I love that. That is really smart. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:40:14):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:40:36):
And How have you found these rituals form for someone that's listening and are like, "We need some rituals, we need to move more effectively." How do these come up? Are they just organically organized? Do they come in from other and they evolve? Is it founder driven? What have you found so far? I know you're still working on the book, but curious.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:40:53):
There's a whole section of the book on ... I get this question a lot of how do I find the rituals we have? How do I adjust the rituals to match? Are they supposed to change? There's lots of things you see because some rituals are great when you're 100 people and they're terrible when you're 1,000. And you should actively change those things. Some are great in what sometimes people call peacetime versus wartime. You should do this during this time, but you should actively not do it when you're in this other time. And actually, that in itself is a ritual. I mean, every company has some form of a war room ritual that is ... I guess Facebook I was learning. We did a dinner last night, so I learned a little bit about it. Facebook apparently calls them lockdowns, which is a term I hadn't heard before, but apparently it's well understood. When they say lockdown, everybody knows exactly what it means.

(00:41:37):
It's like we no longer do the goal setting process, you drop this type of work and everybody just knows this is what it means. But I would say that when we talk to people about rituals, a set of rituals that happen organically. I mean, those are the easiest. Dory and Pulse for us was one of the product managers running a meeting just thought it was we're a distributed first culture, but hadn't really adapted to it properly. And this product manager is just annoyed at waiting around on Zoom for everybody to go around and say their piece and it just took forever. And by the end everybody's like, "Can we just pause? Everybody just write down what you think." And he just happened to do it in this thoughtful way and it just took off. And so some rituals grow organically and you just got to wait for them to do it.

(00:42:24):
But there are cases where companies actively form a ritual to drive a certain behavior. And the best advice I've given on this topic is to read one of my other favorite books. It's a book called Switch. It's by Chip and Dan Heath. All their books are amazing, but they also wrote Decisive and Made to Stick and Moments and so on. But this one is, if I could recommend five books, this would take two slots on the list. And the subtitle of the book is How to Change Things When Change is Hard. And the basic idea of the book is they use this analogy of a writer on an elephant on a path. And when you're trying to change things, you have three options for what you can do and it actually kind of maps to Bing's analogy. So you can direct the writer, so you can tell people what to do.

(00:43:13):
You can motivate the elephant, so you can give this thing a kick in the butt and it's going to move. You don't know exactly where it's going to move, but it's going to move. And you can shape the path. Shape the path is I'm going to set this way up so that you can only do these things. The way I think about it is direct the writer, tell people what to do. That's why if you look at Bing's tests, that's why you teach employees this before the first writing. You tell people this is what we do. And so some rituals, how do you get this ritual to work? You put it in your new hire onboarding and you make it work that way. Motivate the elephant, a lot of that's about branding. So what do you do with rituals? It's an amazing number of rituals where I'll tell people that seems like a great ritual.

(00:43:51):
I would highly encourage you to give it a name. Give it something that lets people anchor ideas to. Names a very powerful thing. If I said, "Yeah, at Coda we do voting and sentiment writing or something," I don't even know what you would say. It would sound boring. It wouldn't sound like something you could brag about, something you could form identity around. And so it's very important to give it a name. And then finally, why do you shape the path or you set things up? You templatize, make it as easy as possible to follow this ritual. And make it just a part of what we do enough, then if you're at Gusto and you're like, "I don't really understand that hiring cult thing," where it's like guess what? You're going to be invited to one soon.

(00:44:28):
You're going to see it and then you're going to have to do it. Or if you're at Square, you're going to see the spade template and you're going to learn how to do it. So I think Switch is ... I recommend this book for lots of purposes, but as you're thinking about rituals for your teams, it's a particularly relevant frame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:45):
Awesome. By the way, that's a little plug for the YouTube version of this podcast, which is now a thing we do. So if you're like, hey, I don't see what you're talking about, just search for Lenny's podcast, YouTube, and I think you'll find it and we'll probably link to the ad in the show notes. I'm also reminded of Airbnb's rituals, which you probably already know about, but they're kind of all hilarious and weird. One is formal Friday, where people dress up in suits and gowns on Fridays. Another is a human tunnel for all new employees, where every new employee has to run through a human tunnel and jump into a beanbag or something. And then there's a new hire tea time, where new hires drink some tea with some veterans and chat about where they're from and things like that. There's a bunch more, but those are the ones that are my favorite.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:45:27):
Those are great. I also included some of the level 11 thinking as well. I think that's also a good Chesky favorite. Brian also has another one that's in the book that's about how to rank your to-do list by finding leverage. That's a really fun one as well. They're like don't rank your to-do list, but a lot of people do importance versus urgency or so on. And I guess he sorts his by which of these is most likely to create leverage of getting rid of the rest of my lists, which I thought was very ... I started doing that in my to- do list and it's very interesting and impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:02):
That's actually an incredible segue ...

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:00):
... you listen, it's very interesting and impactful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:02):
That's actually an incredible segue to our next topic, which are eigenquestions.

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:06):
Ah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):
And so eigenquestions, one of your most classic posts, you mentioned this at the top, maybe your one of the most liked posts, other than maybe bundling. It sounds like some kind of German game show, eigenquestions. Can you tell us what eigenquestions are, and then I'm going to ask you a few more questions around that?

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:22):
I've thought about the German game question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:26):
Yeah, sorry [inaudible 00:46:27].

Shishir Mehrotra (00:46:29):
I didn't know this would be a very interesting game, but we could try to create one. Okay, so I'll describe what eigenquestions are, but maybe I'll start by telling you a little bit about where the concept came from. And, this is actually a YouTube-ism that... Maybe just to place ourselves in history, so in 2008 I joined YouTube. And many people don't remember this, but YouTube at the time was seen as a mistake. It was seen as Google's first bad acquisition, everything else had worked, but this thing kind of seemed like a disaster. It was grainy videos, we were losing lots of money, we had billions of dollars in lawsuits, none of it really seemed that obvious. There's lots of discussion on how to reorient it, fix it, and so on. And so everybody outside, that's what they saw.

(00:47:14):
If you stepped inside a YouTube staff meeting in 2008, actually one of the toughest questions we were answering was this question we called the Modern Family question. And it may sound small, but it actually was very perplexing. And the question was pretty simple, the question was if you looked at our search traffic at YouTube, one of the top five queries basically every week was for a show called Modern Family. And Modern Family was number one show on television at the time, by far the most popular. And we were second-biggest search engine in the world behind our parent company Google, so search traffic was very important. There was one big problem, people would come search for Modern Family, one big problem, we didn't have Modern Family on YouTube. And so we'd give them some pretty crappy responses. And the question was... And by the way, ABC.com had decided to post every episode of Modern Family live on their website.

# Lessons from 1,000+ YC startups: Resilience, tar pit ideas, pivoting, more | Dalton Caldwell (YC)

## Transcript

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:00):
Seeing everything people apply to YC with. People all have the same idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):
One of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:07):
One of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
You have this concept of tarpit ideas.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:17):
Seems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
Recently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:28):
We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
A lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:36):
A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):
Are there other patterns you find across startups that do well?

Dalton Caldwell (00:00:43):
There's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.

(00:01:50):
Why every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.

(00:02:45):
Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel.

Dalton Caldwell (00:04:45):
Yeah. Thanks so much, Lenny. I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
So to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?

Dalton Caldwell (00:05:22):
Have you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, "Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game." If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, "Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one." It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.

(00:06:33):
And so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?

Dalton Caldwell (00:07:14):
The way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?

(00:08:26):
And so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):
What's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?

Dalton Caldwell (00:09:01):
I think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.

(00:09:51):
And again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, "Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time." Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):
Yeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, "Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?" Versus, "Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup." Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, "I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed"?

Dalton Caldwell (00:10:50):
If it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):
Yeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, "What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?

Dalton Caldwell (00:12:08):
That definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, "Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing." I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.

(00:13:13):
And then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):
Wow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:14):
They thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, "We're going to build a new VR headset." And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
Wow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.

Dalton Caldwell (00:14:45):
Usually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, "You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about." And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.

(00:15:41):
In the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, "I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it." Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):
These are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, "Oh, here's a big idea." And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...

Dalton Caldwell (00:16:38):
In the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, "We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better." And then they were like, "Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations." And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?

(00:17:30):
There was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):
I think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.

Dalton Caldwell (00:17:51):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):
A big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?

Dalton Caldwell (00:18:02):
Again, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, "Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something." When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):
That is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-

Dalton Caldwell (00:19:18):
Yeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.

(00:20:29):
And they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
He did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.

Dalton Caldwell (00:20:54):
Yeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Also Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:14):
Of course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
I was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?

Dalton Caldwell (00:21:41):
Yeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.

(00:22:37):
And so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.

(00:23:24):
A few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):
This is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?

Dalton Caldwell (00:24:10):
For people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.

(00:25:10):
If you ask your friends, "Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?" They're like, "Yeah, I would love that." You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, "Oh, we're going to fix music discovery." This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
Absolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, "How's it going?" And everyone when they used it, they're like, "Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to." And then they never use it again.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:19):
Do you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):
Yeah.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:21):
Years?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):
They told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.

Dalton Caldwell (00:26:30):
Yeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):
Along these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, "What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.

Dalton Caldwell (00:27:09):
Maybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, "Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no." And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. "I need feedback." That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.

(00:28:05):
And so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, "Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget." They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, "Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no." I don't think that's how this actually works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
I think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:00):
Yeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, "Yeah." If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Specifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?

Dalton Caldwell (00:29:25):
I think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.

(00:30:34):
And again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):
It makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-

Dalton Caldwell (00:30:57):
Yeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):
I think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?

Dalton Caldwell (00:31:32):
Yeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, "Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky." You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, "Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to..." And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):
Fair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?

Dalton Caldwell (00:32:35):
I don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, "Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton." And then two years later they're like, "Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up." So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):
To make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-

Dalton Caldwell (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. "Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google." And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, "Oh wow, everything went wrong." It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):
How do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?

Dalton Caldwell (00:34:39):
I think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.

Dalton Caldwell (00:36:54):
Oh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):
I think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?

Dalton Caldwell (00:37:23):
I completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, "Yeah, we're failing." I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, "We got one more move in us. We got one more try." You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.

(00:38:17):
And so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, "Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore." And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, "I don't want to do this anymore." And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
That is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:16):
Yeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, "I'm done." If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
And you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?

Dalton Caldwell (00:39:41):
I would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, "Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in." And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):
That is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, "Talk to customers. Build things they want." Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, "Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars." Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?

Dalton Caldwell (00:40:57):
Yeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool." And I'm like, "Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?" And they're like, "Well." And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.

(00:41:49):
And you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, "Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers." Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, "Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag."

(00:42:51):
The whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):
When someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:17):
Yeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):
That's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.

Dalton Caldwell (00:43:51):
Yeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):
Makes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?

# A framework for PM skill development | Vikrama Dhiman (Gojek)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:07):
I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things. What you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:22):
Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc? You must have that impact through the artifacts that you work on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
I'm curious what you found most impedes people's career growth.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:00:37):
How you view change, whether you are focusing on things you control, and third is how you see yourself. The moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
Today, my guest is Vikrama Dhiman. Vikrama heads all things product at Gojek, including product management, design, program management, research and insights with teams across India, Singapore and Indonesia. He has previously worked at companies like Directi, Airtel, MakeMyTrip and WizIQ and is among the most well-known product leaders in Asia. When I asked people who their favorite product leader is in Asia, Vikrama's name has come up almost more than anyone else's. We chat about how to move into product management, how to be a great product manager, how product managers often shoot themselves in the foot, and so much more. With that, I bring you Vikrama Dhiman after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.

(00:01:45):
This episode is brought to you by Uizard, empowering product leaders to ideate and iterate faster than ever before with the power of AI. As a product manager, I often spend hours taking screenshots and then annotating them with feedback for my team.

(00:03:56):
Vikrama, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:00):
Thank you for inviting me, Lenny. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:03):
So as you know and hopefully as listeners know, I'm on this quest to meet the most insightful product leaders from all over the world and your name has come up more times than almost any other product person when I ask people for their favorite product leaders in Asia. And you're also the third guest from Gojek, so there's definitely something in the water over there and I want to talk about that. To just dive right in, you have a very strong reputation for building incredibly strong product talent and also design talent, and also helping people transition from other roles into product management, which a lot of people listening to this podcast dream to do. So I'm going to ask a bunch of questions around this area. How does that sound?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:04:47):
Sounds good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
Okay. First question is just when you think back to the people that have done best in the product management role and have had a rapid career rise, what are some of the most common traits or behaviors or habits that you find in these people?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:05:05):
Over the last decade and a half, I've had the opportunity to work with some really strong product managers, learn from strong product managers, and some of them have had rapid career growth. When I was younger and I was starting off, I used to think it's all about the product. If you've got a really cool product to work on, your growth's guaranteed. And if you got really a product which no one cares about or a stream which no one cares about, then your growth is going to be slightly slower. But as I started seeing more and more product managers at their craft, I saw that working on a cool product area is not the only thing. In fact, sometimes some product managers would come back and complain that despite their product doing really well, they've not really grown.

(00:05:51):
And while some other product managers whose product didn't have the impact really grew. And as I started looking at it and as I started making notes, as I started talking to other product leaders, what I discovered was that the really strong product managers who were also growing in their careers did some things differently. And based on that, I created a career growth framework for product managers, which comprises of three things, and I call it three W's. So what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? The really strong product managers are good at usually two of the three things. The ones who rise and when they are rising, they are performing well on all the three access. So if you would like, let's talk a little bit more about each one of these W's.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):
Yeah, I would love to. I love that you put the word what at the top and that makes it the three W's, which is clever because I find even if the acronym is not necessary, it's really helpful to help people remember so I totally respect what you did there. So the three is what you produce, what you bring to the table and what your operating model is. Is that right?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:09):
Yes, absolute.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
Okay, cool. Yeah, let's talk about these.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:07:11):
So what you produce, a lot of people index on the impact while and they start thinking about goals, they start thinking about direction and they start thinking about strategy. While it is important to know at what stage of the career you are and what kind of a product that you are working on, the very first thing that anyone, when you're starting off, produces is outputs, okay? The output can be launching a product, it can be analyzing and running an experiment, and it could even be just being a part of the team and contributing to a go-to market strategy. So focus on that output significantly. As you get comfortable with output and you start getting comfortable with working with different stakeholders, you start controlling what outputs are necessary, which is when you move to the outcomes. Outcomes are product areas, goals that you can own and or collaborate with other stakeholders on.

(00:08:14):
And when you start figuring out which outcomes are necessary, that is when you move to the leadership and directional areas. The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:20):
So highlighting one insight here is that a lot of advice you hear about how to do well in your career, which you pointed out at the beginning here, is it's not just not immediately drive impact. That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:09:51):
Absolutely. So outputs is shipping products, but it also comes in smaller things. For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:54):
The way I think about what you're describing, which I actually 100% agree with, is when you're starting out in your careers, execution is where you need to deliver. People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:25):
Absolutely. So focus on outputs at the start of your careers and don't forget outputs even when you grow in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):
So along those lines, just to close the thread on this idea, it's still helpful if you work on something that does have impact that matters, right? How important is that? And you said that you've seen successful product managers work on things that aren't as impactful and still do really well, but I guess would your advice be tried [inaudible 00:11:52] be in a place that is going to drive more impact versus it's not actually that important in the early career?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:11:58):
So I'll give you my example. In one of my previous roles, there were two product areas that were important for the organization. My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):
I love that. Yeah, basically when you're just starting out, just execute well, execute smoothly, ship things on time. I'm going to say a few things, but I'm curious what else comes to mind here of just what does good output look like? Is it do things that are helpful to your team and manager, ship things on time, bug-free, have a clean road map, everyone's aligned behind, [inaudible 00:13:11] deadlines, things like that. I guess what else along those lines should people be like, "Okay, here's what I should be doing to have good outputs?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:13:16):
Some of the things that I think are useful. So first, what's output? Output is something which is very tangibly defined, which doesn't take too much of your time, effort, and energy to visualize and think and strategize over and you are able to quickly get moving on. Go and ask your product leader, go and ask other leaders on what are the areas they are blocked on. Sometimes they will be blocked on, "Hey, I need to prepare this brief for this particular summit", "I need to prepare this particular slide for a leadership review", "I need to prepare a review, I need to prepare a review which has to be done with the legal." You can volunteer and definitely own and deliver the first drafts of those even if the final draft is not something that you own. That's a simple example of an output, which I feel a lot of people miss because they want to be focusing on the bigger strategic pieces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:16):
It's basically be useful. That's the way I always like to talk about this, just like your job as a PM is be useful, make your team more effective, help your company be more successful. Just find ways to be useful to everyone around you.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:14:27):
Absolutely. And be useful in doing the small things which make an impact and also contribute to your learning versus being useful in areas which you think the mini CEO should be working on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:44):
Right. There's all this talk about being an empowered product manager, building empowered product teams. I think there's an important nuance. When you're just starting out, you haven't earned the right to inform strategy and vision people. Why would people follow you at this point? We just need to get stuff done, so that comes over time.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:01):
Absolutely. And it's not just when you are starting off or when you are young. Even with if you are senior and you're starting off with a new team, even if you're starting with a new company, you need to have that mindset. And sometimes you will not know the best. And we'll talk more about how to, what is your operating model, which is how you work with others. It's a very, very important thing for you to know that you are one part of the cog wheel, you're not the entire wheel yourself. And a lot of the folklore around product managers can make you confused, especially when you're starting off in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:40):
I love it. Okay, let's keep going. Number two.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:15:43):
Number two is what you bring to the table. Now, I think how I describe that is what is your impact on impact? So the first access is impact, but you also need to have an impact on impact. And this is what I had missed a lot in my early career, that you put the coolest product areas, your product area is successful and that automatically guarantees your growth. It doesn't. You have to also show that yes, you were a useful contributor to having that particular impact. The simplest thing on this is that is your PRD quality good enough? Are you writing that the draft notes that go and circulate to the care teams, to the marketing teams and so on? Are you making sure that you are deriving from the strategy that has been shaped or you're constantly just pushing back on the strategy? Similarly, you also how you are drafting the north stars, how you are working on the experiments, how you're working on the data, how you're working on the metrics.

(00:16:43):
All these things take time, effort, and energy. And I know there is some literature and there are some operating models where people are working only at strategy levels while all of these execution of these artifacts is being done by some other people. I don't think, especially when you are starting off, that's a very, very good thing. Even when you are mid-senior, I don't think that's a very, very good thing. You have to have to be able to produce these artifacts which are product artifacts. Even if there are people in strategy creating their artifacts, even if design is coming up with a design brief, you need to have a cohesive product strategy or product PRD and work backwards from PRD and product knows yourself. These things are important to show you are progressing on four pillars, which is data and metrics, design and research, technology skills, and strategy.

(00:17:41):
Product managers constantly are evaluated on this when you interview, but you also have to demonstrate these on the jobs. And the best way to demonstrate these is through the artifacts, through the notes that you are sending. So you must have that impact to impact through the artifacts that you work on. For a lot of product managers, when I ask, "Hey, I was working on this very impactful area. I'm not able to have the impact on my career, what is missing?" And when I go and ask, "Can you show me your last PRD? Can you show me the last product note that you sent? Can you show me the product strategy doc that you have or collaborated on? Can you show me the brief that you sent to the design team on the problems and the ranking of those problems?" Usually, you'll find something or the other missing.

(00:18:31):
In cases that those are bad, you will find that the pre-iteration planning, pre-sprint plannings are not running properly. You will find that the Jira storyboards are very empty and there's just a title in the subject and nothing gets described and so on. So you'll miss all these pieces. So these are the things which you bring to the table and it's very, very important that you work on these aspects as well. Finally, we have what's your operating model, which I feel is the most important thing which you have to have to focus if you are going from mid-senior to senior level. This is essentially about communication, collaboration, organizational skills and community skills.

(00:19:16):
And across product managers, again, because of the folklore of mini CEO and others, I see that a lot of people get carried away in the way they operate as product managers with other stakeholders. There are three tenets that I define in working well as a product manager with others. Number one is raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with. Bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself. And finally, you are in charge of getting the decisions made and not making all the decisions yourself. I think as long as you follow these three tenets, you will have a successful relationship across stakeholders. These three tenets are easy to say, but they become very, very hard to embody and display on a day-to-day basis. But this is essentially going to be your struggle no matter at what level of product management you are operating at in your career or within your company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):
First of all, can you just repeat them? Because I think this is... Essentially, it's like a mantra that PMs can think back to of, "Am I doing these things?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:20:36):
So the three things which are very important for product managers to work with others and other stakeholders are raise difficult issues without being difficult to work with, bring out important topics without drawing importance to yourself, and be able to get decisions made without having to make all the decisions yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
I like this list a lot. It reminds me, there's this product leader I worked with who their team got pushed to do a bunch of stupid stuff. And he realized later that, "Hey, it's actually my job to have pushed back on doing this stuff." He was the head of product for this business unit and he realized, "Oh, I see. That's actually what I should be doing now that I'm in this role." And you sometimes forget that one, you have that influence. And two, that's something you should be doing.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:21:33):
Absolutely, absolutely. It's always within your control and it's always the things that are within your control that you should be controlling rather than focusing on the things that are not within your control and obsessing about those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
I'm so aligned with the way you think about all these things. Coming back to the second actually, just to give people something they can do with this trait. So the way I think about what you described, and correct me if I'm misinterpreting it, is there's a detail-oriented-ness, high quality-ness to the way that you should be crafting all the documents/artifacts you're creating, your one-pagers/PRDs, your roadmaps, your strategy docs, just like they should be really high quality. So along those lines, if you're an ICPM trying to get better at this stuff, how have you found is the best way to level up in these things? Is it working with your manager and getting feedback? Is it peers? What helps somebody get better at the quality and yeah, the quality of these documents?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:22:34):
What you bring to the table is one of the most misunderstood attributes and aspects of product management. On one end, you could get around and say, "Here is my PRD, here is my JIRA board, here are my stories, here is my pre-sprint planning or pre-iteration planning document" and go. It's not just about the spread and the width of the things that you're doing, but it's also about the depth of those things as well. Some product managers, what they bring to the table is arguments, what they bring to the table are debates, what they bring to the table are pushbacks, while others are able to channelize the questions, channelize the inputs, channelize the direction and convert that into strategic choices which can then shape discussions, which can then shape direction. Be the latter and you will rise faster in your career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):
So you have these three buckets of what you produce, what you bring to the table, and what your operating model is, the three W's. So let try to summarize and see what I missed and then we'll move on. So one is just focus on executing, getting things done that are helpful to your team, your company, your manager, and focus on just getting stuff out. Not so much in necessarily in strategy. Even when you're a manager and a leader and a VP, just like you're still responsible for producing things, not just telling people and being wise. Two, what you bring to the table, my takeaway here is produce high quality artifacts that raise the bar.

(00:24:05):
The way I think about this is as a PM, you want to have this aura of I got this. People put something on your plate, you want to feel like Lenny's got this, I'm not going to have to worry. It's going to be forgotten and I know it's going to be done well. And then the third piece is this idea of an operating model. Basically just make sure decisions are being made. It's not about you that you're pushing back on bad ideas. Is there anything else I missed before we move on?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:24:31):
No. I think the art of pushback is another important factor because if you're pushing back a lot and the way you are pushing back matters a lot as well. Just don't be someone who's seen as an obstacle and a hindrance and as someone who's just very difficult to work with, but rather see as someone who's able to actually add value to whatever your leader, your stakeholders, your product area demands and you are able to advance the product and the direction and execution forward. Once you do that, I think keeping that as the intent and ensuring that your team is getting unblocked and not getting to do work on anything which is stupid or is likely to be changed, then you've really got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:23):
Do you have any advice for how to pushback in a way, the way you describe it is not to be difficult to work with or without seeking importance? I guess is there words or phrases or approaches you found are effective for pushing back against ideas that you disagree with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:25:38):
What I've seen that people who do pushback very successfully and are still considered not difficult to work with, they are also able to bring the tempo of the conversation to a more logical space from an emotional space. I think that's such a useful skill and I sometimes am guilty of operating on a slightly emotional note, which is useful. Sometimes you need a war cry, you need a high pitch, you need execution on war footing. All that is fine, but it's only fine in some cases. In other cases, it's always very important that you're able to bring it down to the logical space so that a logical and a little more equal footing of the discussion can happen. And a lot of this is something that leaders need to ensure is happening, but product managers and product leaders who are working with executives who are able to bring this tempo down and bring it to a little more logical space will also do far better in their careers and they'll also have a lot more rapid career growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
So let's talk about the flip side of rapid career growth, which is career growth that stalls. And I'm curious what you've found most impedes people's career growth. What do PMs do that shoot themselves in the foot and slow their career? Any pitfalls do you find are important to try to watch out for?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:27:15):
I think part of it is on a lot of us in product leadership space. We've not done a very good job in defining rubrics, growth frameworks and so on. But even in places where growth frameworks exist, like three W's, what I've seen is that clean mindset shifts and changes can enable faster growth, but those mindset and changes also can hinder your growth, right? So the first thing is whether you are focusing on things you control or whether you're focusing on things that are beyond your control. Second, what's your relationship with change? And third is how you see yourself. The third is very, very powerful and we'll talk about that as well. The first is what you control. If you drew an access of what you control and what you cannot control, as you're starting your career, most of the work that you're doing is in what you control, right?

(00:28:15):
You are very obsessed with feedback, you're very obsessed with, "Okay, can I do this?" "Can I do this?" "Okay, I'll probably not do this. I'll probably do this", and so on. You're not worrying about the overall corporate strategy, you're not looking at what the competitors are doing, what is their market cap and all those things. You're focused a lot on your craft, you're focused on a lot on your output and you're focused on how you are growing. As you start becoming mid-senior, I see the conversation shifts from what can I do, how am I learning, how am I growing, to why is the organization not doing this for me? Why can that stakeholder not change this thing about themselves? Why do I not get to work on projects like this? Things which start going outside your control. And it is very, very important that you keep your focus no matter what stage of career you get into what you can control.

(00:29:16):
And again, it's easy to say that everything in universe should be in your control. It doesn't happen like that, but a large number of things that impact your career are within your control. And go back to the three W's that we spoke about, what you work on, what you produce or what do you bring to the table, and what's your operating model? And there is tons to do on data, tons to do on technology, tons to do on communication, collaboration, design and research, strategy and community. And you can spend years and years and years crafting those things. Focus on those things, growth will happen at every single stage. The second aspect of it is your relationship with change. Again, when you are younger, when you're starting off, rate of change is crazy. You are growing almost every six months. You are picking up skills and experimentation, you're picking up skills in how to analyze.

(00:30:15):
You're picking up skills in how to work with different kind of stakeholders. And since the rate of change of your skills is high, your rate of growth is also high. Again, as you start becoming mid-senior, I start seeing conversations on, "Okay, maybe I should not do that. Maybe I should not take on this product. I don't know what it means for my career. I don't know what it means for my growth" and so on. So your rate of change slows down. So it's very important that as you get to mid-senior level, you are constantly checking on what you can do to keep increasing your rate of change. And one of the simplest things that you can do is if you think you are four on data, figure out who. And you may be four on data out of five in data. Within your organization, start benchmarking yourself with the best in the industry.

(00:31:13):
You'll automatically see that your scale drops and as your scale drops, you start seeing what you need to improve and do. If you start seeing that on communication and collaboration, you're reaching four out of five within the PMR, start mapping yourself to other stakeholders in other functions. Again, your score will fall in your eyes and you will start figuring out what are the things that you can do as well. So keep your focus on rate of change and rate of growth will automatically take care of itself. Sometimes it also involves changing your team or even changing your company, but those should be the last results. There are significant things that you can do within that as well. One of the final things that I see which limits you, especially as you start growing in your career and you reach mid-senior levels is how you see yourself.

(00:32:04):
I see a lot of product... And I've been guilty of that. When I see that a lot of product managers, that's included me at some stage, doing these things, people will come back and say, "Oh, I am a very high agency PM" or, "I'm a very collaborative PM." Earlier on, I used to think that okay, I need to give this kind of work to these product managers. I need to fit them with these kind of team, these kind of work areas, these kind of opportunities. But then I started understanding these things are not just signaling, they are also anti-signaling. They are like, "Oh, I'm high agency. So it's sometimes okay if I'm little brash, if I cut corners somewhere, if I sometimes come across as a little rude to some people" and so on, right?

(00:32:55):
Similarly, if I'm seen as a hyper-collaborative person, so it's okay if sometimes I'm not very decisive, if I'm not moving fast and so on because I'm this kind of a PM. So it's very important that you check for what are the stories that you're telling yourself because those stories are defining you at a basic level, which is then very hard to correct through frameworks and structures. So figure out what is the story that you are telling yourself. If you are not able to figure that out, talk to the people you trust so that they can tell you that as well, and then correct those stories. And the moment you are able to correct those stories, you may be back on the growth path again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):
Wow, there's so much meat and wisdom in what you just shared. I want to go in so many different directions. Maybe just to follow on this last thread, did you go through something like that yourself where you have this sense of yourself that hindered you? Okay, awesome. You're nodding your head, if you're not on YouTube. Can you share that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:33:57):
Yeah. So I'll give an example of when I joined Gojek. The very first thing that I learned in my career was SQL and Oracle. And I was very proud of the fact that my data skills are awesome and I know several frameworks and I know several tools and so on. And when I joined Gojek and I saw one of your guests, Crystal, and I saw the work that she was doing and her team was doing and I just immediately was like, "Yeah, no, this is not... I'm nowhere near", right? And similarly, I also thought that my communication skills are really good and my product strategy skills are very good, but then I worked with people like Dito and people like Sidu who was so good at their craft that it challenged me to see that okay, what is it that I am missing? What is it that I am doing wrong?

(00:34:57):
And it auto-calibrated me in my eyes on where it was, but that also created a hunger in me that this is what I need to fix. And I immediately corrected my assessment of myself that I'm not the strongest product manager on data. I'm not the one who knows all the strategy pieces or even strategy frameworks or how to bring everything to a strategy point of view or communicate it from an effective perspective. And then I started framing I'm still in a learning phase. When I see that I'm not in that phase now, I try and make myself humble by interacting with people who are far smarter than me on different scale or reading different books, or watching podcasts like yourselves. And that keeps you grounded on the fact that okay, you are always learning. And I also found that seeing yourself as someone who's a learner is an enabling story to tell yourself, okay?

(00:35:58):
It may not be the most exciting story, it may not be the most memorable story about yourself, but it is definitely one of the enabling stories as well. Similarly, I think one other thing that I used to say about myself was more that I'm very high agency PM. But as I started working more in Southeast Asia, I learned that mindfulness is also very, very important, that not every team, not every culture will work with you in a very hyper aggressive style. But you still need to get the work done. And I'm still learning on that and therefore, I've started using a word, I don't want to be a high agency person, I want to be a mindful agency person. And so these terms are very important because these are the stories that you keep telling yourself and these also then start shaping your behavior. I do feel that I have a lot to do, I have a lot to learn on these skills, but these things definitely keep you grounded and you keep coming back to the learning phase again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:09):
It's interesting that when you saw Crystal being incredibly good at working with data, you just realized, "Hey, maybe I'm actually not very good at this." And your reaction wasn't, "God damn it, I'm really screwed and this is really depressing me", it's, "No, instead I'm going to try to get better at this." And that reminds me some of the feedback I get with this podcast, those people are like, "Man, these people are so good, I'm never going to be this good. It discourages me from thinking I will ever be super successful in this career." Clearly, you have a different approach. Do you have advice or guidance to folks that are sometimes discouraged seeing people being so incredible and helping them actually continue to level up in this rate of change you talked about versus just like, "Nope, I'm never going to be that good?"

Vikrama Dhiman (00:37:54):
I think as product managers it becomes difficult because a lot of your growth is being determined because of feedback of others. And because product management is so ambiguous and still not defined, the stakeholders can also give feedback on variety of dimensions. Some of them may not even be important enough to give feedback on, but they are important enough for them and so therefore, they give you feedback. And therefore, you have to shape that feedback in. But you also have to consider that there are these eight access that we spoke about, the data access, the design and research access, the technology access, the strategy access, communication access, collaboration access, organizational skills access, and the community access. You need to channelize feedback into okay, is this an area that you are targeting for growth or not?

(00:38:51):
And one of the most important things that I learned was that when I joined Gojek or even earlier, there would be so many different areas that I needed to improve on and still need to improve on. You can't improve on every single area. That's what overwhelms you. You need to pick which is the area which is the maximum leverage for you and improve on that particular aspect and then move on to the next area, then move on to the next area and so on. Obviously, if you are floundering in something, if you're really negative in something, then you fix that first because that will give you the highest leverage. But if you are picking up data and design and strategy and technology all at the same time, that's when you'll overwhelm you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:33):
So to summarize the advice there is one, be actually very open to feedback you're getting. It's easy to say that, it's hard to actually listen to people criticizing you and act on it. So I think that's an important takeaway here is just actually, feedback is a gift and actually understand that and try to act on it. I have a great interview with Jules Walter who's a PM at Google now, and he has this awesome quote about how whenever people give him hard feedback, it's like internally he's just melting, but that's externally he's like, "Thank you so much for that feedback, I really appreciate it. It's very valuable."

(00:40:10):
And so that's a good way to get people to keep giving feedback. Okay. And then the other piece of advice you just shared there is pick a focus area. Like say you're getting all this feedback, your strategy isn't amazing, your PRDs aren't great, just find one thing to focus on. And I don't know, do you try to do somewhat quarter? Somewhat year? Do you have a heuristic of how long to spend on one thing?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:40:31):
So different skills take different time and how you are progressing also depends a lot as well. For skills which are softer in nature like communication and collaboration and community, those are skills that you will work on all your life. You'll never achieve anywhere near two or five on five on those ever. There'll always be something that you will miss, there will always be a new context, there'll always be a new set of stakeholders, new company cultures that you have to adapt to. For others, you have to see that what gives you the maximum leverage in your career. When you're starting off, my recommendation is that you pick between data and tech one, and definitely one on design and research and strategy.

(00:41:18):
So usually, that's the combo that I recommend. My advice is if you're coming from design and research background, then you pick data or tech. If you're coming from a data or tech background, then you pick design and research, and that gives you the maximum leverage because that's a skill that you will necessarily not have developed over the years. Once you've demonstrated on two of these three, between data, tech and design and research, then you start focusing on strategy. We've had great success at Gojek in transitioning a lot of product managers, especially in Indonesia, using this framework. And it's produced a lot of good product managers for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:59):
Well, let's actually follow that thread. That's really interesting. And so the approach is you have this access of skillsets and you pick, for this person moving from say customer service to product, here's the two things you need to focus on. Can you talk more about that?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:42:15):
Yeah. For instance, we recently had two PMs, one who came from a growth background. This is actually [inaudible 00:42:24]'s team. And one from a research background. And with both of them, we use very different tactics. So we gave one of finding driver redesign, which was very much a very design-focused product, but we still had them leverage their data skills because we were able to create a PRD with incredible amount of data on exactly what different segments of customers we're doing. And that then we worked with designers on what the designs and the framework for that will be. And even now, Lenny, if you will come and see our finding driver redesign next time you are in Asia, it's a piece of art. And if you would see that that was worked on by a product manager who actually came from a growth and data background, that makes it even more special.

(00:43:13):
Similarly, the PM who transitioned from research, I kept giving feedback on technology and data skills are the ones that we need to check. And I need to hear from engineers that yes, they're able to work with her very strongly. And once she was able to do that, she's recently turned a very heated question on one of the features that we were doing into a full-blown solution with designs, with trade-offs and everything, and able to now convert it into a question for leadership on how we should be approaching this particular product and direction. So I think that's proven successful as well. Similarly, there's another person who took risk who was originally from research and again, worked a lot on our products, including our enterprise product. And she's doing an amazing job as well. Again, going through that path of okay, these are the things that you need to leverage.

(00:44:14):
The only watch-out is that it doesn't work out always. In some cases, some PMs will pick these things up fast, and it also makes a big difference if you are transitioning when you are slightly younger in your career. If you are already senior in a function and then you are transitioning, sometimes it can take a lot of time in transitioning and picking up those skills. But it's definitely doable if you get a very strong product leader working with you who's able to shape those skills for you. So it's sometimes okay to go a little slow when you're transitioning so that you're able to go faster later rather than getting faster somewhere and then being stuck there for a while.

(00:46:29):
Something that you mentioned earlier that I wanted to come back to is this confusion about what the PM role is and how that trips people up in being successful in the role and continuing to thrive in the role. You mentioned this to me offline too, that this is just something you deal with a lot, just this frustration of what the hell is this job? What am I actually responsible for? What am I not? What do you find is helpful in helping people work through that, get past that, not make that a big blocker in their career, not knowing exactly what the PM role is?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:46:56):
I think we've been in technology product for several decades now, but we are still figuring out what an exact definition of product management is. And even the strongest definitions are slightly principled and philosophical in nature, they're not very concrete, and that also means that every and different technology companies have gone through different journeys and they've defined the roles very, very differently. And even within a very large company, you will see that different teams, different divisions are approaching the roles very, very differently as well.

(00:47:34):
And on top of that, what that does is that not only internally the product managers are figuring this out, their managers, their leaders are figuring these things out for them, but the other stakeholders who have to work with these product managers are also confused and they don't know what to expect. And the number one question I get from stakeholders is, is a product manager expected to do this? Because they also don't know, okay, is this expected from a product manager or not? And my general answer to that is, if this is something which is blocking the progress on the product, then yes, the product manager should work on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):
Love that.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:48:09):
But that works if the product managers have had some training and they have had some training in working with different stakeholders and they have had something on the job. What I've figured out is that there are certain functions and there are certain disciplines which you can't define, but you can only become better at with practice. For instance, what is an actor or what is a dancer? Right? So these are things that you will get better at as you become skilled at it. And earlier, these things used to be looked at as something which is very artistic, only the people who are talented or only specific kind of people can do it. But now, each one of those has become [inaudible 00:48:57] and frameworks as well. So there are courses on filmmaking, there are courses on acting, there are courses on dancing and so on. And similarly, product management is that space as well.

(00:49:08):
So you have to understand there's an art to it and there's a science to it, but you can use the science to figure out the art. So that's the philosophical side of it. The second side of it is what we spoke about earlier that instead of figuring out what is product management, figure out what's your contribution, what's your output and figure out are you contributing on these access on data, on design, on technology and on strategy. And one of my favorite things is that if you created these four circles of strategy, of technology, of design and of data, and you created a product management circle which encircles each one of these, so you are the only discipline, which is the co-collaborator for all of these disciplines and tying all these things out.

(00:49:59):
So it's not about you standing alone, it's you always collaborating and pairing with someone else. But you are the only one who's pairing with everyone else and therefore, you have that unique insight which no one else in the team will have. That role can be played by someone else, it doesn't necessarily need to be called a product manager. But if you are being called a product manager, you figure out the [inaudible 00:50:24] the time piece that you are. And when you are added to the team, you must dream the team's overall contribution, overall energy and overall output up and not down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that. Something I always tell people is the PM doesn't necessarily have the magical skills other team members don't have, it's that they don't also have another job. Engineers may do a great job at being the PM, they just also have to build and code. And they don't have time to do all the things that a PM has to do, and a designer is in the same way, a researcher or data person. And so oftentimes, that's just like there's this person that has the time to do all these glue, work things between teams. And the great PMs also are very good at these skills that help you do these things, but it doesn't mean other people can't do them.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:51:19):
You see yourself as playing a role and not your title and not your function, and that just clarifies a lot of things for people. And different people will play different roles. And depending on the kind of a PM you are, are you in a specific domain or you are slightly generalist, the role that you will be playing in different teams can be different and the variety of roles that you can play makes you a better product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
I love that. You've mentioned these four access attributes of great product managers, overall product managers. Let's just spend a little time here. So you say basically the things you need to be doing and good at, data, design/research technology, strategy, and then you also mentioned collaboration and communication. Maybe you're-

Vikrama Dhiman (00:52:08):
Yeah, organizational skills and community. I think those are very, very important because one of the things and one of the things which one of the product managers works with me continues to say, and I really plus on that a lot, is that product manager is the all community enabler in the team, in the organization. And that community is the software aspect which ties everyone together towards a common mission of delivering an output. And that I think is a very, very important goal in today's context, especially for teams which are becoming more remote or teams where people are not co-located or they're distributed. That community aspect becomes a very, very important part that product managers need to focus on and bring and channelize as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):
So let's just quickly describe each of these attributes. I imagine people might be thinking, "Okay, what should I get better at as a PM?" And this is an awesome list. Each company has their own career ladders and attributes and things like that, but not a lot of companies don't. So I think for people that are trying to figure out where do I need to get better, I think this is a really cool list. Can you just maybe just a sentence explanation of each of these attributes and skillsets that a PM needs?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:31):
So each one of those skills, like the most growth ladders, what they will do, is they will have say for data, they will have level one, exhibits these traits. Level two, exhibits this trait. Level three, exhibits this trait. Level four and level five and so on. That's how they'll describe it. But five is absolute ninja level data quality, like you could probably do a data startup of your own.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:55):
Like Crystal basically?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:53:57):
Crystal. And level zero is someone who cannot even basically define the basic metrics for this particular product and won't be able to figure out is this particular thing impacting orders or users or revenue. And so you'll really not be able to figure even that piece out. Similarly, on design and research, for product managers, we focus a lot more on problems and are you able to identify problems from a user's perspective. That's at level zero. And level five will be somebody who's able to define the user problems but is also able to tie them to business roles as well. So that makes it the holistic. Similarly, on technology, it's one of the skills which is relatively easier to define where you don't have any tech understanding. If somebody asked you what is HTTP or API or internet and you'll be like, "Okay, I don't know what it is."

(00:54:55):
And while on the other end, you are able to have deep debates and could probably write technology design documents yourself as well. I think sometimes people get confused between data science. And in different organizations, I see data science bucketed either in data or in technology. Either is fine as long as you are clear on what your organization's framework is. Similarly then, there is strategy. Strategy is I think another area in product management which gets very confusing because there is obviously corporate strategy, there is business strategy, there's pricing strategy, there's strategy everywhere. Product strategy for me is where you are able to define that while somebody defines that this is the mountain that you're going to climb, but okay, how are you going to climb that mountain is basically the product strategy piece.

(00:55:47):
So you are not in charge of okay, are you focused on growth? Are you focused on revenue? Are you focused on profitability? That's someone's choice. Are you going to pick this country? Are you going to pick that country? But once that is picked, what are the user segments that you're going to focus on? What are the needs of those user segments? How are we going to figure out what the right product for them will be? What is the order in which we are going to work on that? That whole piece of product strategy is with the product managers. And again, in the first case, you are basically going to rely on everyone to tell you, do this, do this, do this. In second and in the level five cases, you are able to articulate a very coherent product strategy at a broad level as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:33):
Amazing, thanks for sharing that. I think for people that are trying to craft career ladder for product managers, this could help inform the way they think about this. By the way, when we mentioned Crystal, for folks that have no idea who we're talking about, she was a early head of growth at Gojek back in the day. She was a previous guest on the podcast. I always forget how to pronounce her last name exactly, but I think it's Widjaja, Crystal Widjaja.

Vikrama Dhiman (00:56:33):
Widjaja.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):
Widjaja? Okay, okay. Great. Going in a different direction, we're going to move to contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you believe that other people wouldn't agree with or generally just don't believe?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:57:12):
I used to think intent is the most important thing, right? And when I was starting off, that used to be the advice that as long as your intent is right, even if some of your words are not landing, even if some of the comms are not landing, that will work out. What I've seen is that it's not enough. Your actions, your behavior, and the way you communicate, the way you collaborate, that also has to communicate and show who you are as well. So intent is not enough. And that's a thing which I think a lot of people in my age group just don't get, but people who are slightly starting off their career, it resonates well with them. Second thing I think where I feel that it's become, I don't know, is it contrarian or it's become politically incorrect, is that you still need to put in the effort and our number of hours is effort.

(00:58:23):
And I think that's one thing which has become very politically incorrect to say over the years when I was younger, it was the norm that yes, you will have to put in the effort, you will have to put in the hours to grow and improve your skills. And it's not even about your growth in the company, it's just your own growth. You have to spend the time, effort, and energy into growing. I think a lot of that is getting lost in the debates between complete workaholism and just being not very serious about your growth at all. So I think those are the two that I find myself having to explain myself again and again and why I feel this way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):
I completely agree with that. I find a hugely strong correlation between hours you put into the work you do and success. And I think there's been a return to okay, working hard is really important and you shouldn't be afraid of promoting working really hard. So we've actually gone through everything that I wanted to ask you. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share or is there anything you want to leave listeners with?

Vikrama Dhiman (00:59:41):
No, I think it has been great talking to. I hope it was useful to people. I've tried to keep it real, but also in takeaway format. And if there are any questions that you have that I feel I have not answered, I'm happy to answer them.
