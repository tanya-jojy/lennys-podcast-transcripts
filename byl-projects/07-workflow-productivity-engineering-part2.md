## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
To build great AI products, you need to be really good at building evals. It's the highest ROI activity you can engage in.

Hamel Husain (00:00:05):
This process is a lot of fun. Everyone that does this immediately gets addicted to it. When you're building an AI application, you just learn a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
What's cool about this is you don't need to do this many, many times. For most products, you do this process once and then you build on it.

Shreya Shankar (00:00:18):
The goal is not to do evals perfectly, it's to actionably improve your product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):
I did not realize how much controversy and drama there is around evals. There's a lot of people with very strong opinions.

Shreya Shankar (00:00:28):
People have been burned by evals in the past. People have done evals badly, so then they didn't trust it anymore, and then they're like, "Oh, I'm anti evals."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
What are a couple of the most common misconceptions people have with evals?

Hamel Husain (00:00:39):
The top one is, "We live in the age of AI. Can't the AI just eval it?" But it doesn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
A term that you used in your posts that I love is this idea of a benevolent dictator.

Hamel Husain (00:00:49):
When you're doing this open coding, a lot of teams get bogged down in having a committee do this. For a lot of situations, that's wholly unnecessary. You don't want to make this process so expensive that you can't do it. You can appoint one person whose taste that you trust. It should be the person with domain expertise. Oftentimes, it is the product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guests are Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar. One of the most trending topics on this podcast over the past year has been the rise of evals. Both the chief product officers of Anthropic and OpenAI shared that evals are becoming the most important new skill for product builders. And since then, this has been a recurring theme across many of the top AI builders I've had on. Two years ago, I had never heard the term evals. Now it's coming up constantly. When was the last time that a new skill emerged that product builders had to get good at to be successful?

(00:01:41):
Hamel and Shreya have played a major role in shifting evals from being an obscure, mysterious subject to one of the most necessary skills for AI product builders. They teach the definitive online course on evals, which happens to be the number one course on Maven. They've now taught over 2,000 PMs and engineers across 500 companies, including large swaths of the OpenAI and Anthropic teams along with every other major AI lab.

(00:02:07):
In this conversation, we do a lot of show versus tell. We walk through the process of developing an effective eval, explain what the heck evals are and what they look like, address many of the major misconceptions with evals, give you the first few steps you can take to start building evals for your product, and also share just a ton of best practices that Hamel and Shreya have developed over the past few years. This episode is the deepest yet most understandable primer you'll find on the world of evals. And honestly, it got me excited to write evals, even though I have nothing to write evals for. I think you'll feel the same way as you watch this.

(00:02:41):
If this conversation gets you excited, definitely check out Hamel and Shreya's course on Maven. We'll link to it in the show notes. If you use the code LENNYSLIST when you purchase the course, you'll get 35% off the price of the course. With that, I bring you Hamel Husain and Shreya Shankar.

(00:02:58):

Hamel and Shreya, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Hamel Husain (00:05:04):
Thank you for having us.

Shreya Shankar (00:05:05):
Yeah, super excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:07):
I'm even more excited. Okay, so a couple years ago, I had never heard the term evals. Now it's one of the most trending topics on my podcast, essentially, that to build great AI products, you need to be really good at building evals. Also, it turns out some of the fastest-growing companies in the world are basically building and selling and creating evals for AI labs. I just had the CEO of Mercor on the podcast. So there's something really big happening here. I want to use this conversation to basically help people understand this space deeply, but let's start with the basics. Just what the heck are evals? For folks that have no idea what we're talking about, give us just a quick understanding of what an eval is, and let's start with Hamel.

Hamel Husain (00:05:49):
Sure. Evals is a way to systematically measure and improve an AI application, and it really doesn't have to be scary or unapproachable at all. It really is, at its core, data analytics on your LLM application and a systematic way of looking at that data, and where necessary, creating metrics around things so you can measure what's happening, and then so you can iterate and do experiments and improve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:22):
So that's a really good broad way of thinking about it. If you go one level deeper just to give people a very, even more concrete way of imagining and visualizing what we're talking about, even if you have a example to show would be even better, what's an even deeper way of understanding what an eval is?

Hamel Husain (00:06:36):
Let's say you have a real estate assistant application and it's not working the way you want. It's not writing emails to customers the way you want, or it's not calling the right tools, or any number of errors. And before evals, you would be left with guessing. You would maybe fix a prompt and hope that you're not breaking anything else with that prompt, and you might rely on vibe checks, which is totally fine.

(00:07:11):
And vibe checks are good and you should do vibe checks initially, but it can become very unmanageable very fast because as your application grows, it's really hard to rely on vibe checks. You just feel lost. And so evals help you create metrics that you can use to measure how your application is doing and kind of give you a way to improve your application with confidence. That you have a feedback signal in which to iterate against.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:44):
So just to make very real, so imagining this real estate agent, maybe they're helping you book a listing or go see an open house. The idea here is you have this agent talking to people, it's answering questions, pointing them to things. As a builder of that agent, how do you know if it's giving them good advice, good answers? Is it telling them things that are completely wrong?

(00:08:04):
So the idea of evals, essentially, is to build a set of tests that tell you, how often is this agent doing something wrong that you don't want it to do? And there's a bunch of ways you could define wrong. It could be just making up stuff. It could be just answering in a really strange way. The way I think about evals, and tell me if this is wrong, just simply is like unit tests for code. You're smiling. You're like, "No, you idiot."

Shreya Shankar (00:08:29):
No, that's not what I was thinking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):
Okay. Okay, okay, tell me. Tell me, how does that feel as a metaphor?

Shreya Shankar (00:08:35):
Okay. I like what you said first, which is we had a very broad definition. Evals is a big spectrum of ways to measure application quality. Now, unit tests are one way of doing this. Maybe there are some non-negotiable functionalities that you want your AI assistant to have, and unit tests are going to be able to check that. Now, maybe you also, because these AI assistants are doing such open-ended tasks, you kind of also want to measure how good are they at very vague or ambiguous things like responding to new types of user requests or figuring out if there's new distributions of data like new users are coming and using your real estate agent that you didn't even know would use your product. And then all of a sudden, you think, "Oh, there's a different way you want to kind of accommodate this new group of people."

(00:09:24):
So evals could also be a way of looking at your data regularly to find these new cohorts of people. Evals could also be like metrics that you just want to track over time, like you want to track people saying, "Yes. Thumbs up. I liked your message." You want very, very basic things that are not necessarily AI-related but can go back into this flywheel of improving your product. So I would say, overall, unit tests are a very small part of that very big puzzle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):
Awesome. You guys actually brought an example of an eval just to show us exactly what the hell we're talking about. We're talking in these big ideas. So how about let's pull one up and show people, "Here's what an eval is."

Hamel Husain (00:10:06):
Yeah, let me just set the stage for it a little bit. So to echo what Shreya said, it's really important that we don't think of evals as just tests. There's a common trap that a lot of people fall into because they jump straight to the test like, "Let me write some tests," and usually that's not what you want to do. You should start with some kind of data analysis to ground what you should even test, and that's a little bit different than software engineering where you have a lot more expectations of how the system is going to work. With LLMs, it's a lot more surface area. It's very stochastic, so you kind of have a different flavor here.

(00:10:47):
And so the example I'm going to show you today, it's actually a real estate example. It's a different kind of real estate example. It's from a company called Nurture Boss. I can share my screen to show you their website just to help you understand this use case a little bit, so let me share my screen. So this is a company that I worked with. It's called Nurture Boss, and it is a AI assistant for property managers who are managing apartments, and it helps with various tasks such as inbound leads, customer service, booking appointments, so on and so forth. It's like all the different sort of operations you might be doing as a property manager, it helps you with that. And so you can see kind of what they do. It's a very good example because it has a lot of the complexities of a modern AI application.

(00:11:40):
So there's lots of different channels that you can interact through the AI with like chat, text, voice, but also, there's tool calls, lots of tool calls for booking appointments, getting information about availability, so on and so forth. There's also RAG retrieval, getting information about customers and properties and things like that. So it's pretty fully fleshed in terms of an AI application. And so they have been really generous with me in allowing me to use their data as a teaching example. And so we have anonymized it, but what I'm going to walk through today is, okay, let's do the first part of how we would start to build evals for Nurture Boss. Why would we even want to do that?

(00:12:36):
So let's go through the very beginning stage, what we call error analysis, which is, let's look at the data of their application and first start with what's going wrong. So I'm going to jump to that next, and I'm going to open an observability tool. And you can use whatever you want here. I just happen to have this data loaded in a tool called Braintrust, but you can load it in anything. We don't have a favorite tool or anything in the blog post that we wrote with you. We had the same example but in Phoenix Arize, and I think Aman, on your blog post, used Phoenix Arize as well. And there's also LangSmith. So these are kind of like different tools that you can use.

(00:13:29):
So what you see here on the screen, this is logs from the application, and let me just show you how it looks. So what you see here is, and let me make it full screen, this is one particular interaction that a customer had with the Nurture Boss application, and what it is is a detailed log of everything that happened. So it's called a trace, and it's just the engineering term for logs of a sequence of events. The concept of a trace has been around for a really long time, but it's especially really important when it comes to AI applications.

(00:14:12):
And so we have all the different components and pieces and information that the AI needs to do its job, and we are logged all of it and we're looking at a view of that. And so you see here a system prompt. The system prompt says, "You are an AI assistant working as a leasing team member at Retreat at Acme Apartments." Remember, I said this is anonymized, so that's why the name is Acme Apartments. "Your primary role is to respond to text messages from both current residents and prospective residents. Your goal is to provide accurate, helpful information," yada, yada, yada. And then there's a lot of detail around guidelines of how we want this thing to behave.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:56):
Is this their actual system prompt, by the way, for this company?

Hamel Husain (00:14:58):
It is. Yes, it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:58):
Amazing. That's so cool.

Hamel Husain (00:14:59):
It's a real system prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):
That's amazing because it's rare you see a actual company product's system prompt. That's like their crown jewels a lot of times, so this is actually very cool on its own.

Hamel Husain (00:15:08):
Yeah. Yeah, it's really cool. And you see all of these different sort of features that are different use cases, so things about tour scheduling, handling applications, guidance on how to talk to different personas, so on and so forth. And you can see the user just kind of jumps in here and asks, "Okay, do you have a one-bedroom with study available? I saw it on virtual tours." And then you can see that the LLM calls some tools. It calls this get individual's information tool, and it pulls back that person's information. And then it gets the community's availability. So it's querying a database with the availability for that apartment complex.

(00:16:01):
And then finally, the AI responds, "Hey, we have several one-bedroom apartments available, but none specifically listed with a study. Here are a few options."

(00:16:12):
And then it says, "Can you let me know when one with a study is available?"

(00:16:16):
And then it says, "I currently don't have specific information on the availability of a one-bedroom apartment."

(00:16:23):
User says, "Thank you."

(00:16:25):
And the AI says, "You're welcome. If you have any more questions, feel free to reach out." Now, this is an example of a trace, and we're looking at one specific data point. And so one thing that's really important to do when you're doing data analysis of your LLM application is to look at data. Now, you might wonder, "There's a lot of these logs. It's kind of messy. There's a lot of things going on here. How in the hell are you supposed to look at this data? Do you want to just drown in this data? How do you even analyze this data?"

(00:17:07):
So it turns out there is a way to do it that is completely manageable, and it's not something that we invented. It's been around in machine learning and data science for a really long time, and it's called error analysis. And what you do is, the first step in conquering data like this is just to write notes. Okay? So you got to put your product hat on, which is why we're talking to you, because product people have to be in the room and they have to be involved in sort of doing this. Usually a developer is not suited to do this, especially if it's not a coding application.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:47):
And just to mirror back, why I think you're saying that is because this is the user experience of your product. People talking to this agent is the entire product essentially, and so it makes sense for the product person to be super involved in this.

Hamel Husain (00:17:59):
Yeah. So let's reflect on this conversation. Okay, a user asked about availability. The AI said, "Oh, we don't really have that. Have a nice day." Now, for a product that is helping you with lead management, is that good? Do you feel like this is the way we want it to go?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):
Not ideal.

Hamel Husain (00:18:32):
Yes, not ideal, and I'm glad you said that. A lot of people would say, "Oh, it's great. The AI did the right thing. It looked, it said, 'We didn't have available,' and it's not available." But with your product hat on, you know that's not correct. And so what you would do is you would just write a quick note here. You would say, "Okay." You might pop in here, and you can write a note. So every observability application has ability to write notes, and you wouldn't try to figure out if something is wrong. In this case, it's kind of not doing the right thing, but you just write a quick note, "Should have handed off to a human."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:19):
And as we watch this happening, it's like you mention this and you'll explain more. You're doing this, this feels very manual and unscalable, but as you said, this is just one step of the process and there's a system to this. That was just the first one.

Hamel Husain (00:19:30):
Yeah, and you don't have to do it for all of your data. You sample your data and just take a look, and it's surprising how much you learn when you do this. Everyone that does this immediately gets addicted to it and they say, "This is the greatest thing that you can do when you're building an AI application." You just learn a lot and you're like, "Hmm, this is not how I want it to work. Okay." And so that's just an example.

(00:19:58):
So you write this note, and then we can go on to the next trace. So this is the next trace. I just pushed a hot key on my keyboard. Let me go back to looking at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:09):
And these tools make it easy to go through a bunch and add these notes quickly.

Hamel Husain (00:20:13):
Yes. And so this is another one. Similar system prompt. We don't need to go through all of it again. We'll just jump right into the user question. "Okay, I've been texting you all day." Isn't that funny? And the user says, "Please." Okay, yeah, this one is just like an error in the application where this is a text message application, sorry, the channel through which the customer is communicating is through text message, and you're just getting really garbled. And you can see here that it kind of doesn't make sense. The words are being cut off like, "In the meantime," and then the system doesn't know how to respond, because you know how people text message, they write short phrases. They split their sentence across four or five different turns. So in this case-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:16):
Yeah, so what do you do with something like that?

Hamel Husain (00:21:18):
Yeah, so this is a different kind of error.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:19):
Mm.

Hamel Husain (00:21:19):
This is more of, "Hey, we're not handling this interaction correctly. This is more of a technical problem," rather than, "Hey, the AI is not doing exactly what we want." So we would write that down too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):
Which is still really cool.

Hamel Husain (00:21:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
It's amazing you're catching that, too, here. Otherwise, you'd have no idea this was happening.

Hamel Husain (00:21:35):
Yeah, you might not know this is happening, right? And so you would just say, "Okay." You would write a note like, "Oh, conversation flow is janky because of text message."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):
And I like that, I like that you're using the word janky. It shows you just how informal this can be at this stage.

Hamel Husain (00:21:56):
Yeah, it's supposed to be chill. Just don't overthink it. And there's a way to do this. So the question always comes up, how do you do this? Do you try to find all the different problems in this trace? What do you write a note about? And the answer is, just write down the first thing that you see that's wrong, the most upstream error. Don't worry about all the errors, just capture the first thing that you see that's wrong, and stop, and move on. And you can get really good at this. The first two or three can be very painful, but you can do a bunch of them really fast.

(00:22:38):
So here's another one, and let's skip the system prompt again. And the user asks, "Hey, I'm looking for a two- to three-bedroom with either one or two baths. Do you provide virtual tours?"

(00:22:51):
And a bunch of tools are called and it says, "Hi Sarah. Currently, we have three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom apartment available for $2,175. Unfortunately, we don't have any two-bedroom options at the moment. We do offer virtual tours. You can schedule a tour," blah, blah. It just so happens that there is no virtual tour, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):
Mm-hmm. Nice.

Hamel Husain (00:23:16):
So it is hallucinating something that doesn't exist. Then you kind of have to bring your context as an engineer, or even product content, and say, "Hey, this is kind of weird. We shouldn't be telling a person about virtual tour when it's not offered."

(00:23:32):
So you would say, "Okay, offered virtual tour," and you just write the note. So you can see there's a diversity of different kinds of errors that we're seeing, and we're actually learning a lot about your application in a very short amount of time.

Shreya Shankar (00:23:55):
One common question that we get from people at this stage is, "Okay, I understand what's going on. Can I ask an LLM to do this process for me?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:04):
Mm, great question.

Shreya Shankar (00:24:04):
And I loved Hamel's most recent example because what we usually find when we try to ask an LLM to do this error analysis is it just says the trace looks good because it doesn't have the context needed to understand whether something might be bad product smell or not. For example, the hallucination about scheduling the tour, right? I can guarantee you, I would bet money on this, if I put that into chat GPT and asked, "Is there an error?" it would say, "No, did a great job."

(00:24:34):
But Hamel had the context of knowing, "Oh, we don't actually have this virtual tour functionality," right? So I think, in these cases, it's so important to make sure you are manually doing this yourself. And we can talk a little bit more about when to use LLMs in the process later, but number one pitfall right here is people are like, "Let me automate this with an LLM."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:55):
Do you think we'll get to a place where an agent can do this, where it has that context?

Shreya Shankar (00:24:58):
Oh, no. No, no, no. Sorry. There are parts of error analysis that an LLM is suited for, which we could talk about later in this podcast. But right now, in this stage of free form, note-taking is not the place for an LLM.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
Got it. And this is something you call open coding, this step?

Shreya Shankar (00:25:14):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):
Cool. Another term that you used in your posts that I love and that fits into this step is this idea of a benevolent dictator. Maybe just talk about what that is, and maybe, Shreya, cover that.

Shreya Shankar (00:25:27):
Yeah, so Hamel actually came up with this term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
Okay, maybe Hamel cover that, actually.

Hamel Husain (00:25:33):
No problem. And we'll actually show the LLM automation in this example, because we're going to take this example, we're going to go all the way through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:40):
Amazing.

Hamel Husain (00:25:41):
And so benevolent dictator is just a catchy term for the fact that when you're doing this open coding, a lot of teams get bogged down in having a committee do this. And for a lot of situations, that's wholly unnecessary. People get really uncomfortable with, "Okay, we want everybody on board. We want everybody involved," so on and so forth. You need to cut through the noise. And a lot of organizations, if you look really deeply, especially small, medium-sized companies, you can appoint one person whose tastes that you trust. And you can do this with a small number of people and often one person, and it's really important to make this tractable. You don't want to make this process so expensive that you can't do it. You're going to lose out.

(00:26:36):
So that's the idea behind benevolent dictator, is, "Hey, you need to simplify this across as many dimensions as you can." Another thing that we'll talk about later is when it goes to building an LLM as a judge, you need a binary score. You don't want to think about, "Is this like a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?" Like, assign a score to it. You can't. That's going to slow it down.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Just to make sure this benevolent dictator point is really clear, basically, this is the person that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):
Make sure this benevolent dictator point is really clear. Basically, this is the person that does this note-taking, and ideally they're the expert on the stuff. So if it's law stuff, maybe there's a legal person that owns this, it could be a product manager. Give us advice on who this person should be?

Hamel Husain (00:27:16):
Yeah. It should be the person with domain expertise. So in this case, it would be the person who understands the business of leasing, apartment leasing, and has context to understand if this makes sense. It's always a domain expert, like you said. Okay. For legal, it would be a law person. For mental health, it would be the mental health expert, whether that's a psychiatrist or someone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:41):
Cool.

Hamel Husain (00:27:42):
Though oftentimes, it is the product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:44):
Cool. So the advice here is pick that person. It may not feel so super fair that they're the one in charge and they're the dictator, but they're benevolent. It's going to be okay.

Hamel Husain (00:27:52):
Yeah. It's going to be okay. It's not perfection. You're just trying to make progress and get signal quickly so you have an idea of what to work on because it can become infinitely expensive if you're not careful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:07):
Yeah. Okay, cool. Let's go back to your examples.

Hamel Husain (00:28:09):
Yeah, no problem. So this is another example where we have someone saying, "Okay. Do you have any specials?" And the assistant or the AI responds, "Hey, we have a 5% military discount." User responds, and it switches the subject, "Can you tell me how many floors there are? Do you have any one-bedrooms available or one-bedrooms on the first floor?" And the AI responds, "Yeah, okay. We have several one-bedroom apartments available." And then the user wants to confirm, "Any of those on the first floor and how much are the one-bedrooms?" And then also, it's a current resident, so they're also asking, "I need a maintenance request."

(00:28:56):
You could see the messiness of the real world in here, and the assistant just calls a tool that says transfer call, but it doesn't say anything. It just abruptly does transfer call, so it's pretty jank, I would say. It's just not-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:13):
Another jank.

Hamel Husain (00:29:14):
Another kind of jank, a different kind of jank. So when you write the open note, you don't want to say jank, because what we want to do is we want to understand, and when we look at the notes later on, we want to understand what happened.

(00:29:24):
So you just want to say, "Did not confirm call transfer with user." And it doesn't have to be perfect. You just have to have a general idea of what's going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:39):
Cool.

Hamel Husain (00:29:39):
So, okay. So let's say we do, and Shreya and I, we recommend doing at least 100 of these. The question is always, "How many of this do you do?" And so there's not a magic number. We say 100 just because we know that as soon as you start doing this, once you do 20 of these, you will automatically find it so useful that you will continue doing it.

(00:30:07):
So we just say 100 to mentally unblock you, so it's not intimidating. It's like, "Don't worry, you're only going to do 100." And there is a term for that, so the right answer is, "Keep looking at traces until you feel like you're not learning anything new." Maybe Shreya should talk about-

Shreya Shankar (00:30:30):
Yeah. So there's actually a term-

Hamel Husain (00:30:31):
... that.

Shreya Shankar (00:30:31):
... in data analysis and qualitative analysis called theoretical saturation. So what this means is when you do all of these processes of looking at your data, when do you stop? It's when you are theoretically saturating or you're not uncovering any new types of notes, new types of concepts, or nothing that will materially change the next part of your process.

(00:30:57):
And this kind of takes a little bit of intuition to develop, so typically, people don't really know when they've reached theoretical saturation yet. That's totally fine. When you do two or three examples or rounds of this, you will develop the intuition. A lot of people realize, "Oh, okay. I only need to do 40, I only need to do 60. Actually, I only need to do 15." I don't know. Depends on the application and depends on how savvy you are with error analysis for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:25):
And your point about you're going to want to do a bunch. I imagine it's because you're just like, "Oh, I'm discovering all these problems. I got to see what else is going on here."

Shreya Shankar (00:31:33):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:34):
Is that right?

Shreya Shankar (00:31:34):
And promise, at some point, you're not going to discover new types of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:39):
Yeah. Awesome. So let's say you did 100 of these, what's the next step?

Hamel Husain (00:31:42):
Yeah. Okay. So you did 100 of these. Now you have all these notes. So this is where you can start using AI to help you. So the part where you looked at this data is important, like we discussed. You don't want to automate this part too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:59):
Humans will still have jobs. This is the takeaway here. That's great.

Hamel Husain (00:32:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Just reviewing traces. At least there's one job left for now. Great.

Hamel Husain (00:32:06):
So, yeah. Exactly. And so, okay. You have all these notes. Now, to turn this into something useful, you can do basic counting. So basic counting is the most powerful analytical technique in data science because it's so simple and it's kind of undervalued in many cases, and so it's very approachable for people.

(00:32:33):
And so the first thing you want to do is take these notes, and you can categorize them with an LLM, and so there's a lot of different ways to do that. Right before this podcast, I took three different coding agents or AI tools in how to categorize these notes. So one is, "Okay, I uploaded into a cloud project, I uploaded a CSV of these notes, and I just exported them directly from this interface." There's a lot of different ways to do this, but I'm showing you the simple, stupid way, the most basic way of doing things.

(00:33:13):
And so I dumped the CSV in here and I said, "Please analyze the following CSV file." And I told it there's a metadata field that has a note in it, but what I said is I used the word open codes, and I said, "Hey, I have different open codes," and that's a term of art. LLMs know what open codes are and they know what axial codes are because it is a concept that's been around for a really long time, so those words help me shortcut what I'm trying to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
That's awesome. And the end of the prompt is telling it to create axial codes?

Hamel Husain (00:33:50):
Yes. Creating axial codes, so what it does is-

Shreya Shankar (00:33:54):
So maybe it's worth talking about what are axial codes or what's the point here? You have a mess of open codes, and you don't have 100 distinct problems. Actually, many of them are repeats, but because you phrased them differently, and that you shouldn't have tried to create your taxonomy of failures as you're open coding. You just want to get down what's wrong and then organize, "Okay, what's the most common failure mode?"

(00:34:19):
So the purpose, axial code basically is just a failure mode. It's the label or category. And what our goal is, is to get to this clusters of failure modes and figure out what is the most prevalent, so then you can go and run and attack that problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:36):
That is really helpful. Basically, just synthesizing all these-

Shreya Shankar (00:34:36):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):
... into categories and themes. Super cool. And we'll include this prompt in our show notes for folks so they don't have to sit there and screenshot it and try to type it up themselves.

Hamel Husain (00:34:49):
Yeah. Great idea. And so Claude went ahead and analyzed the CSV file and decided how to parse it, blah, blah, blah. We don't need to worry about all that stuff, but it came up with a bunch of axial codes. Basically, axial codes are categories, like Shreya said. So one is, okay, capability limitations, misrepresentation, process and protocol violations, human handoff issues, communication, quality. It created these categories.

(00:35:18):
Now, do I like all the categories? Not really. I like some of them. It's a good first stab at it. I would probably rename it a little bit because some of them are a bit too generic. Like what is capability limitation? That's a little bit too broad. It's not actionable. I want to get a little bit more actionable with it so that if I do decide it's a problem, I know what to do with it, but we'll discuss that in a little bit. So you can do this with anything, and this is the dumbest way to do it, but dumb sometimes is a good way to get started, so-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):
And this is what LLMS are really good at, taking a bunch of information and synthesizing it.

Shreya Shankar (00:35:53):
Absolutely. Synthesizing for us to make sense of, right? Note that it's not automatically proposing fixes or anything, that's our job, but now, we can wade through this mess of open codes a lot easier.

(00:36:05):
Another thing that's interesting here in this prompt to generate the axial codes is you can be very detailed if you want, right? You can say, "I want each axial code to actually be some actionable failure mode," and maybe the LLM will understand that and propose it, or, "I want you to group these open codes by what stage of the user story that it's in." So this is where you can be creative or do what's best for you as a product manager or engineer working on this, and that will help you do the improvement later.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:40):
So there's no definitive prompt of, "Here's the one way to do it"?

Shreya Shankar (00:36:42):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):
You're saying you can iterate, see what works for you?

Shreya Shankar (00:36:46):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:46):
It's interesting the tools don't do this, or do they try and they just don't do a great job?

Shreya Shankar (00:36:50):
No, I don't think they do it. We've been screaming from the rooftops, "Please, please-"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:54):
Oh, wow.

Shreya Shankar (00:36:55):
"... do this." I do think it's a little bit hard, right? Part of this whole experience with the eval scores Hamel and I are teaching are a lot of people don't actually know this, so maybe it's that people don't know this and they don't know how to build tools for it. And hopefully, we can demystify some of this magic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:13):
And just to double-click on this point, this is not a thing everyone does or knows. This is something you two developed based on your experience doing data analysis and data science at other companies?

Shreya Shankar (00:37:23):
Well, I want to caveat that we didn't invent error analysis. We don't actually want to invent things. That's bad signal. If somebody is coming to you with a way to do something that's entirely new and not grounded in hundreds of years of theory and literature, then you should, I don't know, be a little bit wary of that.

(00:37:42):
But what we tried to do was distill, "Okay, what are the new tools and techniques that you need to make sense of the LLM error-out analysis?" And then we created a curriculum or structured way of doing this. So this is all very tailored to LLMs, but the terms open coding, axial coding, are grounded in social science.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:04):
Amazing. Okay. What's funny about you guys doing this is I just want to go do this somewhere. I don't have any AI product to do this on, but it's just like, "Oh, this would be so fun." Just sit there and find all the problems I'm running into and categorize them and then try to fix them.

Shreya Shankar (00:38:18):
I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):
Hamel pulled up a video. What do you got going on here?

Hamel Husain (00:38:22):
Yeah. So I pulled up a video just to drive home Shreya's point. We are not inventing anything, so what you see on the screen here is Andrew Ng, one of the famous machine learning researchers in the world who have taught a lot of people, frankly, machine learning. And you can see this is an eight-year-old video, and he's talking about error analysis.

(00:38:45):
And so this is a technique that's been used to analyze stochastic systems for ages, and it's something that it was just using the same machine learning ideas and principles, just bringing them into here, because again, these are stochastic systems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:01):
Awesome. Well, one thing, we're working on getting Andrew on the podcast, we're chatting, so that will-

Shreya Shankar (00:39:01):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):
... be really fun. Two, I love that my podcast episode just came out today is in your feed there, and it's standing out really well in that feed, so I'm really happy about that [inaudible 00:39:13].

Hamel Husain (00:39:13):
Very nice. Yeah. The recommendation algorithm is quite good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:15):
Yes. Here we go. Hope you click on that. Don't screw my algorithm. Okay, cool. So we've done some synthesis. I know we're not going to go through the entire step. This is you have a whole course that takes many days to learn this whole process. What else do you want to share about how to go about this process?

Hamel Husain (00:39:31):
Okay. So you can do this through anything, and the same thing works just fine in ChatGPT, the same exact prompt. You can see it made axial codes. I really like using Julius AI. It's one of my favorite tools.

(00:39:45):
Julius is kind of this third-party tool that uses notebooks. I personally like Jupiter notebooks a lot, and so it's more of a data science thing, but a lot of product managers that are kind of learning notebooks nowadays, and it's kind of cool. It's like a fun playground where you can write code and look at data. But we don't have to go deeply into that. Just wanted to mention, you can use a lot. AI is really good at this.

(00:40:10):
So let's go to the fun part. Here we go. So now we have these axial codes. So the first thing I like to do, I have these open codes, and I have the axial codes, let's say, that we assigned from the cloud project or the ChatGPT. And so what I do is I collect them first and I take a look, like, "Does these axial codes make sense?" And I look at the correspondence between the different axial codes and the open codes, and I go through an exercise and I say, "Hmm. Do I like these codes? Can I make them better? Can I refine them? Can I make them more specific?" Instead of being generic, I make them very specific and actionable.

(00:40:59):
So you see the ones that I came up with here are tour scheduling, rescheduling issues, human handoff or transfer issue, formatting error with an output, conversational flow. We saw the conversational flow issue with the text messages. Making follow-up promises not kept.

(00:41:18):
And so basically, what I can do, what you can do now is you have these axial codes, and so I just collect them into a list, so this is an Excel formula. Just collect these codes into a list, and now we have a comma-separated list of these codes. And then what you can simply do is you could take your notes that you have, those open codes, and you can tell an AI, and this is using Gemini and AI just for simplicity, this is, again, we're trying to keep it simple, categorize the following note into one of the following categories as always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):
For folks watching, I like all these different prompts and formulas you're sharing. This is the Google Sheets AI prompt.

Shreya Shankar (00:42:04):
Huge fan.

Hamel Husain (00:42:07):
And so basically, what you could do is you can categorize your traces into one of the buckets, and that's what we have here. We have categorized all those problems that we encountered into one of these things.

Shreya Shankar (00:42:22):
And this is automatic, which is very exciting. I mean, the AI is doing it. So this also drives home the point that your open codes have to be detailed, right? You can't just say janky because if the AI is reading janky, it's not going to be able to categorize it. Even a human wouldn't, right? It would have to go and remember why you said janky, so it's important to be somewhat detailed in your open code.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:45):
Okay. So avoid the word janky. It's a good rule of thumb.

Shreya Shankar (00:42:48):
Yeah. Or have it with 10 other words.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:48):
Oh, okay. What is-

Hamel Husain (00:42:48):
Yeah. I was being funny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:52):
Yeah, okay. What are some of those other words that people often use that you think are not good?

Shreya Shankar (00:42:57):
I don't think it's specific words. I think it's just people are not detailed enough in the open code, so it's hard to do the categorization.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
Great. And by the way, the reason you have to map them back is because, say, Claude or ChatGPT gave you suggestions and you change them and iterated on them, so you can't just go back and say, "Cool, whatever," in each bucket?

Hamel Husain (00:43:16):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):
Great.

Hamel Husain (00:43:17):
That's a really good question, actually. It's good to iterate and think about it a little bit like, "Do I like these open codes? Do these actually make sense to me?" Just like anything that AI does, it's really good to kind of put yourself in the middle just a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:32):
It's in the loop. Still space for us. Great.

Shreya Shankar (00:43:34):
One of the things that I like to do with this step if I'm trying to use AI to do this labeling, is also have a new category called none of the above. So an AI can actually say, "None of the above," in the axial code, and that informs me, "Okay, my axial codes are not complete. Let's go look at those open codes, let's figure out what some new categories are or figure out how to reword my other axial codes."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:00):
Awesome. And what's cool about this is you don't need to do this many, many times.

Shreya Shankar (00:44:03):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:04):
For most products, you do this process once, and then you build on it, I imagine, and you just tweak it over time?

Shreya Shankar (00:44:09):
Absolutely. And it gets so fast. People do this once a week, and you can do all of this in 30 minutes, and suddenly your product is so much better than if you were never aware of any of these problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
Yeah. It's absurd to feel like you wouldn't know this is happening. Watching this happening, I'm like, "How could you not do this to your product?"

Shreya Shankar (00:44:31):
A lot of people have no idea.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:31):
Most people. Yeah. We'll talk about that. There's a whole debate around this stuff that we want to talk about. Okay, cool. So you have the sheet. What comes next?

Hamel Husain (00:44:40):
Okay. So here's sort of the big unveil. This is the magic moment right now. So we have all these codes that we applied, the ones that we like on our traces. Now, you can do the ta-da, you can count them.

(00:44:56):
So here's a pivot table, and we just can do pivot table on those, and we can count how many times those different things occurred. So what do we find? Find on these traces that we categorized? We found 17 conversational flow issues. And I really like pivot tables because you can do cool things. You can double-click on these. You can say, "Oh, okay. Let me take a look at those," but that's going into an aside about pivot tables, how cool they are.

(00:45:25):
But now, we have just a nice, rough cut of what are our problems? And now, we have gone from chaos to some kind of thinking around, "Oh, you know what? These are my biggest problems. I need to fix conversational issues, maybe these human handoff issues." It's not necessarily the count is the most important thing. It might be something that's just really bad and you want to fix that, but okay. Now, you have some way of looking at your problem, and now you can think about whether you need evals for some of these.

(00:46:07):
So there might be some of these things that might be just dumb engineering errors that you don't need to write an eval for because it's very obvious on how to fix them. Maybe the formatting error with output, maybe you just forgot to tell the LLM how you want it to be formatted, and you didn't even say that in the prompt. So just go ahead and fix the prompt maybe, and we can decide, "Okay, do you want to write an eval for that?" You might still want to write an eval for that because you might be able to test that with just code. You could just test the string, does it have the right formatting potentially? Without running an LLM.

(00:46:53):
So there's a cost-benefit trade-off to evals. You don't want to get carried away with it, but you want to usually ground yourself in your actual errors. You don't want to skip this step. And so the reason I'm kind of spending so much time on this is this is where people get lost. They go straight into evals like, "Let me just write some tests," and that is where things go off the rails.

(00:47:24):
Okay. So let's say we want to tackle one of these things. So for example, let's say we want to tackle this human handoff issue, and we're like, "Hmm, I'm not really sure how to fix this. That's a kind of subjective sort of judgment call on should we be handing off to a human? And I don't know immediately how to fix it. It's not super obvious per se. Yeah. I can change my prompt, but I'm not sure. I'm not 100% sure."

(00:47:56):
Well, that might be sort of an interesting thing for an LLM as a judge, for example. So there's different kinds of evals. One is code-based, which you should try to do if you can because they're cheaper. LLM as a judge is something, it's like a meta eval. You have to eval that eval to make sure the LLM that's judging is doing the right thing, which we'll talk about in a second.

(00:48:25):
So, okay. LLM as a judge, that's one thing. Okay. How do you build an LLM as a judge?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:31):
Before we get into that actually, just to make sure people know exactly what you're describing there, these two types of evals. One is you said it's code-based and one is LLM as judge. Maybe Shreya, just help us understand what code-based eval even is? It's essentially a unit test? Is that a simple way to think about it?

Shreya Shankar (00:48:46):
Yeah. Maybe eval is not the right term here, but think automated evaluator. So when we find these failure modes, one of the things we want is, "Okay. Can we now go check the prevalence of that failure mode in an automated way without me manually labeling and doing all the coding and the grouping, and I want to run it on thousands and thousands of traces, I want to run it every week." That is, okay. You should probably build an automated evaluator to check for that failure mode.

(00:49:12):
Now, when we're saying code-based versus LLM-based, we're saying, "Okay. So maybe I could write a Python function or a piece of code to check whether that failure mode is present in a trace or not." And that's possible to do for certain things like checking the output is JSON, or checking that it's markdown, or checking that it's short. These are all things you can capture in code or you could approximately capture in code.

(00:49:38):
When we're talking about LLM judge here, we're saying that this is a complex failure mode and we don't know how to evaluate in an automated way. So maybe we will try to use an LLM to evaluate this very, very narrow, specific failure mode of handoffs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
So just to try to mirror back what you're describing, you want to test what your, say, agent or AI product is doing. You ask it a question, it gets back with something.

(00:50:05):
One way to test if it's giving you the right answer is if it's consistently doing the same thing, that you could write a code to tell you this is true or false. For example, will it ever say there's a virtual tour? So you could ask it.

Shreya Shankar (00:50:18):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:18):
"Do you provide virtual tours?" It says yes or no, and then you could write code to tell you if it's correct based on that specific answer.

(00:50:27):
But if you're asking about something more complicated and it's not binary, in one world, you need a human to tell you this is correct. The solution to avoid humans having to review all this every time automatically is LLMs replacing human judgment, and you'd call it an LLM as judge. The LLM as being the judge if this is correct or not.

Shreya Shankar (00:50:47):
Absolutely. You nailed it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:48):
Great.

Shreya Shankar (00:50:49):
So people always think, "Oh, this is at least as hard as my problem of creating the original agent." And it's not, because you're asking the judge to do one thing, evaluate one failure mode, so the scope of the problem is very small and the output of this LLM judge is pass or fail. So it is a very, very tightly scoped thing that LLM judges are very capable of doing very reliably.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:18):
And the goal here is just to have a suite of tests that run before you ship to production that tell you things are going the way you want them to? The way your agent is interacting is correct?

Shreya Shankar (00:51:28):
The beautiful thing about LLM judges, you can use them in unit tests or CI, sure, but you could also use it online for monitoring, right? I can sample 1000 traces every day, run my LLM judge, real production traces, and see what the failure rate is there. This is not a unit test, but still now we get an extremely specific measure of application quality.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:53):
Cool. That's a really great point because a lot of people just see evals for being this not-real-life thing. It's a thing that you test before it's actually in the real world. And what's actually happening in the real world, you're saying you should actually do exactly that?

Shreya Shankar (00:52:04):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:04):
Test your real thing running in production? And it's a daily, hourly sort of thing you could be running?

Shreya Shankar (00:52:09):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):
Awesome. Okay. Hamel's got an example of an actual LLM as a judge eval here, so let's take a look.

Hamel Husain (00:52:16):
I love how Shreya really teed it up for me, so thank you so much. So what we have is a LLM as a judge prompt for this one specific failure. Like Shreya said, you would want to do one specific failure and you want to make it binary because we want to simplify things. We don't want, "Hey, score this on a rating of one to five. How good is it?" That's just in most cases, that's a weasel way of not making a decision. Like, "No, you need to make a decision. Is this good enough or not? Yes or no?"

(00:52:50):
It can be painful to think about what that is, but you should absolutely do it. Otherwise, this thing becomes very untractable, and then when you report these metrics, no one knows what 3.2 versus 3.7 means, so.

Shreya Shankar (00:53:03):
Yeah. We see this all the time also, and even with expert-curated content on the internet where it's like, "Oh, here's your LLM judge evaluator prompt. Here's a one-to-seven scale."

(00:53:15):
And I always text Hamel like, "Oh, no. Now, we have to fight the misinformation again because we know somebody is going to try it out and then come back to us and say, 'Oh, I have 4.2 average,'" and we're going to be like, "Okay."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:31):
It's wild how much drama there is in the evals space. We're going to get to that. Oh, man.

(00:53:37):

Hamel Husain (00:54:45):
Okay, so this is your judge prompt. There's no one way to do it. It's okay to use an LLM to help you create it, but again, put yourself in the loop. Don't just blindly accept what the LLM does, and in all of these cases, that's what we did. With the axial codes, we iterated on this. You can use an LLM to help you create this prompt, but make sure you read it, make sure you edit it, whatever. This is not necessarily the perfect prompt. This is just the stupid, keeping it very simple just to show you the idea. It's like, "Okay, for this handoff failure," I said, "Okay, I want you to output true or false," it's a binary judge. That's what we recommend. Then I just go through and say, "Okay, when should you be doing a handoff?" And I just list them out.

(00:55:33):
Okay, explicit human requests ignored or looped, some policy-mandated transfer, sensitive resident issues, tool data, unavailability, same day walk-in or tour requests. You need to talk to a human for that, so on and so forth. The idea is, now that I know that this is a failure from my data, I'm interested in iterating on it, because I know this is actually happening all the time. Like Shreya said, it would be nice to have a way not only to evaluate this on the data I have, but also on production data, just to get a sense of, what scales is this happening? Let me find more traces, let me have a way to iterate on this. We can take this prompt and I'm going to use the spreadsheet again. The first step is, okay, when I'm doing this judge... I wrote the prompt.

(00:56:28):
Now, a lot of people stop there and they say, "Okay, I have my judge prompt. We're done. Good, let's just ship it," and the prompt says... If the judge says it's wrong, it's wrong. They just accept it as the gospel, be like, "Okay, the LLM says it's wrong, it must be wrong. Don't do that, because that's the fastest way that you can have evals that don't match what's going on, and when people lose trust in your evals, they lose trust in you. It's really important that you don't do that, so before you release your LLM as a judge, you want to make sure it's aligned to the human. How do you do that? You have those axial codes and you want to measure your judge against the axial code, and say like, "Hey, does it agree with me? My own judge, does it agree with me?" Just measure it.

(00:57:18):
What we have here is, okay, I say, "Assess this LLM trace." Again, I'm using just spreadsheets here, "Assess this LM trace according to these rules," and the rules are just the prompt that I just showed you. I ask it, "Okay, is there a handoff error, true or false?" Then this column, let me just zoom in a bit. Column H, I have, "Okay, did this error occur?" Column G is whether I thought the error occurred or not. You can see-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:53):
You're going through manually, you do that.

Hamel Husain (00:57:55):
Yeah, yeah, which we already did. We already went through it manually. It's not like we have to do it again, because we have that cheat code from the axial coding, we already did it. You might have to go through it again if you need more data, and there's a lot of details to this on how to do this correctly. You want to split your data and do all these things, so that you're not cheating, but I just want to show you the concept. Basically, what you can do is measure the agreement. Now, one thing you should know, as a product manager, is a lot of people go straight to this agreement. They say, "Okay, my judge agrees with the human some percentage of the time."

(00:58:41):
Now that sounds appealing, but it's a very dangerous metric to use, because a lot of times, errors, they only happen on the long tail and they don't happen as frequently, so if you only have the error 10% of the time, then you can easily have 90% agreement by just having a judge say it passes all the time. Does that make sense? 90% agreement look good on paper, but it might be misleading.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:15):
It's rare, it's a rare error. Yeah.

Hamel Husain (00:59:18):
As a product manager or someone, even if you're not doing this calculation yourself, if someone ever reports to you agreement, you should immediately ask, "Okay, tell me more." You need to look into it. They give you more intuition, here is like a matrix of this specific judge in the Google sheet, and this is, again, a pivot table, just keeping it dumb and simple. "Okay, on the rows I have, what did the human think? What did I think? Did it have an error, true or false? Then did my judge have an error, true or false?"

Shreya Shankar (00:59:56):
The intuition here is exactly what Hamel said, where you need to look at each type of error. When the human said false, but the judge said true, or vice versa, so those non-green diagonals here, and if they're too large, then go iterate on your prompt, make it more clear to the LLM judge, so that you can reduce that misalignment. You want to get to a point where most... You're going to have some misalignment, that's okay. We talk about in our course, also how to code correct that misalignment, but in this stage, if you're a product manager and the person who's building the LLM judge eval has not done this, they're saying like, "It agrees 75% of the time, we're good." They don't have this matrix and they haven't iterated to make sure that these two types of errors have gone down to zero, then it's a bad smell. Go and ask them to go fix that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:52):
Awesome. That's a really good tip, what to look for when someone's doing this wrong.

Shreya Shankar (01:00:56):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
Actually, can you take us back to the LLM as judge prompt? I just want to highlight something really interesting here. I've had some guests on the podcast recently who've been saying, "Evals are the new PRDs," and if you look at this, this is exactly what this is. Product managers, product teams, here's what the product should be, here's all the requirements, here's the how it should work. They built a thing and then they test it. Manually, often. What's cool about this is this is exactly that same thing, and it's running constantly. It's telling you, "Here's how this agent should respond," and it's very specific ways. "If it's this, this, this, do that. If it's this, this, that, do that." It's exactly what I've been hearing again and again, you could see right here. This is the purest sense of what a product requirements document should be, is this eval judge that's telling you exactly what it should be, and it's automatic and running constantly.

Shreya Shankar (01:01:45):
Yeah, absolutely. It's derived from our own data, so of course, it's a product manager's expectations. What I find that a lot of people miss is they just put in what their expectations are before looking at their data, but as we look at our data, we uncover more expectations that we couldn't have dreamed up in the first place, and that ends up going into this prompt.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:05):
That is interesting. Your advice is not skip straight to evals and LLM as judge prompts before you build the product, still write traditional one-pagers PRDs to tell your team what we're doing, why we're doing it, what success looks like. But then at the end, you could probably pull from that and even improve that original PRD if you're evolving the product using this process.

Shreya Shankar (01:02:28):
I would go even further to say you're going to improve... It's going to change. You're never going to know what the failure modes are going to be upfront, and you're always going to uncover new vibes that you think that your product should have. You don't really know what you want until you see it with these LLMs, so you got to be flexible, have to look at your data, have to... PRDs are a great abstraction for thinking about this. It's not the end all, be all. It's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
I love that, and Hamel's pulling up some cool research report. What's this about?

Hamel Husain (01:03:04):
This is one of the coolest research reports you can possibly read if you want to know about evals. It was authored by someone named Shreya Shankar.

Shreya Shankar (01:03:13):
Oh, my God.

Hamel Husain (01:03:15):
And her collaborators. It's called "Who Validates the Validated?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):
That's the best name for a researcher.

Shreya Shankar (01:03:21):
Thank you, thank you.

Hamel Husain (01:03:24):
I should let Shreya talk about this. I think one of the most important things to pay attention in this paper are the criteria drift, and what she found.

Shreya Shankar (01:03:35):
We did this super fun study when we were doing user studies with people who were trying to write LLM judges or just validate their own LLM outputs. I think this was before evals was extremely popular, I feel like, on the internet. We did this project late 2023 was when we started it. But then the thing that really was burning in my mind as a researcher is like, "Why is this problem so hard? We've been having machine learning and AI for so long, it's not new, but suddenly, this time around, everything is really difficult." We just did this user study with a bunch of developers and we realized, "Okay, what's new here is that you can't figure out your rubrics upfront. People's opinions of good and bad change as they review more outputs, they think of failure modes only after seeing 10 outputs they would never have dreamed of in the first place," and these are experts. These are people who have built many LLM pipelines and now agents before, and you can't ever dream up everything in the first place. I think that's so key in today's world of AI development.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
That is a really good point. That's very much reinforcing what we were just talking about and that's why I'll pull this up, is just... Okay-

Shreya Shankar (01:04:56):
The research behind it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:58):
Yeah, okay, great. You still got to do product the same way, but now you have this really powerful tool that helps you make sure what you've built is correct. It's not going to replace the PRD process. Cool. How many, say, I don't know, LLM as judge prompts, do you end up with usually say... I don't know. I know, obviously, depends complexity to the product, but what's a number in your experience?

Shreya Shankar (01:05:19):
For me, between four and seven.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
That's it.

Shreya Shankar (01:05:23):
It's not that many, because a lot of the failure modes, as Hamel said earlier, can be fixed by just fixing your prompt. You just didn't think to put it in your prompts, so now you put it in your... You shouldn't do an eval like this for everything, just the pesky ones that you've described your ideal behavior in your agent prompt, but it's still failing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
Got it. Say you found a problem, you fixed it. In traditional software development, you'd write a unit test to make sure it doesn't happen again. Is your insight here is, "Don't even bother writing an eval around that if it's just gone"?

Shreya Shankar (01:05:54):
I think you can if you want to, but the whole game here is about prioritizing. You have finite resources and finite time, you can't write an eval for everything, so prioritize the ones that are the more pesky areas.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:07):
Probably the ones that are most risky to your business if they say something like Mecha Hitler, Grok.

Shreya Shankar (01:06:07):
Yikes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:15):
Cool. Okay, so that's very relieving, because this prompt was a lot of work to really think through all these details.

Shreya Shankar (01:06:21):
But it's a lot of one-time cost. Right now, forever, you can run this on your application.

Hamel Husain (01:06:30):
Okay, data analysis is super powerful, is going to drive lots of improvements very quickly to your application. We showed the most basic kind of data analysis, which is counting, which is accessible to everyone. You can get more sophisticated with the data analysis. There's lots of different ways to sample, look at data. We made it look easy in a sense, but there's a lot of skills here to do to it well. Building an intuition and a nose for how to sort through this data. For example, let's say I find conversational issues, this conversational flow issues. Maybe if I was trying to chase down this problem further, I would think about ways to find other conversational flow issues that I didn't code. I would maybe dig through the data in several ways, and there's different ways to go about this. It's very similar, if not almost exactly similar as traditional analytics techniques that you would do on any product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
Give us just a quick sense of what comes next and then let's talk about the debate around evals and a couple more things.

Shreya Shankar (01:07:48):
What comes next after you've built your LLM judge? Well, we find that people just try to use that everywhere they can, so they'll put the LLM judge in unit tests and they will build, "Here are some example traces where we saw that failure, because we labeled it. Now we're going to make those part of unit tests and make sure that, every time we push a change to our code, these tests are going to pass." They also use it for online monitoring. People are making dashboards on this, and I think that's incredible. I think the products that are doing this, they have a very sharp sense of how well their application is performing, and people don't talk about it, because this is their moat. People are not going to go and share all of these things, because it makes sense. If you are an email-writing assistant, and you're doing this and you're doing it well, you don't want somebody else to go and build an email-writing assistant and then get you out of business.

(01:08:41):
I really want to stress the point that it's try to use these artifacts that you're building wherever possible online, repeatedly use them to drive improvements to your product. Oftentimes, Hamel and I will tell people how to do this up to this very point, and it clicks for people and then they never come back again. Either they have, I don't know, quit their jobs, they're not doing AI development anymore, or they know what to do from here on out. I think it's the latter, but I think it's very powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Just watching you do this really opened my eyes to what this is and how systematic the process is. I always imagine you just sit on a computer, "Okay, what are the things I need to make sure work correctly?" What you're showing us here is it's a very simple step-by-step based on real things that are happening in your product, how to catch them, identify them, prioritize them, and then catch them if they happen again and fix them.

Shreya Shankar (01:09:38):
Yeah, it's not magic. Anyone can do this, you're going to have to practice the skill, like any new skill, you have to practice, but you can do it. I think what's very empowering now is that product managers are doing this and can do this, and can really build very, very profitable products with this skill set.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:57):
Okay, great segue to a debate that we got pulled into that was happening on X the other day. I did not realize how much controversy and drama there is around evals. There's a lot of people with very strong opinions. How about Shreya? Give us just a sense of the two sides of the debate around the importance and value of evals, and then give us your perspective.

Shreya Shankar (01:10:19):
Yeah. All right, I'll be a little bit placating and I say I think everyone is on the same side. I think the misconception is that people have very rigid definitions of what evals is. For example, they might think that evals is just unit tests or they might think that evals is just the data analysis part and no online monitoring or no monitoring of product-specific metrics, like actually number of chats engaged in or whatnot. I think everyone has a different mindset of evals going in, and the other thing I will say is that people have been burned by evals in the past. I think people have done evals badly. One concrete example of this is they've tried to do an LLM judge, but it has not aligned with their expectations. They only uncovered this later on and then they didn't trust it anymore, and then they're like, "I'm anti evals."

(01:11:14):
I 100% empathize with that, because you should be anti Likert scale LLM judge. I absolutely agree with you, we are anti that as well. A lot of the misconception stems from two things, like people having a narrow definition of evals and then people not doing it well and then getting burned and then wanting to avoid other people making that mistake. Then, unfortunately, X or Twitter is a medium where people are misinterpreting what everybody is saying all the time, and you just get all these strong opinions of, "Don't do evals, it's bad. We tried it, it doesn't work. We're Claude Code," or whatever other famous product, "And we don't do evals." There's just so much nuance behind all of it, because a lot of these applications are standing on the shoulders of evals. Coding agents is a great example of that, Claude Code. They're standing on the shoulders of Claude base model... Not base, but the fine-tuned Claude models have been evaluated on many coding benchmarks. Can't argue against that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):
Just to make clear exactly what you're talking about there, one of the heads, I think maybe the head engineer of Claude Code, went on a podcast and he's like, "We don't do evals, we just vibe. We just look at vibes," and vibes meaning they just use it and feel if it's right or wrong.

Shreya Shankar (01:12:37):
I think that works. There's two things to that, right? One is they're standing on the shoulders of the evals that their colleagues are doing for coding.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:45):
Of the Claude foundational model.

Shreya Shankar (01:12:47):
Absolutely, right? We know that they report those numbers, because we see the benchmarks, we know who's doing well on those. The other thing is they are actually probably very systematic about the error analysis to some extent. I bet you that they're monitoring who is using Claude, how many people are using Claude, how many traps are being created, how long these chats are. They're also probably monitoring in their internal team, they're dogfooding. Anytime something is off, they maybe have a cue or they send it to the person developing Claude Code, and this person is implicitly doing some form of hair error analysis that Hamel talked about. All of this is evals, right? There's no world in which they're just being like, "I made Claude Code, I'm never looking at anything," and unfortunately, when you don't think about that or talk about that, I think that the community...

(01:13:39):
Most of the community is beginners or people who don't know about evals and want to learn about it, and it sends the wrong message there. Now, I don't know what Claude Code is doing, obviously, but I would be willing to bet money that they're doing something in the form of evals.

Hamel Husain (01:13:53):
We'll also say that coding agents are fundamentally very different than other AI products, because the developer is the domain expert, so you can short circuit a lot of things, and also, the developer is using it all day long, so there's a type of dogfooding and type of domain expertise that is... You can collapse the activities, you don't need as much data, you don't need as much feedback or exploration, because you know, so your eval process should look different.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:31):
Because you're seeing the code, you see the code it's generating. You can tell, "This is great, this is terrible."

Hamel Husain (01:14:35):
Yeah, yeah. I think a lot of people had generalized coding agents, because coding agents are the first AI product released into the wild, and I think it's a mistake to try to generalize that at large.

Shreya Shankar (01:14:51):
The other thing is, yeah, engineers have a dogfooding personality. There are plenty of applications where people are trying to build AI in certain domains and they don't have dogfooding for doctors, for example, or not out there trying to get all the most incorrect advice from AI and be tolerant and receptive to that. It's very important to keep, I think these nuanced things in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):
What I'm hearing from you, Shreya, interestingly, is that if humans on the team are doing very close data analysis, error analysis, dogfooding like crazy, and essentially, they're the human evals and you're describing that as that's within the umbrella of evals. You could do it that way if you have time and motivation to do that, or you could set these things up to be automatic.

Shreya Shankar (01:15:40):
Absolutely, it's also about the skills. People who work at Anthropic are very, very highly skilled. They've been trained in data analysis or software engineering or AI, and whatnot. You can get there, anyone can get there, of course, by learning the concepts, but most people don't have that skill right now.

Hamel Husain (01:16:02):
Dogfooding is a dangerous one, only because a lot of people will say they're dogfooding. They're like, "Yeah, we dogfooded," but are they, really? A lot of people aren't really dogfooding it at that visceral level that you would need to close that feedback loop. That's the only caveat I would add.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):
There's also this, feels like, straw man argument of evals versus A-B tests. Talk about your thoughts there, because that feels like a big part of this debate. People are having like, "Do you need evals if you have A-B tests that are testing production level metrics?"

Shreya Shankar (01:16:38):
A-B tests are, again, another form of evals ,I imagine, right? When you're doing an A-B test, you have two different experimental conditions and then you have a metric that quantifies the success of something, and you're comparing the metric. Again, an eval in our mind is systematic measurement of quality, some metric. You can't really do an A-B test without the eval to compare, so maybe we just have a different weird take on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Yeah, okay. What I'm hearing is you consider A-B tests as part of the suite of evals that you do. I think when people think A-B tests, it's like we're changing something in the product, we're going to see if this improves some metric we care about. Is that enough? Why do we need to test every little feature? If it's impacting a metric we care about as a business, we have a bunch of A-B tests that are just constantly running.

Shreya Shankar (01:17:27):
This is now a great point. I think a lot of people prematurely do A-B tests, because they've never done any error analysis in the first place. They just have hypothetically come up with their product requirements and they believe that, "We should test these things," but it turns out, when you get into the data, as Hamel showed, that the errors that you're seeing are not what you thought what the errors might be. They were these weird handoff issues or, I don't know, the text message thing was strange. I would say that, if you're going to do A-B tests and they're powered by actual error analysis as we've shown today, then that's great, go do it. But if you're just going to do them, which we find that people try to do, just want to do them based on what you hypothetically think is what is important, then I would encourage people to go and rethink that and ground your hypotheses.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:23):
Do you have thoughts on what Statsig is going to do at OpenAI? Is there anything there that's interesting? That was a big deal, a huge acquisition. A- B test company people are like, "A-B test, the future." Thoughts?

Hamel Husain (01:18:34):
Just to add to the previous question a little bit, why is there this debate, A-B testing versus evals? I think, fundamentally, evals is... People are trying to wrap their head around how to improve their applications and fundamentally need to do... Data science is useful in products. Looking at data, doing data analytics. There's many different suite of tools, and you don't need to invent anything new. Sure, you don't need necessarily the whole breadth of data science, and it looks slightly different, just slightly, with LLMs. Your tactics might be different, so really what it is is using analytic tools to understand your product. Now, people say the word "Evals," trying to carve out this new thing, and saying evals and then A-B testing, but if you zoom out, it's the same data science as before, and I think that's what's causing the confusion is, "Hey, we need data science thinking," and AI product is helpful to have that thinking in AI products like it is in any product is my take on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:50):
That's a really good take, I think just the word "Evals" triggers people now.

Shreya Shankar (01:19:53):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:53):
If you just call it, "We're just doing error analysis, doing data science to understand where our product breaks and just setting up tests to make sure we know-"

Shreya Shankar (01:20:00):
That's boring, sounds boring. No, no, no. We need a mysterious term, like "Evals," to really get the momentum going. Your question about Statsig, I think it's very exciting. To be honest, I don't know much about it, because I just imagine that they're this company that... There's a tool that many people use, and maybe it just so happened that OpenAI acquired them. I'm sure they've been using them in the past, I'm sure OpenAI's competitors are using Statsig as well, so maybe there is something strategic in that acquisition. I have no idea, I don't know anything there, but I think those are really the bigger questions for me than, "Is this fundamentally changing A-B testing or making evals more of a priority?" I think they've always been a priority, I think OpenAI has always been doing some form of them, and OpenAI has gone so far, historically speaking, as to go and look at all the Twitter sentiment and try to do some retrospective on that, and then tie that back to their products. Certainly, they're doing-

Shreya Shankar (01:21:00):
Then, tie that back to their products. Certainly, they're doing some amount of evals before they ship their new foundation models, but they're going so much beyond and being like, "Okay, let's find all the tweets that are complaining about it, all the Reddit threads that are complaining about it, and go try to figure out what's going on." It goes to show that evals are very, very important. No one has really figured it out yet. People are using all the available sources signal that they can to improve their products.

Hamel Husain (01:21:26):
What I'll say is I'm really hopeful that it might shift or create a focus within OpenAI, hopefully. Up until now, a lot of the big labs understandably focused on general benchmarks like MMLU score, human eval, things like that, which are very important for foundation models. Those not very related to product specific evals, like the ones we talked about today, but handoff and stuff like that, they tend not to correlate.

Shreya Shankar (01:22:01):
Yeah, they don't correlate with math problem-solving, sorry to say.

Hamel Husain (01:22:06):
Exactly. If you look at the eval products, let's say the ones up until recently that some of the big labs have, they don't have error analysis. They have a suite of generic tools, cosine similarity, hallucination score, whatever, and that doesn't work. It's a good first stab at it. It's okay. At least you're doing something, getting people, maybe it's like getting people look at data. But eventually, what we hope to see is, okay, a bit more data science thinking in this eval process. That's hopefully the tools we'll get to.

Shreya Shankar (01:22:44):
Yeah, Pamela and I should not be the only two people on the planet that are promoting a structured way of thinking about application specific evals. It's mind-boggling to me. Why are we the only two people doing this the whole world? What's wrong? I hope that we're not the only people and that more people catch on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:04):
The fact that your course on Maven is the number one highest grossing course in Maven, clearly there's demand and interest, and there's more people I think on your side. Interestingly, just as an example you've been sharing on Twitter that I think is informative, everyone's been saying how cloud code doesn't care about evals. They're all about vibes, and everyone's like, and they're the best coding agent out there, so clearly, this is right. More recently, there's all this talk about Codex, OpenAI Codex being better and everyone's switching and they're so pro evals.

Shreya Shankar (01:23:33):
I know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:34):
Yeah.

Shreya Shankar (01:23:38):
It gets me every time. The Internet's so inconsistent. My favorite thing was yesterday, I believe, a couple of lab mates and I were out getting dessert or something, and somebody said like, "Oh, do you like Codex or Claude better or whatever?" The other person said, "Oh, I like Claude." Then, someone else said, "But the new version of Codex is better." Then, the first person said, "Oh, but the last I checked was two days ago, so maybe my thoughts, maybe I'm not up-to-date." I was like, "Oh, my God."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:14):
So true, so true. This is the world we live in. Oh, my God. Okay. I want to ask about just top misconceptions people have with evals and top tips and tricks for being successful. Maybe just share one or two each of each. Let me just start with misconceptions, and maybe I'll go to the Hamel first. Just what are a couple of the most common misconceptions people have with eval still?

Hamel Husain (01:24:31):
The top one is, "Hey, I can just buy a tool, plug it in, and it'll do the eval for you. Why do I have to worry about this? We live in the age of AI. Can't the AI just eval it?" That's the most common misconception, and people want that so much that people do sell it, but it doesn't work. That's the first one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:55):
Shoot, many humans are still great. I think that's great news.

Hamel Husain (01:25:00):
The second one that I see a lot is, "Hey, just not looking at the data." In my consulting, people come to me with problems all the time, and the first thing I'll say is, "Let's go look at your traces." You can see their eyes pop open and be like, "What do you mean?" I'm like, "Yeah, let's look at it right now." They're surprised that I am going to go look at individual traces, and it always 100% of the time learn a lot and figure out what the problem is. I think people just don't know how powerful looking at the data is like we showed on this podcast.

Shreya Shankar (01:25:48):
I would agree with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:50):
Those are the top two? Okay.

Shreya Shankar (01:25:51):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:51):
Is there anything else or those are the ones solve those problems.

Shreya Shankar (01:25:55):
Oh, those are definitely... Then, I guess the third one I would add is, there's no one correct way to do evals. There are many incorrect ways of doing evals, but there are also many correct ways of doing it. You got to think about where you are at with your product, how much resources you have, and figure out the plan that works best for you. It'll always involve some form of error analysis as we showed today, but how you operationalize those metrics is going to change based on where you're at.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:28):
Amazing. Okay. What are a couple of just tips and tricks you want to leave people with as they start on their eval journey or just try to get better at something they're already doing?

Shreya Shankar (01:26:37):
Tip number one is just don't be alarmed or don't be scared of looking at your data. The process, we try to make it as structured as possible. There are inevitably questions that are going to come up. That's totally fine. You might feel like you're not doing it perfectly. That's also fine. The goal is not to do evals perfectly, it's to actionably improve your product. We guarantee you, no matter what you do, if you're doing parts of these process, you're going to find ways of actionable improvement, and then you're going to iterate on your own process from there.

(01:27:14):
The other tip that I would say is, we are very pro-AI. Use LLMs to help you organize any thoughts that you have throughout this entire process. This could be everything ranging from initial product requirements. Figure out how to organize them for yourself. Figure out how to improve on that product requirements doc based on the open codes that you've created. Don't be afraid to use AI in ways that present information better for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:44):
Sweet, so don't be scared. Use LLMs as much as you can throughout the process.

Shreya Shankar (01:27:48):
But not to replace yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:51):
Right. Okay, great. There's still jobs. It's great. Hamel.

Hamel Husain (01:27:55):
Yeah. Let me actually share my screen, because I want to show something. To piggyback of what Shreya said is, if you heard any phrase in this podcast, you've probably heard look at your data more than anything else. It's so important that we teach that you should create your own tools to make it as easy as possible. I showed you some tools when we're going through the live example of how to annotate data. Most of the people I work with, they realize how important this is and they vibe code their own tools, or we shouldn't say vibe code. They make their own tools, and it's cheaper than ever before because you have AI that can help you.

(01:28:40):
AI is really good at creating simple web applications that can show you data, that can write to a database. It's very simple. For the Nurture Boss use case, we wanted to remove all the friction of looking at data. What you see here is just some screenshots of what the application that they created looks like. It's just, "Okay, they have the different channels, voice, email, text. They have the different threads, they hid the system prompt by default." Little quality of life improvements. Then, they actually have this axial coding part here where you can see in red the count of different errors. They automated that part in a nice way and they created this within a few hours. It's really hard to have a one size fits all thing for looking at your data. You don't have to go here immediately, but something to think about is make it as easy as possible because, again, it's the most powerful activity that you can engage in. It's the highest ROI activity you can engage in. With AI, yeah, just remove all the friction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:56):
That's amazing. Again, I think that ROI piece is so important. We haven't even touched on this enough. The goal here is to make your product better, which will make your business more successful. This isn't just a little exercise to catch bugs and things like that. This is the way to make AI products better because the experience is how users interact with your AI.

Hamel Husain (01:30:16):
Absolutely. If any, we teach our students, "Hey, when you're doing these evals, if you see something that's wrong, just go fix it." The whole point is not to have evals, a beautiful eval suite, where you can point at it, edit it and say, Oh, look at my evals." No, just fix your application, make it better. If it's obvious, do it. Totally agree with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:38):
Amazing. A question I didn't ask, but this is I think something people are thinking about. How long do you spend on this? How long does it usually take to do? The first time

Shreya Shankar (01:30:45):
I can answer for myself for applications that I work with. Usually, I'll spend three to four days really working with whoever to do initial rounds of error analysis. A lot of labeling, feel like we're in a good place to create the spreadsheet that Hamel had and everyone's on-board and convinced, and even a few LLM judge evaluators. But this is one-time cost. Once I figured out how to integrate that in unit tests, or I have a script that automatically runs it on samples and I'll create a Cron Job to just do this every week. I would say it's like, I don't know, I find myself probably spending more time looking at data because I'm just data hungry like that. I'm so curious.

(01:31:23):
I'm like, I've gained so much from this process and it's put me above and beyond in any of my collaborations with folks, so I want to keep doing it, but I don't have to. I would say maybe 30 minutes a week after that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:41):
It's a week essentially, a week essentially upfront, and then 30 minutes to keep improving on adding to your suite?

Shreya Shankar (01:31:47):
Yeah, it's really not that much time. I think people just get overwhelmed by how much time they spend up front and then thinking that they have to keep doing this all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:56):
Amazing. Is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with? Anything else you wanted to double down as a point before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Hamel Husain (01:32:06):
I would say this process is a lot of fun, actually. It's like, okay, you're looking at data. Oh, it sounds like you're annotating things. Okay. Actually, I was just looking at a client's data yesterday, the same exact process. It's a application that sends emails, recruiting emails to try to get candidates to apply for a job. We decided to start looking at traces. We jumped right into it. "Hey, let's look at your traces." We looked at a trace, the first thing I saw was this email that is worded, "Given your background, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I asked the person right away, and this is where putting your product hat on and just being critical, and this is where the fun part is.

(01:32:55):
I said, "You know what? I hate this email. Do you like the email, given your background?" When I receive a message given your background, comma, I just delete that. I'm like, "What is this, given your background with machine learning and blah blah?" I'm like, "This is a generic thing." I asked the person like, "Hey, can we do better than this? This sounds like generic recruiting." They're like, "Oh, yeah, maybe." Because they were proud of it, they're like, "The AI is doing the right thing, it's sending this email with the right information, with the right link, with the right name, everything." That's where the fun part is, is put your product hat on and get into, is this really good?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:38):
Something I want to make sure we cover before we get to a very exciting lightning round is, this is just scratching the surface of all the things you need to know to do this well. I think this is the best primer I've ever seen on how to do this well.

Shreya Shankar (01:33:51):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:51):
But I think we did it. But you guys teach a course that goes much, much deeper for people that really want to get good at this and take this really seriously. Share what else you teach in the course that we didn't cover, and what else you get as a student being part of the course you teach at Maven.

Shreya Shankar (01:34:07):
Yeah, I can talk about the syllabus a little bit, and then Hamel can talk about all the perks. We go through a lifecycle of error analysis, then automated evaluators, then how to improve your application, how do you create that flywheel for yourself? We also have a few special topics that we find pretty much no one has ever heard of or taught before, which is exciting. One is, how do you build your own interfaces for error analysis? We go through actual interfaces that we've built and we also live code them on the spot for new data. We show how we use Claude code cursor, whatever we're feeling in the moment that day to build these interfaces.

(01:34:49):
We also talk about broadly cost-optimization as well. A couple of people that I've worked with, they get to a point where their evals are very good, their product is very good, but it's all very expensive because they're using state-of-the-art models. How can we replace certain uses of the most expensive GPT-5, with 5-nano, 4-mini whatnot and save a lot of money, but still maintain the same quality? We also give some tips for that. Hamel, you're on. We also have many perks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:23):
Yeah. Talk about the perks.

Hamel Husain (01:35:24):
Okay, the perks. My favorite perk is there's 160 page book that's meticulously written, that we've created, that walks through the entire process in detail of how to do evals that supplement the course. You don't have to sit there and take all these notes. We've done all the hard work for you and we have documented it in detail and organize things. That is really useful. Another really interesting thing, and something that I got the idea from you, Lenny, is, okay, this is an AI course. Education shouldn't be this thing where you are only watching lectures and doing homework assignments. Students should have access to an AI that also helps them. What we have done is we've, just like there's the LennyBot that you have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:19):
Dot com.

Hamel Husain (01:36:20):
Yeah, lennybot.com, we have made the same thing with the same software that you're using, and we have put everything we've ever said about evals into that. Every single lesson, every office hours, every Discord chat, any blogs, papers, anything that we've ever said publicly and within our course, we've put it in there. We've tested it with a bunch of students and they've said it's helpful. We're giving all students 10 months free unlimited access to that alongside the course.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:56):
Amazing. Then, you'll charge for that later down the road?

Hamel Husain (01:37:01):
I have no idea. I just take one month at a time. I don't know where we're going with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:04):
Eight months and then we'll have to figure it out. I was thinking this whole interview should have just been our bots talking to each other.

Shreya Shankar (01:37:09):
That's amazing. I would watch that, only for 10 minutes then I don't know what they're talking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:14):
Yeah, maybe 30 seconds. Do you guys train it on the voice mode, by the way? That's my favorite feature of Delphi's product. If not, you should do that.

Hamel Husain (01:37:22):
Oh, I think, I can't remember, I should look at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:26):
You definitely should. Now that we have this podcast episode, you could use this content to train it. It's 11Labs powered. It's so good. Okay, so how do they get to... I guess that's okay. They get to that once they become, enter your course.

Shreya Shankar (01:37:38):
Yeah, sign up for the course and then you'll get a bunch of emails. Everything will be clear, hopefully.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:43):
Amazing. Okay.

Shreya Shankar (01:37:44):
We also have a Discord of all the students who have ever taken the class. That Discord is so active. I can't go on vacation without getting notified on the plane.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:55):
Bittersweet, bittersweet. Incredible. Okay. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Shreya Shankar (01:38:04):
Yes. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:05):
Let's do it. Okay. I'm going to bounce between you two. Share something if you want. You can pass if you want. First question, Shreya, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Shreya Shankar (01:38:17):
I like to recommend a fiction book because life is about more than evals. Recently, I read Pachinko by Min Jin Lee. A really great book. Then, I also am currently reading Apple in China, which the name of the author is slipping my mind, but this is more of an exposition, written by a journalist on how Apple did a lot of manufacturing processes in Asia over the last couple, several decades. Very eye-opening.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:49):
Amazing. Hamel.

Hamel Husain (01:38:52):
Yeah, I have them right here. I'm a nerd. Okay, so I'm not as cool as Shreya is. I actually have textbooks, which are my favorite. This one is a very classic one, Machine Learning by Mitchell. Now, it's theoretical, but the thing I like about it is it really drives home the fact that Occam's razor is prevalent not only in science, but also in machine learning and AI. A lot of times the simplest, and also engineering, so a lot of times the simpler approach generalizes better. That's the thing I internalize deeply from that book. I also really like this one. Another textbook. I told you I'm a nerd. This is also a very old one, and this is Norvig algorithms. I really like it because it's just human ingenuity and it's lots of clever useful things in computing.

Shreya Shankar (01:39:49):
They're down the street, him and Berkeley.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:54):
The people that did that research?

Shreya Shankar (01:39:57):
Yeah, textbook authors.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:58):
Super cool. Oh, man, nerds, I love it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show? I'll jump to Hamel first.

Hamel Husain (01:40:06):
Okay, so I'm a dad of two parents. I have two parents. Sorry, two kids. Yeah, I'm a dad of two kids, and I don't really get the time to watch any TV or movies, so I watch whatever my kids are watching. I've watched Frozen three times in the last week.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:25):
Only three? Oh, okay. In the last week. Okay.

Hamel Husain (01:40:30):
That's my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:30):
Great, Hamel. Frozen. I love it. Okay, Shreya.

Shreya Shankar (01:40:32):
Yeah, I don't have kids, so I can give all these amazing answers. Actually, so my husband and I have been watching The Wire recently. We never actually saw it growing up, so we started watching it and it's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:46):
I feel like everyone goes through that. Eventually in their life they decide, I will watch The Wire.

Shreya Shankar (01:40:51):
I know, so we are in that right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:51):
It's like a year of your life. It's great. It's such a great show. Oh, man. But it's so many episodes and everyone's an hour long.

Shreya Shankar (01:40:58):
I know. I know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:58):
It's such a commitment.

Shreya Shankar (01:40:59):
We get through two or three a week, so we're very slow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:03):
Worth it. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? We'll start with Shreya.

Shreya Shankar (01:41:10):
Yeah. I really like using Cursor, honestly. Now, Claude Code. I'll say why. I'm a researcher more so than anything else. I write papers, I write code, I build systems, everything, and I find that a tool... I'm so bullish on AI assisted coding because I have to wear a lot of hats all the time. Now, I can be more ambitious with the things that I build and write papers about, so I'm super excited about those. Cursor was my entry point into this, but I'm starting to find myself always trying to keep up with all these AI assisted coding tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:48):
Hamel?

Hamel Husain (01:41:49):
Yeah, I really like Claude Code and I like it because I feel like the UX is outstanding. There's a lot of love that went into that. It's just really impressive as a terminal application that is that nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:04):
Ironic that you two both love Claude Code when it's just built on vibes.

Shreya Shankar (01:42:09):
I think it's false. It's not just built on vibes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):
There we go. Okay, two more questions. Hamel, do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using in coming back to in work or in life?

Hamel Husain (01:42:21):
Keep learning in. Think like a beginner.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:26):
Beautiful. Shreya?

Shreya Shankar (01:42:27):
I like that. For me, it's to always try to think about the other side's argument. I find myself sometimes just encountering arguments on the internet, like this race to eval debates and really think, "Okay, put myself in their shoes. There's probably a generous take, generous interpretation." I think we're all much stronger together than if we start picking fights. My vision for evals is not that Hamel and I become billionaires. It is that everyone can build AI products, and we're all on the same page

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:59):
Slash everyone becomes billionaires.

Shreya Shankar (01:43:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:04):
Amazing. Final question. When I have two guests on, I always like to ask this question and I'll start with Hamel. What's something about Shreya that you like most? What do you like most about Shreya? I'm going to ask her the same question in reverse.

Hamel Husain (01:43:18):
Yeah. Shreya is one of the wisest people that I know, especially for being so young relative to me. I feel like she's much wiser than I am, honestly, seriously. She's very grounded and has a very even perspective on things. I'm just really impressed by that all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:18):
Shreya?

Shreya Shankar (01:43:43):
Yeah. My favorite thing about Hamel is his energy. I don't know anybody who consistently maintains momentum and energy like Hamel does. I often think that I would start carrying much less about evals, if not for Hamel. Everyone needs a Hamel in their life, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):
Well, we all have a Hamel in our life now. This was incredible. This was everything I'd hoped it'd be. I feel like this is the most interesting in-depth consumable primer on evals that I've ever seen. I'm really thankful you two made time for this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you? Where can they find the course and how can listeners be useful to you? I'll start with Shreya.

Shreya Shankar (01:44:29):
Yeah, you can reach me via email. It's on my website. If you Google my name, that is the easiest way to get to my website. You can find the course if you Google AI Evals for engineers and product managers, or just AI Evals course, you'll find it. We'll send some links hopefully after this, so it's easy. How to be helpful? Two things always for me. One is ask me questions when you have them. I'll try to get to the respond as soon as I can. The other one is tell us your successes. One of the things that keeps us going is somebody tells us what they implemented or what they did, a real case study. Hamel and I gets so excited from these and it really keeps us going, so please share.

Hamel Husain (01:45:16):
Yeah, it's pretty easy to find me. My website is Hamel.dev. I'll give you the link. You can find me on social media, LinkedIn, Twitter. The thing that's most helpful is to echo what Shreya said, we would be delighted if we are not the only people teaching evals. We would love other people teach evals. Any kind of blog posts, writing, especially that as you go through this and learn this that you want to share, we would be delighted to help re-share that or amplify that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:54):
Amazing. Very generous. Thank you two, so much for being here. I really appreciate it, and you guys have a lot going on, so thank you.

Shreya Shankar (01:46:01):
Thanks, Lenny, for having us and for all the compliments.

## Transcript

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:00):
Warren Buffett famously said, in business.

Audio (00:00:02):
I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:04):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle, you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
So in a lot of decks it's like, "Oh, we have the most amazing team. We move the fastest." You mention how rarely is that actually a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:20):
You're on a treadmill and if you stop running on that treadmill, you get creamed, but it's not power. The things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
Let's actually talk about achieving these powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:32):
There's a thing called power progression. There are times when certain types of power are available. The path to power is where the rubber meets the road.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
Today my guest is Hamilton Helmer. Hamilton is a legend in the world of strategy. He's the author of 7 Powers, which outlines a framework for identifying and developing sustainable competitive advantage. It is widely considered to be the best book on strategy and people like Patrick Carlson, Peter Thiel, Reed Hastings, Daniel Eck, and so many more leaders credit the book and Hamilton's teachings for helping them build durable lasting companies. In our conversation, Hamilton shares what sources of power startups can start developing early, which types of power companies often think they have but they don't, how power relates to strategy and moats, when to start thinking about power as a startup and also what individual product managers and non-leaders can do about these insights about power. Also, how Hamilton sees AI impacting various entry and the sources of power. He also gives a preview of his new book that he's working on currently and so much more.

(00:01:40):

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:12):
Hi Lenny, a pleasure to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:14):
It's even more my pleasure. I want to start by talking about when power becomes important. When do you recommend founders start thinking about power in terms of pre-product market fit, post-product market fit? Is it worth spending time thinking about power early? Obviously it's good to think about a little bit, but how much and how seriously should founders be thinking about it before they found something that people actually want?

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:38):
One of the things that has really surprised me in the last five years has been that my understanding of the answer to that question has changed. And before I thought it was you do product market fit and then you do strategy, and if you try and put strategy before product market fit, it is not much you can do with it. That's wrong. Actually, I mentioned before one of the great pleasures for me in my work is being able to talk to company founders and one of the things that has surprised me is that conversations with them, even at an early stage about strategic matters have a richness and relevance to me that was unexpected.

(00:05:41):
And founders are practical people. I mean it's very hard to do what they're doing and they have to be extremely focused and choose what's worthwhile spending time on. And so in observing their reactions and that dialogue, I could see that there was something going on that was meaningful to them. And this second book we're working on, we'll tease out why that's so more, but the answer to your question is when should you thinking about this? The answer is always. And that's an odd answer. And so even before you have product-market fit, it's worth thinking about strategy. Now it's not strategy in the sense of this fully articulated strategic planning, we're going to do this, these are going to be the competitors, this is how we're going to answer them. This is how we'll price. Not like that at all. At the earlier stage, you can imagine wildly more degrees of freedom and the questions are of the business propositions that you're thinking of in trying to get to product-market fit, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?

(00:07:10):
And those actually are meaningful conversations and certainly by no means certain. You're tilting probabilities, you're not creating a determinative things. And then later on, once you've already have product-market fit, then you have to understand your source of power to understand what competitive position is because then you have to establish that. And then later on in a more stable phase when you're in a stability phase of business, you have to know what your source of power is if you have one, because you have to know how to defend it. And then also it is also the foundational knowledge that you need for if there's another step. Because another thing that's quite surprising about iconic businesses is they often have a second act or a third act or fourth act. I mean think of AWS or Intel going into CPUs or Apple going into iPhones, all not the origin of business. And that's actually common, not unusual, and that's starting the process all over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:24):
Awesome. You mentioned this word strategy. I want to set a little foundation here. How does strategy relate to power when people are thinking about these two concepts? And then do you have just a nice definition of what strategy is? Everyone's always just like, "What the heck do you mean when you're talking about the strategy?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:08:41):
As I said, I'm a concept person and so when you develop concepts, you have to be very highly constrained by their usefulness. I'm a great fan of the great mathematician, John von Neumann, and he had a view which really irritated a lot of mathematicians, which is that if mathematics wasn't guided by what was useful, it would become, I think the word he used was aesthetic to aesthetic. And so any concept developments like that, it needs to be guided by usefulness. And so in dealing with strategy, the question is what domain of things do you want to include in that conversation? Because the term is ubiquitous in business. I mean do a Google search sometime. I've done one recently on Google Scholar for the word strategy and you'll get a million, I'm not exaggerating, a million hits. And so strategy for some people might mean everything that gets to the pile, it gets to the top of a pile in terms of what you have to do that year.

(00:09:58):
Everything is... And that's a perfectly legitimate definition, but what I have found is that there is a very important narrowing that makes it much more useful. So that's coming back to what I was saying [inaudible 00:10:17] makes it much more useful to the business. So my view is that you want to focus, it's very useful for a business to focus on the fundamental determinants of business value and that's an arbitrary choice. It could be something else, but I can tell you from decades of business experience that that narrowing is very useful. And then so once you make that... Once you reach that understanding, it tells you some important things. So if you understand what drives business value, I mean if you do the math of it right, it's NPV of cash flow, right? Expected cash flow. And what that tells you is that strategy is a long time concept. You're looking far out in the future.

(00:11:10):
So think of Pearl Harbor, Pearl Harbor for the Japanese was this enormous tactical success. They just destroyed the US ability, naval ability in the Pacific Ocean and the worst possible strategic move because it completely solved Franklin Delano Roosevelt's problem of how he could get the US citizens on board to attacking Hitler. The strategy of it was US's industrial might would eventually win the war and population. And the difference there is time constant, tactical short, strategy long. And so if you focus on value that narrows what you think about and allows you to get rather concise and offer up advice to founders about what they need to pay attention to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
So then how specifically is power informing strategies? Like the way you think about it, focus on your power and that will inform your strategy?

Hamilton Helmer (00:12:17):
Earlier I talked about these economic structures that provide durability of return in terms of refuge from withering arbitrage of everybody who wants to eat your lunch. And so that's what power is. So you have to understand what is an economics? You're asking me questions that get pretty deep into theory or I hope you don't, this is too conceptual. But you have to say, you have to understand how competition takes place and say what is it that creates some kind of refuge? And what it is is there's something in what you do that gives you either a cost or price advantage over others. So let's say you're lower cost and that's the benefit. And the barrier side is that there's something that is durable about that that makes it over time that you can't, the competitors can't take away from you. So benefit and a barrier, we call it the to be or not to be test. And if you have that, you can think of that immediately translating into a value because that will give you good margins out into the foreseeable future, which is what you're after.

(00:13:44):
I don't know if that's... We're getting into the weeds here, but that's what it's about. And so power is those structures. Let me give you a quick example. So one I use in the book. So Netflix with scale economies, they have more subscribers. The cost of their content is a very large fixed cost, about 50% of their cost structure every year. They can take that fixed cost and spread it over more subscribers so their cost per subscriber is less versus somebody with fewer subscribers. So if they face the same prices for subscriptions as their competitors, they will be more profitable. And that's a scale economy and that's an example of a type of power and a common one I'd say. But these things are hard to achieve, right? Because there's the holy grail.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:47):
So let's actually talk about achieving these powers. Essentially the argument here is your power informs everything you do because this is the thing that'll allow you to stay durable and competitive and last. There's seven powers. We're not going to talk about all of them. If you want to go understand each of them, go read the book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:07):
Yeah. Let's not. That conversation always goes too long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Yeah, exactly. So what I'm wondering is, okay, so say you're looking at this list of seven powers and you're a specific type of startup, do you have a heuristic that tells you here's most likely the power and set of subsets that will most likely be an option for you? Like B2B SaaS companies, is there a smaller subset? Probably one of these has to be one of your options versus B2C.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:32):
That's a great question Lenny, because I think the path to power is where the rubber meets the road and it's very complicated and nuanced. But I'll give you a few thoughts along it and frankly our next book, the Second Invention, that's what it's about. It's about power, the entire book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
[Inaudible 00:15:56] I'll try to read it.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:58):
So in a book there's a thing called power progression, which says there are... It tells over the cycle of a business, there are times when certain types of power are available and the converse of that is times when they're not available. And so there's some that only are really available in when you reach a stability phase of a business pretty far out there.

(00:16:25):
And so if you're starting a company, take those off the table. So those two are branding and process power. So often I find that there's a confusion about this because brand recognition for a startup may be incredibly important, but you can get brand recognition by buying an ad in the Super Bowl. That's not power, that you paid for it. So take branding and process power and process power is really operational excellence on steroids and usually is imitable, so it's usually not.

(00:17:05):
So take those off the table and then a resource type of power, which is you have something that is of value that if you transferred it to somebody else it would be of value to them, but you own the rights. So the barrier is law for example, or lack of knowledge from others. And there are classes of businesses that are like that. So prescription pharmaceuticals, if you are the first person to come up with Viagra, that's worth a lot of money. If you took that license and gave it to somebody else, it'd be worth a lot of money to them. But that's a different class and it's usually not the types of things that I'm dealing with and it's obvious to everybody. So the key challenge there is can you invent a pharmaceutical that's effective for a large market. So you can take those three off the table and that then leaves counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs and network economies.

(00:18:13):
And the important thing to keep in mind there is that they're sequenced. So almost every startup that you want to deal with starts with counter positioning because remember what product market fit is primarily is a substitution. You are coming up with a way to satisfy a more or less existing need in a novel way that creates more value. Now sometimes you tap into entirely new needs, but it's not so often. I mean Amazon was up against brick and mortar stores, Google was up against Yahoo and so on, and so you're usually substituting and that substitution, so your competition at that point is functional competition.

(00:19:19):
And if you don't have counter positioning at that point you're pretty high risk from an incumbent who already has the capabilities necessary to do that. They just have to extend their product or do this or that, but counter positioning is the refuge from that. And then you go into the other three types of power scale economies, switching costs and network economies, and those depend on your scale relative to competitors. This is pretty cursory, but that's what I'd say. I'll focus on those four and I would recommend that you think pretty hard about whether you think you have counter positioning to start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:08):
Awesome. I actually want to double down on that thread, but just to summarize, I have the list here. Basically you're saying if you're an early stage startup, the four to really that are actually potential powers for you at least early on, counter positioning, which your point is you could just start with that. That's essentially positioning and business model design, which happens at the beginning and then you can start to think about network economy, scale economy, switching costs as powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:33):
Right. And you've done the right thing by not having me go through and define each of those. But your listeners will need to go back to my book and see what those things are to get... We're going through the shorthand as we should, but all of what we've said won't be completely obvious to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:54):
Yeah, I think a simple Google search I find just gives you a very simple definition of these.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:58):
Yeah, that's right. There's some people who have done some really good summaries of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Or ChatGPT, even better in a lot of cases.

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:05):
ChatGPT if they get it right sometimes I find they hallucinate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Hallucinate an eighth power. You mentioned how some companies think they have a certain power or it's common to think you have a certain power. If you look at every startup deck, there's always like, "Here's our moat, here's the way we're going to have barriers to entry." I'm guessing in almost every case they're delusional about the power that they actually have and the power they think they'll have. Do you also find that to be true that often founders are wrong about how much barrier they've actually created and is there a power you often find most wrong and mistaken?

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:43):
Yeah, so I agree with your observation, but I don't want to be unkind. So I mean there are two things to keep in mind here in terms of making people feel better about that incorrect slide in the deck. One is that founders have to be optimistic. I think it's an important quality that they maybe understate the risk a little bit, but they're so committed to I'm going to do this thing that they go through that and that may give them an advantage over a large corporation trying to do the same thing. The other is that despite the name 7 Powers, which makes it sound like, oh, you can sort this out. Actually understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard. I mean I did it with my colleagues here at Strategy Capital and we're looking at a well-known company, it might take us weeks to answer that question for a single company.

(00:22:47):
And it comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard. So with those caveats that... Give them some courtesy, I'll say some of the obvious ones are I mentioned before, people sometimes think they have branding power, but another one that I think I've heard you mention is people often think that they get scale economies through data. And I'd say that that's possible, but it's rare. And the reason it's rare is not because there aren't scale economies in data, but rather that the range of scale that the existing competitors have are often large enough to be able to put them in shouting distance of each so that the differences in their cost per unit is not that great.

(00:23:50):
The curve flattens in other words, which is typical of any, because the most common scale economy is you've got a big fixed cost and you prorate that. And as you get more and more scale, the percentage cost advantage of a fixed cost advantage like that goes down and that often. So that's a pretty frequent one that we see. We laugh whenever we hear somebody say they have a flywheel, which gives you the idea of network economies. There are often flywheels, the ones that really are material, are rare. The key thing here is materiality, not whether the flywheel exists, but whether the effect is strong enough to really tilt returns.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
I was actually going to ask about that one because in software and social consumer products, network effects is always the pitch. Once we get big enough, we create this huge barrier. You mentioned just now you often find that's not actually true. It's rarely something that'll become a barrier. Is there anything else you find with network? And I know your power is called network economies, not network effect. I guess just to be clear, are these the same thing in your mind with different words?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:02):
Yeah, kind of. I mean I have called it a type of power. So for me it's only those things which clear the significance barrier, hurdle rather that they're a large material. And so there are lots of things that I would say have network effects but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:26):
Oh, interesting. Wait, can you speak to that? So there is a difference between these terms, network economies?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:30):
Yeah. So for me the difference is materiality is that whether the value benefit is large enough to engender a price delta significant enough to give you materially different margins into the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:50):
Basically, does that network effect have an actual impact on your business and your ability to price?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:55):
Yeah, it's not an impact, it's a material impact. So it could have... If it's a penny to your bottom line, that's one thing if it's a billion dollars or something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:06):
Wow, that's actually really interesting. Is there an example of a company that comes to mind, they had network effects but not network economies as a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:12):
I think you could turn almost anywhere and get some modest network effects and any platform business would probably likely have some modest network effects. You asked me earlier and you sent me about Uber and Lyft, I'd say that they probably have network effects involved but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
Wow, that's interesting. And the reason you're saying they don't have network economies is because they're still so competitive they still have to spend so much money to stay ahead and so the network is not-

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:51):
Yeah. Right. The advantage that they get, it's not material. Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Wow, that's so interesting. Along those lines, it's so interesting to see Uber and Lyft these days. In theory they both had some sort of strong network effect. I was just looking, so Lyft is 5% the market cap of Uber. Is there a lesson from just what it is that allowed Uber to just win and kind of run away with the market essentially?

Hamilton Helmer (00:27:25):
I'm not entirely sure, I'll take a guess, but take it as a unformed guess. I haven't really studied it carefully. I think that over time there, if I had to guess, I'd say they're probably modest scale economies in the business. And over time Uber has just very successfully played a war of attrition. And that's both been in how they run their... They made one initial misstep, which is they misdefined their business. They said it was international transportation and it's not. That business is extremely geographically specific.

(00:28:14):
If you have a great position in the Bay Area, it doesn't help you in London. And so their forays into China and everything really didn't make, but they pulled back on that, focused down on understanding their source of power, which was a geographically specific scale economy. And then they've done interesting things like Uber Eats where they've tried to utilize the platform that they have to get other opportunities for the one side of their platform, the drivers. And so if I had to guess, I'd say it was a well-played war of attrition with modest scale economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):
And is that attrition coming from a source of power or is that just like a broader, more strict?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:06):
Yeah, it only works because there are modest scale economies. If there weren't any then if they did all this stuff, they'd still have a global and see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):
Got it. Let me go in a slightly different direction. We've talked about power, we've talked about strategy. There's also, there's this word moat that comes up a lot. Everyone's always trying to build a moat. In your mind, is a moat equivalent to a power? Is there a difference when people talk about these two?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:30):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, you have to have something that you do that gives you a better outcome than your competitors, lower cost or higher price, and then something that makes it impossible for somebody else to mimic that. So moat is the second. So it's not synonymous with power because you can have a moat around a very undesirable piece of property and wouldn't get you far. But I think it is pretty synonymous with barrier. I think Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, I admire enormously. I think I get credit for popularizing those concepts and I think the way they think about it is good. I'd say that 7 Powers is probably more systematic and comprehensive in saying that. I don't think. This is wonderful. I don't know if you've read any of the Microsoft antitrust literature that came out of their-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
No.

Hamilton Helmer (00:30:42):
...lawsuit, but there was a communication between Bill Gates and Warren Buffett where Warren Buffett was saying why he couldn't invest in Microsoft. He just didn't understand it. And so that meant the idea of network economies and what the moat was there he didn't understand. But I think the concept of a moat is a good one. The idea that you have something that gives you a refuge from competing forces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
In terms of Warren Buffett, I found the quote about moats. Warren Buffett famously said, "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unreachable moats."

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:22):
Right. And so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:27):
Right. He's got it covered.

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:29):
But one of the tricks to understanding power is you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack. So I'll give you a Netflix example. So a company I admire a lot, and I think if some of the things that they had to do to develop their business were so important for their business that don't guarantee a castle. So for example, UI development, it's been an enormous amount of resources on trying to get just the very best UI, I mean a zillion AB tests, all kinds of things. Their recommendation engine, everybody's knows the story about how that went, their interface with the content world and all this. So those things are important. They're things they have to spend a lot of time and resources on, but they can largely be mimicked.

(00:32:31):
So when Netflix in an earlier phase was fighting Blockbuster, when Blockbuster finally threw in the towel, said, "Well, we done. Well, better do a mail or a DVD business." If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it. And so all that thoughtfulness about which things you put first and how you structure it and all that to make this suitable was mimicable. So that's an understanding of looking at the properties you have and trying to figure out if they're a castle or a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:06):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product development teams. Are your users constantly requesting new integrations with other SaaS platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native product integrations take months of engineering to build and the maintenance never ends. Paragon enables your engineering team to ship integrations seven times faster than building in-house by removing the complexities around authentication, messy third-party APIs and debugging integration errors. Engineering teams at companies like CopyAI, Cinch, TLDB and over 100 other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations.

(00:33:53):
The results, their shipping integrations on demand, which has led to higher product usage, better retention and more customer upsells. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you go to market faster with integrations today. That's use paragon.com/Lenny. So let's take this concept of 7 Powers. A lot of people listening to this are just like individual contributor product managers on teams building new products or iterating on products they already have. What do you suggest they do with this knowledge of there exists these ways to build benefits and barriers? I'm working on say a new product. What do you recommend they do? What's something they could do this week, next month to infuse these lessons into the products they're building?

Hamilton Helmer (00:34:41):
I'd say they're a few and it's a little bit different. I'm not a great fan of the strategically driven organization because that idea, because it fuzzes over how this knowledge is useful at different stages in the business. And so for somebody in that position, say a product manager in an existing successful business. So it is important in terms of just understanding their business to know what their source of power is because they... And that can inform them about what it is that they're working for. And also they may see things since they're down in the weeds, they may see things that are important to that that they need to bring to other people's attention. Because they're the ones that really have the knowledge of what the heck's going on. There's another aspect I mentioned before, this idea of transforming, of starting up entirely new things. And usually... I wouldn't say, usually I say it's not uncommon for ideas about that to bubble up from down below.

(00:36:03):
And so that's another source. So let's separate a business into three phases, origination, takeoff, and stability. So the answers I've given are more in the stability phase. In the takeoff phase, let's say you've launched a product, you've gotten customer traction, now you're in a phase where there's just very rapid growth, probably other entrants like you, what are you facing? What you're facing is remember that underneath all of this is a change in technology. That's what made the product market fit possible in the first place. But that doesn't just stop. That if you're in a technology wave, often there are all kinds of offshoots both for you and the compliments to your business and everything else going on at the same time.

(00:36:59):
And to win at that stability phase, which is really a market share win, you have to be aware of those and understand, okay, we have to incorporate this new feature. Or maybe now things have gotten to the point where this new market segment is, our product is attractive before it wasn't. This is meat and potato stuff for somebody at that level and it may well be the decisive element in terms of whether you win that market share battle with the other contenders. And so you have a very, very important role at that point. And so I'd say the first thing to do with your question is to make sure you think about the different phases of this and then ask what those responsibilities are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:51):
What about for people that are just trying to get better at being strategic, thinking strategically something every product leader is always encouraged to do, become a better strategic thinker, build as muscle of strategy, what do you often advise to people just get better at the stuff? Obviously read your book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:09):
Read the book, and then have conversations with your colleagues about the topic because as you internalize what that means and how, have conversations with them about do we really have this kind of power? What's going on here? What's important? What isn't. Those conversations tend to allow you to get a better grip on things. I mean in the case of Netflix, Reed actually had me come in and train the top a hundred people in Netflix and strategy. We actually ran classes in the company, but that's unusual I'd say. And I didn't have the book yet. And so I think the book gets people pretty far down that path already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:55):
And you don't do that anymore, I imagine if someone wanted to do that today, not an option.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:59):
I sadly don't have the time. I mean I do often do fireside chats at company meetings and that kind of thing, but not a full-blown course and I'm not teaching at Stanford anymore either. And so I don't. I enjoyed that immensely wonderful people to work with. But sadly I don't have the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
You're about to get a lot of requests for fireside chats. I hope you're ready. You mentioned AI at some point in our chat. I'm curious how you think AI is going to change your 7 Powers framework. Do you think defensibility goes down in general? Will certain forms of power become more important or harder to achieve? How do you think about AI?

Hamilton Helmer (00:39:44):
Yeah, it's a great question. I mean we're all in this phase of wondering exactly how generative AI is going to play out. My own view, currently I don't see any change in seven powers from it in terms of an eighth power or something. But the issues that it brings up, like scale economies, I mean think of scale economies. If you have a fixed cost of trying to develop a model of a billion dollars or something or network effects, will AI models develop so that they learn in a way that for one user's interaction helps another user's interaction? That would be a powerful network economy. Or if it learns, if you think of if it learns about you and becomes a better psychiatrist or something, then that's a switching cost. So all these things are relevant to which business models will work and I find that useful.

(00:40:51):
But I think in general, the way I think about it is it's a standard form of potentially very powerful technology that is being introduced into the business world and just asking how that plays out. I currently tend to think of that there's three types of plays. There's the company that's the technology play itself. So if you think of microprocessors, it would be Intel. There's the companies that wouldn't exist without the technology. So for semiconductors it would be Microsoft. And then there are the companies that utilize the technology, but it had existed before and after. So for semiconductors it would be automobiles. They used a ton of chips, but there were still cars before, after.

(00:41:48):
And so I'm of the view, I'm very much uncertain at this point that generative AI, its biggest impact will be that tertiary class. It will be used in a lot of things that existed before and exist after, but are made better by it like semiconductors and automobiles. And so it reminds me, if you think of really big technology shifts like this, it reminds me of electricity. When electricity came, you could completely reconfigure a factory floor. You no longer had to have... You could have the power source essentially at the operating unit of an operator. But that took a lot of redesign, incorporation, investment, learning, complements, all kinds of stuff. I tend to think this will be more like that. There will be some pure cases. People will want to have them write their term paper with ChatGPT or something. But if you think of businesses, it's hard for me to think of a single functional area in a business that with redesign couldn't benefit. So accounting, HR, R&D all have uses of this but requires incorporation, which is always troublesome.

(00:43:30):
And so that's my view. But there certainly will be businesses that couldn't exist without it. And there's some that are coming up and some of those are in fact the businesses that empower the tertiary need, they're the ones that bring in. But if you go back, this will date me, but if you go back into business history, back in, I guess it was the 90s, there was this thing called business process re-engineering, the idea that you could take a computer sensibility into business processes, redesign them and get these monstrous cost savings. And it was a gigantic consulting opportunity for people. Whole companies got developed based on that and it feels more like that to me, but it's very interesting. I could be wrong, but it feels different than crypto. It feels like there's more of a real ultimate use case. I mean, if it really is true what they say that a 50% improvement in programming efficacy is not uncommon, just that proposition alone is worth an awful lot of money if you think how many programmers are in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
No question. You mentioned eighth power. I just want to check, is there an emerging eighth power you wish you maybe would've included or maybe added in the future that's like, "Oh, maybe this is on the edge," or it's like, "Nope, we got these seven?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:15):
It's a great question. I'm always looking for it because if you find it it probably means it's so obscure there, it'll also be a great investment opportunity. We're looking all the time, but so far, no. So far I'm pretty satisfied that seven is an exhaustive set, but never say never. That's an empirical seven, not a theoretical seven.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):
If we start seeing you making incredible returns, you've clearly found an eighth power [inaudible 00:45:41]-

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
I want to close one thread on a power that you mentioned that is often a pitfall, which is around process power and basically execution. A lot of people think so in a lot of decks it's like, oh, we have the most amazing team, we move the fastest, we're earliest. You mentioned how rarely is that actually a power actually being able to execute and create a process that is an actual barrier? Can you just talk a bit more about that to help people understand okay, it's probably not our power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:46:09):
One of the great thinkers in strategy was this Harvard professor Michael Porter, and he in probably 40 years ago, made the very controversial statement that operational excellence is not strategy. He got a lot of people of the Harvard Business School faculty really mad at him because that's what their careers were about and it sounded like he was dissing them. But the point he was making was when you get to this end state, if you already have power that things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked because you can hire a consulting firm who has best practices, knowledges that come in and get you up to snuff. You can hire people from your competitors who know how to do it better. And that's true, but it's also true in this takeoff phase in a business that we talked about before, when you're trying to attain competitive position, operational excellence is everything.

(00:47:14):
And so if you think of strategy, not statically endpoints like Professor Porter was, but if you look at dynamically how you get there, operational excellence is essential for a strategy. So think of those things I mentioned before about Netflix, about their UI and recommendation engine and so on, or international rollout, all those things. They were in a battle to get more subscribers than other people and those were critical for that. But in themselves, they're critical in attaining competitive position, but in themselves, they're not sources of power typically, unless there's some very tight considerations here or very demanding considerations for the... Unless if they have to be material, but they also have to be opaque or some way people can't easily imitate them. Either they don't understand what's going on or they might be opaque. So for example, think of TSMC. So when they put up the latest fab and get that operational, are there a lot of steps in doing that?

(00:48:43):
They know how to do with their staff is trained to do it, but it's not documented necessarily and you can't imitate it. Then maybe they have it. I don't know if they have process power or not, but it takes that level of complexity. In my book, I use the example of Toyota and a car manufacturing is complex enough that you can have this opacity in terms of material steps, but it's not common. So if you're in a stability phase of business, you're stuck with this funny thing, which is most of your day is on those issues and it should be because if you don't do it, a competitor can and they can end up better than you. And so you're on a treadmill and that's the way business is. That's fine. And if you stop running that treadmill, you get creamed. So you got to do it, it's most of your day, but it's not power. And there are those rare cases where it's so material and so inimitable that it can be power, but they're rare.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:02):
I like the heuristic that if you haven't written it down or you can't describe it, that might be a sign that maybe process power is a power of yours.

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:13):
Yeah. And there isn't a consulting firm that offers to bring you up to speed on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:20):
They'll make you more like Amazon as a service. Kind of along these same lines, you talk about how the only things that create value in a company are power, market size and operational excellence. And I think hearing that will blow a lot of people's minds because they think there's so many things that contribute to the value of a company and you whittle it down to these three things. What can you say about that insight?

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:47):
So I'd say they're right and I'm right. They're right because there are this incredible... I mean business is really hard and there are just a multitude of things you have to pay attention for. I'm right because all those things fall into those three categories. So it's an exhaustive set and it simply comes out of the math. So we're both right I'd say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
Final question, the intent of a lot of your work is to empower founders. I'm curious if you've noticed any broad economic trends or shifts that you think will make life easier or harder for founders in the coming years?

Hamilton Helmer (00:51:32):
Personally, I am very, very concerned about the debt trajectory of the United States and of many countries around the world, but I'll pick on the United States, but it's a trend going on everywhere. We're on a trajectory for this extremely high indebtedness. And so if you think about the last 30 years, right? There's been a crisis about once every 10 years. So there's the dot-com bust, there's the financial crisis, there was COVID. Nothing makes me think that the frequency will be a lot less. I don't know what, who knows? These are all uncertain events. But imagine if we got to one of those and we had no dry powder and dry powder for us is the ability to heavily deficit spend take on debt. And fortunately our government did that in both the financial crisis and in COVID. And because that people had jobs. My own view about the financial crisis is that if we hadn't done that, plus having Ben Bernanke as the head of the Fed, we would've gone into another great depression.

(00:52:52):
It was that ugly. So this current debt trajectory, you don't know how long it will take exactly when, but eventually that will mean we will not have dry powder. People will not respect the credit worthiness of this country. So that worries me a lot. And it utterly will affect the idea of company founding because if you get into a crisis like that, the capital markets lock up and it gets very difficult to do anything. And to really stretch my credibility here, I'll opine on just how hard a problem this is to solve. The reason this is so difficult for this country to solve and other countries is that it is right at the crux of the delicate dance between capitalism and democracy. So if you think about the problem, of course that's driving all this is entitlements. There's discretionary spending, certain recovery programs and stuff, but those can go away. The underlying trend that people just can't get their arms around is entitlements. And anybody who looks at the numbers can see that. Every economist knows that. But that's not an easy fix.

(00:54:18):
And the reason it's not an easy fix is there are two opposing views of what's going on, and there's no way to resolve those two views. One is that capitalism is rapacious and results in more and more inequality and the government has to do something about it. And the other is that the government is on a path that is creeping socialism that will undermine our freedom and economic sufficiency. And the poster child for the rapacious capitalism. One is, I don't know if you've seen the recent analysis of inequality in the United States just came out, much more robust analysis. And it said that basically inequality in the last 60 years of the United States is unchanged, but that's post-transfer, post-tax inequality, which basically says the amount of taxing and transferring going on was about right. So it says that the amount we're spending is about right from that perspective, that it compensates for the other inequities and we should be spending that much so we should tax more.

(00:55:30):
And the poster child for the other point of view of the dangers of government is the steadily increasing without interruption percentage of the economy that is government. And to levels that 75 years ago, people would've thought absolutely impossible. So there are these two views about what's going on. One is that we're compensating for the normal inequities of capitalism, and the other is that we're headed down a path to socialism and ruin. And that leads to a deadlock, which is you don't tax anymore and you don't cut spending and that leaves deficits. So anyway, a long, long rant, sorry but that trend is extremely politically difficult to deal with and extremely threatening and that concerns me immensely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Not to leave listeners with a very sad state of affairs.

Hamilton Helmer (00:56:36):
Yeah, sorry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
No, no. I think this is important. I think it's important people think about this and know these things. Is there anything that gives you hope? Is there anything that gets you excited about either for founders or anyone in general, just to leave folks with maybe on a happy?

Hamilton Helmer (00:56:50):
Yeah, I mean, I am an optimist really in a way, and I do. There's a famous Austrian and eventually American economist named Joseph Schumpeter who wrote this wonderful book Theory of Economic Development way back when over a hundred years ago, where he took the unusual view of saying that the vitality of an economy depended on entrepreneurs. And I ascribe to that. I think that creativity and action are the ways society and people advance. And I think the US's and a free society has huge advantages in that. And I think that I feel very lucky to be in a place I'm in Silicon Valley, but to be in a place in a country where that is vital and active and I think that's ground zero for me. And so I think you see that alive and well, I think. And there are people that are very Enthusiastic about that as I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:12):
Beautiful way to close out our chat. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything you want to leave listeners with or any last tidbit of advice?

Hamilton Helmer (00:58:22):
I alluded to it before, but just that remember, action is the first principle of business. You do stuff and my book is very oriented towards that. The idea was not to tell you what to do, but to give you guideposts while you're on that journey. People that are enthused about it, I encourage you to do stuff. That's where it all starts and I can think about it and maybe help a little bit, but it's mostly doing stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):
I love that point so much. It was something I was going to touch on but I didn't get to is just there's so many people that just sit around and theorize about a strategy of their business, especially in their early stage. Here's our grand master plan, here's an amazing strategy or just read about startup ideas and don't actually try it. I love this final note of just try it. Just do it. Don't just sit there and-

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:18):
Yeah, yeah, just do it. And life is full of surprises. You'll end up in a place you didn't expect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
Amazing. Speaking of ending up in a place you didn't expect, it's time for our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:32):
Oh, sure. I'll do my best here. I'm not very good on lightning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:37):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:42):
One book that is extremely wonky, and I can only take it in very small doses, but is magnificent, is one called The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose, who's this brilliant mathematician. And it will be very daunting for anybody unless you're a deep math person, but his brilliance in erudition just shines through in this thing. And it's an amazing book. I would say there's another book, boy, I wish I could remember the name. Maybe you can get the name of the author called Gene by this geneticist. And I think he's a Harvard Medical School professor that's about the history of genetics and he is an absolutely luminous writer. I mean, it puts me to shame. I'm embarrassed when I read it because I think how pedestrian my writing is and incredibly knowledgeable about the history of genetics and I think that's such an important topic. So those are two that I would recommend highly, fairly wonky, but I like them both.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
I love them. The author, I just looked him up. Siddhartha Mukherjee.

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:01):
Yes. Just amazing. You read it and you go, "How did he think of that phrasing?" I mean, it's just, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:14):
I'm a huge movie fan and have been all my life, and I'm particularly keen on animated films. But the movie that I've recently seen that I liked particularly it was American Fiction. I thought that was... It didn't make any of the easy choices in a movie and as a result was just incredibly interesting and thoughtful I thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:39):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:43):
In my office, just this last week, we actually put a Persian rug in our entry room, and this is what's called a Farahan Sarouk rug and it's 150 years old. And it had an effect in me that I didn't expect, which is it is a work of great beauty. And it was before, it was all hand-done before machines. You get all this wonderful variation of the actual icons in the rug and the different dye colors. And I find that every morning when I walk in, I go, "That's really beautiful," and it's uplifting and it shows you the importance of, or the value of the quality of art. I mean, just blows my mind actually. So that's probably not the usual product discussion that you get.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:50):
No, I love that answer. Recently we've had some really unique choices. One is a very nice Mercedes and a Rivian and a minivan recently. We've got a lot of very nice things.

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:00):
Oh, that's great. I'm a car guy too, so I didn't answer on the car question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
Oh man, I love that. We have Rory Sutherland coming on the podcast soon. He is one of the leaders of Ogilvy and he has a whole thing about how buying a home is the best value of art to buy art if you live in a home that makes you feel inspired and is beautiful.

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:20):
Yeah, I'm a big believer in that. I mean, I think that your place and how you connect to it has an important grounding effect. And then before I talked earlier about creativity and I think surrounding yourself in an environment that stimulates that is really important. And so I couldn't agree with him more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:51):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to share with friends or family?

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:58):
One is what Clint Eastwood's advice to actors, which is don't just do something, stand there. And so there are a lot of things that are long-termish with low signal to noise. And you can often just do a lot of stuff that you think makes a difference, but it really doesn't. And so that's one. The other one which is somewhat more profound I think was one that I had a famous Sri Lankan journalist was a mentor of mine and very dear friend, and he had a favorite expression that I adhere to all the time, which is everything is always about something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
Wow. Deep.

Hamilton Helmer (01:04:53):
And that's so true if you're dealing with this power stuff when if you really dig down, everything is always about something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:58):
Speaking of power, final question. People that have a lot of power are leaders in the world. I'm curious, do you have a favorite historical leader?

Hamilton Helmer (01:05:07):
So yeah. I have some that I admire a great deal. I'm a tremendous fan of Winston Churchill's. Most really great people are quirky and he qualified. There are things you could say about him that you might not have liked that so much, but he was a genius and had great fortitude, human sense. He understood things long before other people. I've give him high marks. Some of the great artists I admire enormously. I'm reading a book right now on the last 20 years of Michelangelo, which wonderful book actually, and which is a very interesting period because in his first 70 years he finished up all that, he wasn't going to do sculpture anymore. He just finished The Last Judgment, which was the wall of the Sistine Chapel.

(01:06:08):
And I think the last major fresco he did. And a lot of his friends at that time, he was exiled from Florence and living in Rome and he had this Roman community and a lot of his close friends that had recently died or had difficulties. So he's at this inflection point in his life at 70, which in those days was very old, and yet he went on to do some of the most remarkable architecture in the history of the world. And so you've got to admire that. I mean, just doing that, which is that rare second act. But I think for world leaders, Winston Churchill is very high. I'm a fan of Teddy Roosevelt, I must say too, in this country.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):
I love that. Hamilton, you are wonderful. I feel like we have helped a lot of people up-level their ability to think about strategy and moats and power. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find more online if they want to dig in further, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Hamilton Helmer (01:07:15):
Yeah, so as I say, I'm an idea person and I'm about trying to empower company founders, and so only thing I can say is read the book, spread the ideas, start your own company. Those are the things that would make me happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):
Amazing. Hamilton, Thank you so much for being here.

Hamilton Helmer (01:07:40):
Great. My pleasure, Lenny.

# The art and wisdom of changing teams | Heidi Helfand (Author of Dynamic Reteaming)

## Transcript

Heidi Helfand (00:00:00):
Reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer, so let's focus there too.

Lenny (00:00:25):
Today my guest is Heidi Helfand. After two decades in the tech industry, Heidi became fascinated with how teams are organized, how org structures change and how to set teams up for success through that change. She now teaches workshops and runs courses and consults on how to effectively reorganize your teams. And in her book Dynamic Reteaming, Heidi delves deep into why change is actually good for your teams, why you're better off not having super stable teams, how to effectively execute reorgs, and through that, how to reduce attrition, stagnation, and knowledge silos. In our conversation, Heidi shares the five types of reteaming, anti-patterns to avoid when making org changes, what sort of team structure is most conducive to creating totally new products, why being transparent about your reorg plans is definitely worth considering. Also, how Heidi became such a great listener with a lot of really interesting insights and advice there and so much more. Huge thank you to John Cutler for introducing me to Heidi. With that, I bring you Heidi Helfand after a short word from our sponsors.

Heidi, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Heidi Helfand (00:03:45):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:47):
It's great to have you here. So I had this colleague at Airbnb, her name was Jana, and she always had this joke that she shared that if it's been six months and she hasn't switched teams or hasn't moved desks, she knew there was this reorg coming, there's something happening, something was coming to change everything. And you wrote a whole book about this general idea of teams changing, reorgs, you call reteaming. I have the book right here. It's called Dynamic Reteaming: The Art and Wisdom of Changing Teams. I feel like just people underestimate the opportunities and benefits of change, and I think that we see it as a scary thing. So I'm really excited to spend time with you and chat about this topic. Before we get into the meat of it, I'm just curious why you decided to spend so much of your time researching this area of team change, reorgs, reteaming.

Heidi Helfand (00:04:35):
Yeah, that's a good question. It wasn't necessarily planned. I had been working in a variety of different fast-growing startups for most of my career in 20 years in software-as-a-service companies in particular. And I read a lot of books to try to get better at my work and what we're doing in our teams. I have a lot right over there as you can see, and a lot of the books I would read on teams and the advice that I would get from people would be, you really want to keep your teams the same. You want to go for that forming, storming, norming, performing kind of thing. And I had thought about that and I was like, wait, well it wasn't really possible for us when I was at a startup and I was the 10th employee and we grew to 900 people and now thousands of people, our team's kind of morphed and changed.

(00:05:28):
So I feel like if you're in a fast-growing company or a shrinking company, look there, don't look at trying to fight the natural evolution. I was just trying to prove a point and to illustrate that teams change. And I was also curious to see, well, was that just my experience and the experience of my colleagues in Southern California? What is it like for other people? So I was just curious.

Lenny (00:05:56):
You have this code in your book where you say something like, sure, we deliver software on time, we make products people love and want to buy, but there's this people layer that happens that people may not be thinking enough about. Is there anything more you can say to that?

Heidi Helfand (00:06:11):
Yeah, I think a lot of the things that I would read about teams just are naturally focused on, well, you want to build things that customers love. You want it to be an enjoyable experience, you want to deliver on time. There's a reason we're there as a business, but there's also a lot of company building that happens in building the people structures and just when you go from one to many to a multitude, there's a lot of work that goes into it. This is enablement type work and it's where I focused a lot of my time and my career helping make teams and organizations successful. So there is this people layer, however, I've thought about this a lot over the years and I think it would be highly convenient if we could just focus on building products that people love and getting product market fit, talking to customers.

(00:07:06):
It would be great if it could only be that, but the reality is we're humans together and there's a lot of opportunity to build companies that delight people where they're excited to be included in decision-making about how the organization grows and changes or shrinks. So yeah, there's this whole kind of other area of work that I think just doesn't get enough attention and I guess that's where I live and breathe.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Awesome. Okay, so I definitely want to get into the five types of reteaming as you described, but before we get there, what I find with reorgs and change is that it often leads to the biggest career opportunities because there's new roles to be filled. If things aren't changing, there's not going to be all of a sudden, "Hey, we have this new role that we want for you." I don't know. A lot of the leaders that move up quickly are the ones that seem to take advantage of change and think ahead and get involved and position themselves in a way where like, "Okay, cool, there's a new position. Oh, clearly it's going to be Heidi." Is there anything you can share there? Any advice for people that maybe see reorgs coming and what they can do to help themselves in that pending change?

Heidi Helfand (00:08:21):
I really like it when there's transparency in reorgs. There's a story in my book from Christian Lima at Spotify about how they reorged a large infrastructure team. They visualized it on whiteboards and brought people over to the whiteboards to see the future team structure that the leaders wanted and they got input into the design. We did this at Procore as well inspired by Christian and his story and we had... I think there were 80 people involved in this platform organization that was splitting from two large clusters of teams into three. And I remember when we rolled out the whiteboards from a back office where we were talking about this change for a few weeks and it was scary to roll these whiteboards out because it impacts people's day to day. It's like when somebody is suggesting that maybe you do something different or that something different happens, sometimes it can be kind of triggering. You want to know what's going on. So anyway, but we had courage together.

(00:09:31):
So we rolled these whiteboards out and it had the team structure with everyone's names on it. It had the name of the team, the mission of the team, how many open slots for hiring across all of these different teams, and then people's names in their existing team positions. And people were invited to look, give feedback. They identified mistakes that we had in the design, "Oh, this team might be better over here and here's why." And people had the opportunity to see opportunities within their own company that they might say, "Hey, I'm interested in this, might I be considered for this?" And then they could have their discussion. So I really liked that the opportunities were shared and presented, so it wasn't some sort of thing that happened in some kind of back room for the whole time. We unearthed the beginning of a plan.

(00:10:31):
I think sometimes when you convene people for a meeting to talk about anything, it's good to have a starting point. So we had this starting point, we had a variety of different things and I call it whiteboard reteaming in my book and I write about that. And there's even structures that are more open than that. Redgate Software in Cambridge UK. Chris Smith is a colleague of mine and they do regular open self-selection reteaming activities when they're changing their strategic priorities. He talks about this globally very interesting space and it's even more open than putting the names on the whiteboards. They have teams give pitches and this is what they're looking for and they have a whole method for enabling people to say, "Hey, I'm interested in this." I think that really helps because sometimes you might think, "Oh, no one's going to want to work on this." But people can be delighted by working on things that another person doesn't think are particularly interesting.

(00:11:38):
So giving choice is important. And again, there are different grades of transparency. We weren't up for doing this kind of open reteaming self-selection event, but we were open to the whiteboard variant.

Lenny (00:11:56):
I imagine individual employees hearing this of just being involved in the reorg strategy sounds amazing. Executives and leaders hearing this are probably really afraid and feel like there's no way this can work well. And so what I want to understand is how do you actually set this up for success? What I'm imagining when you do this is many people disagree. There's teams people want to join, there's teams people don't want to join. It seems like there's a consensus challenge where do you wait for everyone to agree? Does someone end up making a decision? Does it distract everyone from the work they're doing when you're kind of involving everyone in the reorg? Versus what typically happens, it secretly is planned amongst executives. No one knows it's coming. And I think the reason they do that is because they don't want to distract anyone and they don't want anyone to start freaking out until it's like, "Here's the final plan. Here's what we're doing." So what other advice do you have for people that want to practice this way of reteaming and reorging where they involve the actual team in the plan?

Heidi Helfand (00:12:58):
There's a book by William Bridges called Transitions: Managing Life's Changes. I have it right here. Making Sense of Life's Changes. He talks about endings, neutral zone, and new beginning. Ending: you're going through a change, your team is changing. Neutral zone: the period of kind of liminality where you're like, "Gosh, I don't know how this is going to go." You're not quite comfortable. You're not quite in that new reality yet. You're still thinking about what it was like before. And once you're in that new reality and leaders can paint the vision and picture about the benefits of the new reality and the purpose and why we're here and anchor to that to try to raise positivity. But once I learned about that transition framework, going through any subsequent changes myself became a lot easier to grasp and it really kind of makes changes in any part of your life. I mean, his book is not written about software development or product development.

(00:14:00):
Sometimes we're going to have a say, we're going to be able to participate, sometimes we're not. And being clear on who the decision maker is in a change is really important.

(00:14:11):
There's another framework that I really like. I don't think it's in my book, but I've written about it in my new book, but it's called RIDE. And we had a chief people officer at Procore and she's now at UKG, Pat Wadors. She taught us the RIDE framework for decision making clarity and it's who's requesting the change, who can give input to the change, who's the decider on the change, and who's going to execute on the change? So it's like R-I-D-E. And I googled this for a while; I couldn't find anything on it. I encouraged her to write about it and I credit her to that, Pat Wadors. She's awesome.

(00:14:53):
So a lot of the times it's like, what's the problem you're going to solve? You have a current state and a future state and that future state might be up to discussion, but maybe it's not depending on what it is. You're getting acquired, you're probably not going to have a standup meeting and talk about should we get acquired or not? No, you're not part of that decision. And then how's the change going to get rolled out or how are we going to do it?

(00:15:22):
In other cases at the team level, maybe you have a retrospective and you determine, "Hey, I think we'd be a bit more effective and we'd be able to deliver at a better cadence if we were two teams instead of one team." And if teams have the ability to talk about that and impact and have some agency into how their part of the org evolves and change, I think that could be really cool. I think that could be really empowering. I think that could help us feel more ownership in that company that we're in. It doesn't always have to be like decision making equals hierarchy or the person at the top. It doesn't have to be like that.

(00:16:01):
But again, reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with, oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. It's not. But anyway, we need to focus there. We got to focus on this people layer because reteaming is inevitable. We might as well get better at it because we're going to have to deal with it. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer. So let's focus there too.

Lenny (00:16:37):
On this transparent collaborative reteaming, final question here is just would you recommend time boxing this so that it doesn't suck up everyone's brain power for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it very dependent?

Heidi Helfand (00:16:48):
Yeah, you got to time box it.

Lenny (00:16:52):
Okay. Is there advice you have on how long?

Heidi Helfand (00:16:53):
Make a schedule biased towards shorter as opposed to longer. You don't want to deliberate on this forever, because especially as you include more people, it can be distracting. So you want to proceed as expediently as you can.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Okay, let's talk about the types of reteaming. This is kind of the core of your book and we haven't even gotten there yet. So you've identified there's five ways teams change. Can you just walk through them, help people understand what they are. And then also, we use this term reorg a lot in this conversation. I think that's the way most people think about change. After we go through this list, what does reorg refer to when it's maybe from the perspective of these five ways of teams changing?

Heidi Helfand (00:17:32):
Sure. Okay, so the five patterns of reteaming. One by one, someone joins your company or someone leaves your company, grow and split. It's a growth pattern. Teams grow bigger and then they split into two or more teams. Opposite of grow and split is merging. Sometimes two or more teams merge together. It's more of a shrinking pattern. We might be seeing more of this these days as companies downsize. Things merge together and consolidate. Isolation is, or innovation by isolation. Start a new team off to the side, a beneficial silo, give that team process freedom, great for catalyzing new product lines within your existing company. Also great for emergencies and they just happen anyway if we have incidents and people have to come together, solve an incident and then go back to their teams. And switching. So switching is moving from one team to another team. You can do this at a variety of cadences, short term, long term.

(00:18:36):
And then difference between a reteaming and a reorg. I think reorg is a word that has very traditional baggage and connotations. And when I was writing Dynamic Reteaming, it just didn't feel like an appropriate word to use for, well, Sue is looking to learn a little bit about how our web operations work, she's going to move to that team. It didn't feel appropriate to call that a reorg because Sue's moving and switching from one team to the next. I think reorg again... Reorganization is a traditional word. It implies on the large, it implies top-down changes that you have say no. It's something different than what I consider reteaming, which is these five patterns that happen at different levels.

Lenny (00:19:30):
Awesome. So let me just repeat back these five. So one by one, basically people joining your team, leaving your team, something very natural. People do all the time.

Heidi Helfand (00:19:37):
Your company.

Lenny (00:19:39):
Or your company, yeah. Growing, splitting a team gets really large and then it's like, okay, let's just split this into two, focus them on specific things instead of this one team trying to cover too much. Merging teams, the opposite of that. Isolation. I want to chat about that one a little more where you just have a team off to the side and they're just dedicated to something that you find really important. So with isolation, you have this awesome story of your time at a company called Expertcity, which turned into something people know most likely and ended up being a great outcome because of this reteaming into an isolation team. Could you talk about that?

Heidi Helfand (00:20:14):
Yeah, so I've been at different startups that have grown bigger and one of them, I was the 15th employee. I started as a web editor and became an interaction designer. And we were going to change the world and it was very exciting. We were in Santa Barbara, California. So the company's called Expertcity. And we were working on our first product, which was a marketplace for tech support. So imagine you have a problem on your computer, you can go to our website and then you can select an expert to see and control your screen to help you solve your tech support challenge. And so we had the screen sharing technology that we were inventing in the company. We had the web-based software to manage the interaction between the customer and the expert. We had the experts. We had in-house experts and then the vision was global worldwide experts. You were going to be like this marketplace, this eBay of services is what we talked about in the early days. I was really into this.

(00:21:17):
This was my first job in tech and I became an interaction designer working on kind of front-end UI flows with engineers. It's actually before the word interaction designer, my title was navigation designer. We made this up. So I was very into... It was before the words like UX and other things. People were talking about information architecture and other sub-genres of design. And we had individual offices. I had all the interaction flows on my walls. I was really into the words and one day I was in there and we were working on a new flow. We had all these hopes and dreams for this product and the CEO came into my office and he said, "Heidi, stop working on the marketplace. We're not going to do that product anymore. We're killing it because nobody's buying it and made six bucks or something last month." And he said, "Go to the beach." We were by Santa Barbara. I'm like, "What do you mean go to the beach?" He's like, "Well, I don't want you to start any work that you're going to have to maintain later as we figure out our next step." And I was like, "Okay."

(00:22:29):
I remember that day and I'm looking around my office and all these flows on the walls. So really these were domains like domain-driven design. It was all these web domains and which user interactions were going to happen and all these hopes and dreams and it was the first time in my career where we were told not to work on something. It wasn't paused. Some people say, "Oh, we're going to pause this," and then they never get back to it. This thing was like [inaudible 00:22:59]. And I didn't get it. I just didn't get it. I cried, I acted out, I sent this email like, "How can we kill the marketplace? It must live." It was quite an experience.

(00:23:14):
But then, and I don't know what the timing was, I was invited to be on this team off to the side and there was market validation going on. Our founders and product and others became students of market validation, Four Steps to the Epiphany. So we had built this thing, we spent all this time on this marketplace, but nobody would buy it. And so it was like do or die. We had to shift. This was before lean startup. So Four Steps to the Epiphany was the book, it was the manual, it was guiding the way. And so there were people that had a ton of conversations with potential customers about this new thing that we were going to build.

(00:23:58):
And so I was invited to be at this team off to the side and there was a small team and we didn't have to do waterfall software development. We were freed from that. We were liberated from that. We got to work in other ways. And I remember working with an engineer and we were figuring out how to create a forgot password flow because none of these patterns existed back then and we got to do this stuff. We got to deploy more frequently and the product was called GoToMyPC where you could see and operate someone's computer from a distance. And that was essentially the pivot that I feel like saved the company. Later we went on, we got folded back into the teams and we built GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar as a technical project manager at that time. So taking a team off to the side, giving that team process freedom. They didn't want us distracted from the drag.

(00:24:58):
When you're working on an existing product line, you get this cadence and it can become a mature cadence. Maybe people work in two weeks or one week now, but when you're working on something new, you need faster iteration loops. And our founders knew that need. So it was a privilege and I was delighted to be part of this other team and it was really, really exciting. So then looking back over the years, I was like, yeah, isolated teams, beneficial silos. Again, it's going against green of what some of these books say, oh, you want to desilo everything? No, sometimes there's a reason why you have a problem. You want to solve the problem. This was like, I mean, was this company going to go under? I didn't think of those kind of things at the time because I was just super into the work and very passionate and motivated about what we were building. But yeah, isolation pattern came up and we used it at another startup as well ever since.

(00:25:59):
So yeah, that's the story of Expertcity and from my perspective. Ask different people at different vantage points, but that... If we would've stayed within our teams and we would've had to develop with pixel-perfect mockups done in Photoshop like, "Here you go," I don't think we would've been fast enough. That was not good for the innovation that we needed. So it's also like innovation by isolation. It's good for emergencies. I was at another startup, we had performance issues with our first product. People left teams, brought a consultant in, went into a conference room for a couple of weeks, figured out some major changes that needed to happen, solve them, went back to the teams. This is not a new concept. The Chicken McNugget was saved by an isolated team, SWAT team.

(00:26:57):
There's a book called Teamwork. It's an old book from, I think the '70s, I have in my bookshelf here, and there's a story of the Chicken McNugget that you can read about where they brought in a consultant and had a very small team who worked in a different... They didn't work in their same plant where they were developing the product. They worked in a different plant. They reported straight up to one of the executives at McDonald's. And yeah, the Chicken McNugget lived on because it was like having challenges in the test marketplace in Indianapolis. So we didn't make this up. It's just like some of these things are kind of like, "Oh, it's like a noticing," and then you're like, "Oh, that's pattern." So it's collection.

Lenny (00:27:39):
There's this idea of a startup within a big company. Everyone's like, "Oh, it's just like the startup within a big company. We have all the resources that we need. There's no less risk, but we can innovate and try new things." Rarely does it feel like it work out. You're sharing stories where it does. Is there anything you found or any advice for how to actually be successful in this idea of having a team off to the side doing something innovative and different?

Heidi Helfand (00:28:00):
At AppFolio we did this. So there's a company called SecureDocs; it branched off into its own company and it was just acquired, I believe in 2022. When SecureDocs was happening, I was not on that team. I was on the other teams and I was watching, and again, same pattern. A team was created off to the side and they were given process freedom. They worked in more of a daily sprint style as opposed to the two-week sprint style that our other teams were doing at the time at early AppFolio. And so, one, isolate the team or put them in a different area. We could still see them. We were in this big open room, but it was their team area. I mean we had these impermanent walls between some of the teams. It was their region and they claimed it and they named themselves.

(00:28:58):
And so, one, separate location. There's another story in the book about a team that incubated a product idea within Citrix and they were in a garage of all places, so they were really isolated. But just put the team in a different region, make it that area. That's number one.

(00:29:17):
Number two, tell other people not to disturb this team. That's key. And hearing it from a leader is really, really important. No, you're not going to pull them into something else. They're working on this other thing. So people need to shed their skin of the other things that they're working on. If you take a bigger picture, kind of forest through the trees picture, you want people pairing and switching pairs so they're not single owners of the system. So when they have an opportunity to do something that could be really important to the company beyond one of these isolated teams, they can fade out and not be the only owner that has to transfer knowledge and then field questions for two years on how that system works. You want to build this redundancy in your teams. So that's like if you really want to plan ahead, do that first. Have that as part of how you operate, building this team redundancy and switching, because then it frees people to not be the only owner of a system and chained to a system.

(00:30:15):
And so isolate them. Tell people not to bother them. Do pairing and have shared ownership so it's easier for somebody to switch into something like this. Process freedom. Again, they can do things differently. Ideally they report up to someone that really has decision-making authority and decisions won't get reversed. Or they have to go through some complex web of like, "Is it okay if we do this?" No, you need a clear decision-making structure. They saw that at the McDonald's case study as well, which is not in my book, but it's in [inaudible 00:30:52] book called Teamwork.

(00:30:53):
And then that group, having that senior leader that they report into, getting the clear lines of communication there is also really important. So not having this heavyweight bureaucracy of, I don't know, quarterly business updates where everybody's making a slide deck for two years before they go to that meeting, trying to relieve the team of things like that and make it lighter.

(00:31:25):
And some of these teams, like SecureDocs became another product at AppFolio that was very, very successful. At one point, I think it was before we went public, it branched off into its own separate entity. I think maybe they shared a board member or something. I don't know how that worked, but it became its own entity. SecureDocs became separate and then it grew from there. And then it became this wonderful successful product that was recently acquired. People come and go at companies and companies grow and change and morph, and that was one case of departures that it's like bitter, sweet. You're happy for your friends and colleagues say, "Oh, he's going to be a CTO. He's going to be the CTO."

(00:32:14):
There's this entity. I remember visiting their office in Santa Barbara. It's great to see your friends succeed and thrive. And we developed other companies in that way.

Lenny (00:32:28):
Awesome. I think it's really nice to hear there's many success stories of this idea of a mini little startup within a company, and these are really good tips.

(00:32:37):

(00:33:27):
I feel like to me one of the most important ones you've talked to. And this is having an executive essentially sponsoring this team and supporting and protecting it versus some managers just like, now we're going to go do this off to the side, because otherwise no one's going to really take that seriously.

Heidi Helfand (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that's really, really important. I'll also say that things don't always succeed a hundred percent. I've seen isolated teams within companies where someone has the opportunity to sell something, they talk to their friends who are the engineers who build the feature for them, but then it leaves something for other people to maintain later and they weren't involved in the decisions. And it can be a big mess for all of these patterns there. It's like kind of like balconies and basements. You can screw it up too. It's not all stuff is hard. That's why I like to lean into it and I've written about it. Things take effort. The tree is going to drop the leaves and you got to sweep them up. Everything takes work and effort.

Lenny (00:34:33):
We've talked about the isolation pattern. I thought it'd be good to talk through the rest of the patterns real quick and share maybe one or two tips for how to be successful or make it work well or better.

Heidi Helfand (00:34:45):
Sure.

Lenny (00:34:46):
Before you start, actually, I think I missed a nuance and you corrected me, but I think I missed it, which is for the one-on-one pattern, it's actually describing joining the company specifically not joining a team. Is that right?

Heidi Helfand (00:34:56):
Yeah. And in the book it might be a little blurred because this is like some of the... Switching and one by one sound very similar, and they do have some Venn diagram overlaps, but I'll distinguish them as I talk about them.

Lenny (00:35:11):
Cool.

Heidi Helfand (00:35:12):
So one by one, someone joins your company or they leave your company. So the tip with one by one is when someone joins, help them feel a sense of belonging, and you can do that through not having their first day be them sitting over there alone. You could have someone have a first pair. There's a chapter in my book about onboarding. This is in the space of onboarding. Also with one by one, when people join, you also need to pay attention to the people who are already there and it's good for them to know when someone is joining the company; that it shouldn't be a surprise. So visualizing the hiring and the opportunities is something that I think is a really good idea. It could be challenging for someone if somebody joins and they become their manager, but what if that person wanted to be the manager and then they brought in someone from the outside to become the manager?

(00:36:08):
So you need to pay attention to the new hires that are joining, help them feel a sense of belonging, get them to talk about themselves, which is said to increase their sense of connection and retention. There's some research in the book The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle, which talks about that. But then it's also important to coach the people through change that are already at the company, especially if they weren't involved in the particular decision, bringing on this new leader that comes in and brings in all their people. So you got to pay attention to different people.

(00:36:45):
Grow and split is a natural thing that happens when you're like startup scale up and growing bigger and bigger. The first team probably grows bigger and then splits into two or three. So when the team gets bigger, facilitation and communication tends to break down. So some signals that teams might bring up when they feel like a change might be helpful is the meetings are taking longer. You're in that case where it's harder to make decisions. It was easier when there were like five of us, but now they're 13. The work becomes divergent. They're working on this one thing, they're working on something else. No one's paying attention in the standup so much anymore because this work has diverged. And those are a few of the signals. And then someone typically brings it up. If you normalize the idea that it's okay for teams to have input into their future structures, maybe they'll bring it up and decide that, "Hey, it might be better if we split."

(00:37:52):
Sometimes splitting though can create dependencies that weren't there when you were together as one team. So you inherit other problems or you might inherit challenges like, all right, the team decides it's far effective if they split into two or three, but we just have one product manager, we just have one designer. We just have one person who helps us anticipate quality challenges. So it's a lot of problem trading when you do a lot of this stuff. Like anything, you have a challenge, how might we solve it? Well, there's option A, option B and option C. So that's grow and split and it's very common I think when your company is growing and changing, kind of like that.

(00:38:37):
Merging is the opposite of grow and split. Two or more teams combine together. Or at a higher level, a company acquires another company and then there's a merging that happens. So merging I think is related to when companies downsize or shrink, things consolidate, come together, or again, when at the company level companies combine, one acquires another, gets acquired. How that goes down varies, but there's this concept called panarchy that I write about in my book that a lot of these changes is changes at the individual level, the team level, the team of teams level, department level, the company level. So yeah, merging. So there's a business decision that the companies merge together and then changes might ensue.

(00:39:28):
So maybe the company wants to get ahead on building and having another vertical in their SaaS company. We acquired a company at AppFolio to bring us faster into workflow software for law firms. So we acquired a company based in San Diego, and that got us a couple of years ahead. I remember one of the leaders saying that. So again, we weren't involved... I wasn't involved in this decision as an IC at the time. So it could be a business decision for merging at that level. It could be that people leave, there are departures and teams and responsibilities consolidate together. That's merging. So it could be that kind of shrinking that we're seeing. It could be that the company is having one leader instead of three and there's a consolidation and the teams kind of merge together. So it's the opposite of grow and split.

(00:40:23):
One activity I do like to do with teams that merge is called story of our team. That's in chapter 13 of the second edition. So with story of our team, each team makes a timeline of... They stand in order of when they joined their team and they make a timeline with milestones of when they joined their team, when people left, and significant events and things they created that they're excited about and that they're proud of. And that they branch together with their newly merged team, and then it's good to get a shared sense of history. So you have these teams or companies that come together, they make shared timelines, they share their milestones and things that they built that they're proud of. They tell each other about it and then they have a sense of like, "Wow, we didn't know that. Oh, I didn't know that you had built a system like that. We did too." Or, "We've never built anything like that. That is so cool. What did you learn from that?" We get to learn about each other and then we're together. We're like, "All right, we're this merged entity now. What's next?" Looking out to the future so we have the same shared vision. So I love doing that. There's different tactics you can do before, during, and after each of these patterns. Yeah, that's merging.

(00:41:46):
Isolation we talked about before. Put the team up to the side, give them process freedom, have them report up to a decision maker, tell the other teams not to bother them. Let them work at the cadence that they want to work at. That makes it easier. If you are doing a short-term thing, you got to work it out with the larger entity so you don't create something in isolation that other people have to maintain. There's ways that this can be messed up.

(00:42:15):
And then switching. Switching pattern is really tied to learning and development and fulfillment. It could be that you want to work with other people. Like forming, storming, norming, performing, Tuckman's model, he forgot the phase called stagnating. Sometimes it feels like we're in a team for too long. We're tired of working with these people. We want a little variety. We want to work with that person over there. Or maybe we want to work on a new system. We don't have the opportunity to do that in our current team, but what if we could work on that system over there with those people? It could totally refresh us. It could be like having a new job within our same company. It could extend the lifespan of the amazing employee in your company. So switching is tied to that kind of fulfillment, which is one of the reasons why I made it separate from one by one and tied that to the company.

(00:43:11):
The other thing with switching is that you could create safety nets in your company through switching. I just wrote a newsletter post about this yesterday because maybe we're going to have some more changes this year. Maybe companies are going to be hiring less. I don't like the thought of companies downsizing or having layoffs or anything like that, but I think to myself, well, have multiple owners of a system. So not only one person is that tower of knowledge that owns that one system. There's some stories in my book where I interviewed Richard Sheridan, who is the chief storyteller and co-founder of a wonderful company called Menlo Innovations in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They built their company Menlo to have people work in pairs. Not just the software engineers; team members work in pairs and they switch pairs at a regular cadence. And you know that when you're joining the company because you're involved in some kind of pairing. So there's parity from when you're interviewing to when you're at the company.

(00:44:14):
But switching also helps build that knowledge redundancy in your company. A little more about tolerance. So if someone leaves, they don't leave with all the information in their head. We had that. At that first startup Expertcity, we had some single owners of systems and when they left, it just becomes a challenge and a setback. And at AppFolio we shared a founder between the first startup and the second startup. Many of their early engineers from that first startup went to the second startup.

(00:44:50):
I was 10th at AppFolio. I was 15th at Expertcity. So we wanted to work together. So it was that global idea of switching one by one or similar. But anyway, at the second startup we had the chance to do things differently. So we had pairing and switching pairs and test-driven development. We had help to do that, but this kind of redundancy built safety into our systems, especially when AppFolio is processing a lot of rent payments. There's a lot of money. There's ACH going through. Those are critical systems and it's very important that things are safe and secure. You don't want to haphazardly switch people around. You can screw this up, again, that balconies and basements concept. You don't want somebody over here, they will switch every two weeks and have no say in their team. There's ways to screw all of this up, but there's other ways to do it well.

(00:45:48):
I remember when we were at our first team at AppFolio and we did a grow and split. It grew and it split into two or three teams. I remember there was a loss for some of the engineers who wanted to pair program with some of the other engineers, and they started a regular rotation themselves from one team to the next, and that brought fulfillment. It brought joy. I mean they would see each other in the workspace every day, but they wanted to work together. It brought them learning joy and fulfillment, and I love that. For those who are like keep the team stable and the same forever, I'm like, "Well, what about that?" It brings me satisfaction and joy when I see my colleagues. It's like autonomy, mastery, purpose, like Dan Pink's book Drive, when people are really given some agency and the opportunity to work a little bit differently than maybe that traditional boxed version you might see on my bookshelf. You can really create not only products that people love, but companies that people love and want to be at.

Lenny (00:47:03):
All these stories of team changes and reorg, it made me think about a quote that one of my managers always used to say about reorging and changing teams is that there's no perfect org structure. There's only the best idea you have at the time for what the org could be. And then there's the issues with that org that you identify as you're putting in place and then set up processes and systems around to try to catch that dependencies, as you said, or overlap of ownership. Is there anything along those lines that comes up of just things you found of just like, there's never going to be the perfect way to do it. This is just our best idea at the time and here's how we deal with the downsides of this approach?

Heidi Helfand (00:47:41):
Yeah, I think there's a lot of wisdom to what your manager said and your colleague there because yeah, I mean as time goes on, conditions change. We evolve and change. We're subject to different influences. COVID happens. We weren't dealing with that 10 years ago. We grow and adapt and morph. We try to get together and make the best decisions that we can when we're faced with challenges, and a lot of it is problem trading. We have this challenge today. We decide, oh, there's a few ways we could handle this. Pros and cons of each solution. It's like the Toyota Kata, like grasp the current condition. You'll experience you have challenges. What's the next evolution or the next target condition? How might you get there? And then you're there and you're like, okay, grasp the current target condition. What's it like? What are you experiencing? Oh, we might try this. We're always transforming from the current state to the future state.

(00:48:54):
So to that, I would ask people, well, how do you want that to be? And how do you want to show up and be as a leader? You want to just be like, "All right, I've got to get this done. The reorg is done by an email and we're just sending it out, or this small team change. And here it is; it's done. Goodbye." Or is it a little bit where you get people's input? And that in itself, you got to weigh what you're dealing with, again. But I like to think about that. What kind of leader do you want to be? Leaders need patience. It's hard to be a leader. It's challenging, but what kind of an environment or vibe do you want to cultivate in your teams and what do you want the people to be like?

(00:49:42):
I have a degree in teaching English and applied linguistics, and I remember studying Paulo Freire and other educational problem-posing methods of education. We have these teams that solve these complex problems and challenges and build these really cool things for customers. Let's involve them in some of the org decisions that are going to be part of their daily life. Really, you like that idea. Again, it's not perfect. You can't involve people on everything, especially if they're wide-scale changes that you just can't.

Lenny (00:50:19):
Along these lines of doing things badly sometimes, you have this whole section on anti-patterns of reteaming. I think there's about five of them. I don't know if you have these all top of mind, but if you do, I'd love to hear some anti-patterns.

Heidi Helfand (00:50:34):
Yeah. Well, one of them is people always think that reteaming is, you have a pool of people and you're assigning them to a bunch of different projects like, "Okay, you'll work 10% on this one, 5% on this one, 20% on this one. We are going to allocate the resources from our component-based teams into these different projects." We did that in Waterfall like many years ago, but that doesn't really work. A lot of the times the percentages don't add up. It's very hard for people to multitask and be involved in multiple efforts at once. It's hard for the brain with all the context switching that needs to happen in that case. So I call that the percentage anti-pattern.

(00:51:15):
There's also, I probably wrote about it like, poof, they're gone or suddenly they're here. Reteaming or having people suddenly show up and you weren't expecting them or suddenly they're gone and there's no communication around it whatsoever, that's another anti-pattern.

Lenny (00:51:32):
One of the ones I love is this idea of spreading high performers. This idea of we're going to spread the high performers across other teams.

Heidi Helfand (00:51:38):
That's an AppFolio story. Jon Walker was telling me back in the day that... I mean, he did this experiment. He had this thought that many of... There's one team that was like, I guess they were delivering at this cadence that they loved and they were building this stuff and there's this energy and you can almost feel it. Like let's just spread the people from that team across the other ones and then we'll have that. And it didn't work. He didn't have that. It didn't happen. And that was a visceral learning for him that it doesn't essentially work. And people are like, what does it take to be a high performing team? What does it take to have that magical team experience where there's that chemistry and the people are together? And there's stories in the book. Damon Valenzona was telling me one about how it's like's a band and we're with off each other. We're creating this music together. So John felt like he essentially destroyed that when he split up that team. So that's the story that inspired that anti-pattern.

Lenny (00:52:49):
The reason people are worried about reteams and reorgs is this... A lot of times it's exact reason that you just shared, which is our team is amazing. I don't want it to change. I don't want to split. I don't want to add anyone. I don't want to remove anyone. I guess is there anything else along those lines to help people feel better about, no, this is actually going to be okay and/or it's inevitable. It's not going to last.

Heidi Helfand (00:53:13):
I think sometimes you have that awesome team situation. It's an enjoyable experience. People are learning. You're looking forward to it every day. You're delivering the stuff that people love. You're telling people what's going on. You have that matched expectation where people aren't breathing down your neck because it's late or something. Sometimes you want to keep that team together. You don't want to destroy that dynamic. But the thing is, maybe that's a small startup that grows and you need to grow because you have a bigger vision and it needs to be more than these 10 people. And so there is sometimes this feeling of loss, like, "This is our company. This is my experience at this company of 10 people, but suddenly we're 20 people. It doesn't feel the same like it did anymore and it feels different."

(00:54:05):
And people, they always ask the question, "How do we maintain our culture? It feels different than it was before." The thing is, it is different, and our companies go through stages. The company of today is not the company it was a year ago. The people turn over and change, what we work on turns over and change. The whole world and industry and global events change and put different pressures on us, and we got to live in this global context. So nothing lasts. Sometimes I have a picture of myself holding an ice cream cone that's melting. Not to be a total downer, but appreciate it when you're on a team and you love it and it's amazing because these are our lives and we have to have gratitude and appreciate what we have because naturally things evolve and change. It's just inevitable. So we appreciate what we have.

(00:55:07):
A lot of us can look back on our careers and remember those times when we were, in my case, skipping through the halls because I was so happy. And I was like I couldn't even tell you. Well, why was I skipping through the halls at that moment? What was it? Well, it was the people and the conditions and what we were doing and the time, the era almost because yeah, it does change.

(00:55:30):
There's a book by Ichak Adizes called Managing Corporate Lifecycles. It's one that many of us read for years at AppFolio, maybe the previous company as well. The Adizes Institute influenced some of our leaders and they influenced us with this. And it talks about the different stages of companies from birth. There's go-go stage, maturity, death of companies. These are like lifecycles. The company grows and changes and morphs and changes. The people in the teams do that as well. I have an ecocycle in my book where I talk about that kind of aging and changing. Then there's a disruption and you have a new beginning. We're part of these stories that are in progress. This is not an unchanging, unmoving entity that we work in. So just be kind to each other, enjoy your experiences and learn as much as you can.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It reminds me of advice Sheryl Sandberg shared when she came to the Airbnb offices. Someone asked her: "What advice do you have to deal with all this constant change?" Like the quote I shared at the top of the episode of every six months, there's a massive reorg. Our culture's changing. Teams keep changing. It's constant flux. What is your advice to deal with that? And her advice was: That is good. The fact that you're growing so fast and having to change is the best case scenario because the alternative is you are not growing and it's much harder and much more painful because the changes are much harder. People get let go. Your business may go away. So her advice is just, this is good. Change means things are... And growth leads to change, especially hypergrowth, and that you should appreciate this time versus be afraid of it and think that it's a negative.

Heidi Helfand (00:57:23):
And it seems like she had such a wide vantage point and could see the forest through the trees of the fact that, well, this company's doing well and this is why we're growing and changing. And I remember one of my leaders, CTO Jon Walker, AppFolio, he told me that once too. He was like... I'd be having a problem or something and I'd come to him and he'd always say to me, "It's always great to be at a successful company, Heidi." And it's like, well, yeah, sometimes you don't think about the finances when you're in your day to day and you have a problem with another person or they come to you and they have a problem with this other person. But in the grand scheme of it, how is the company doing? It's really a critical vantage point that we need to remind ourselves of. But yeah, I wouldn't say all change is always good. Your mileage may vary there, but the general idea that the company is doing well, you're growing and changing, you're trying to make things happen, I think is definitely the space I'd rather be in than the opposite.

Lenny (00:58:31):
And I think it's especially true for people that haven't worked at a company that didn't work out where they think this sucks when really this is pretty good compared to all the things that could be happening.

Heidi Helfand (00:58:42):
Yeah, yeah, definitely. So we coach and help each other as we go along.

Lenny (00:58:48):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Used to work with John Cutler, who was a previous guest on this podcast, and he had a question that he wanted me to ask you. He said that, "Heidi is one of the best listeners I've ever worked with." And so the question is, what's your secret to being a good listener?

Heidi Helfand (00:59:07):
Well, listening is a muscle to build and to always work on. You got to put your attention out. Focus on the other person. Sometimes if I'm looking down, maybe I reconnect and look at them. You got to read body language and other things. I'm trained as a co-active coach, which involves different levels of listening. So you have level one, which is internal listening. Like if you and I are talking, but I'm thinking about what am I going to have for lunch? I'm in level one. I've got to redirect it out to you and focus on you. So when I focus on you is I'm in level two listening. I'm putting my attention out and I'm really anchoring towards you. It's a coaching skill.

(00:59:47):
And then level three is global listening, environmental listening. If a marching band suddenly walked behind you, I'm going to point that out because it's in my field. I'm not going to ignore that. I'm going to bring that up. So we pay attention to the vibe and the feel in the room and where we're at. But then also if you're talking about something and suddenly you go like this or you have this kind of sudden pain in your neck when you're talking about this one thing, I might notice that you're doing this and touching your neck because that's information. That's a kind of listening, and so I might ask you about that. Or if the face turns red or you look down or away, it's another kind of listening. So Co-Active Training Institute, coactive.com is my co-active coaching training, so I learned it from them, Henry Kimsey-House and-

Lenny (01:00:48):
Wow, that is an awesome answer. There's a lot of depth there. So coactive.com, I'm going to check that out. So you actually got trained in this skill. Okay, that's great. That'll make people feel better. They're like, okay, amazing. I'm going to check this out. I'm going to try to be a better listener through the rest of this podcast episode from these tips.

Heidi Helfand (01:01:08):
I will say that sometimes I'm not a good listener though.

Lenny (01:01:13):
Yeah, so it goes. Heidi, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:22):
I don't think so. I really appreciate your questions and talking with you.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:34):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:39):
Leading Intelligent Teams is one, Liberating Structures is another one, and of course, Transitions by William Bridges. I also like the Leader's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making.

Lenny (01:01:53):
Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:57):
I did like The Bear, the cooking-related show, the restaurant-related show, and gets into the hospitality industry. I really like that. Movies, there isn't really one that stands out. I always look forward to being on an airplane to see what movies are playing, but no movie for you.

Lenny (01:02:21):
What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you are interviewing?

Heidi Helfand (01:02:27):
I always like to ask people, "Well, why do you want to join our company? What is it about working with us that would be exciting for you? Why our company as opposed to another one?"

Lenny (01:02:39):
What do you look for in their answer that is a good sign?

Heidi Helfand (01:02:43):
They have some knowledge about what we do, what we build. Maybe they bring up that they've noticed something on one of the websites or a product launch that we just announced, just that maybe it's part of their story in their career. They're going in this direction, and they heard about us and they thought, "Wow, I would love to work on that."

Lenny (01:03:08):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Heidi Helfand (01:03:11):
I'm very into vintage clothing and specifically real wool cashmere, not synthetic blends. I also like vintage blazers. A lot of the times where I'm giving a talk, I'm wearing a vintage blazer. I really like the clothing and design, and I kind of really, really love unusual vintage pieces that I could find, but they do need to... A lot of the fast fashion that's out there today is a lot of these blends with these materials that you've never heard of, but there's something special about vintage cashmere, for example.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Do you have a source for some good stuff? Is it like eBay? Is it stores locally? Is there a site? Is there somewhere you're finding some good stuff?

Heidi Helfand (01:04:03):
I travel around the world and I give talks on reteaming. I do workshops. And usually I go to vintage and antique stores. I was just in Berlin. I was doing that. I was doing it in London. And yeah, I love thrifting, Salvation Army, Goodwill, any of these places that we have in many of the US cities, the Humana line of stores that I've been to in Europe and other places. I try to find the small, unusual antique places as well. My aunt's an antique dealer in Michigan, and she doesn't specialize in vintage clothing, but I just love that idea of discovering unique and unusual things that maybe they remind you of times in the past. Maybe you find that, "Oh my gosh, we had that mug back in the '80s or whatever, or in the '90s." Things can kind of remind people of other times. So I like that. I think there's information stored in unique items.

Lenny (01:05:12):
Beautiful. I bet Berlin has some really cool vintage stuff, really wacky stuff.

Heidi Helfand (01:05:16):
Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting places to explore, and I think it's just so much more interesting than some of the brand new kind of stuff.

Lenny (01:05:30):
Agreed. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to or sharing with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Heidi Helfand (01:05:41):
I like asking people how can you be kind to yourself?

Lenny (01:05:47):
Say more.

Heidi Helfand (01:05:48):
I ask myself that too. I used to run a lot in Santa Barbara at Ellwood, which is a beautiful trail that you can go down to the ocean, you come back up. It's like More Mesa in Santa Barbara, and I would run and then I'd be like, "God, this is so hard." And then I would walk for a little while and I'd think to myself, "Well, how can I be kind to myself? I mean, what am I doing here? Does it have to be fast? No. I am here to decompress and enjoy, so how can I be kind to myself?" I think sometimes I get hard on myself or have very high expectations kind of achiever mentality, and I've learned through the years that it's okay to slow down. It's okay to not go, go, go the whole time. So I would ask other people that as well, especially if they're going through a challenge or burning midnight oil or whatever. It's like, "What about self-care? How can you be kind to yourself?"

Lenny (01:06:56):
Beautiful. Final question. I was scouring your LinkedIn and I saw a quote from the CTO of AppFolio in his endorsement of you. Said that you were the unofficial director of fun at AppFolio. Is there a story that comes to mind of something that you did at AppFolio that created a lot of joy and fun for the team?

Heidi Helfand (01:07:15):
We had these hack days, and I think they do that to this day. So twice a year we'd bring people together and we copied and learned from Atlassian. I remember we had calls with some coaches from Atlassian for how did they do their ShipIt Day, or they originally called it FedEx Day, changed it to ShipIt Day. We followed their model and we'd had this two o'clock on Thursday at two o'clock on Friday where we'd build whatever we wanted and we'd have a theme, and then we'd have goofy prizes at the end that were like traveling trophies. One of them was like a clickety-clack keyboard that we spray-painted gold by the railroad tracks, but people could work on anything. There were teams that formed... We did it with a self-selection marketplace. People formed their topics and teams, and one team hid geocaches throughout Santa Barbara. They're there to this day because we registered them with the Geocaching website. Another team built a vintage video game machine, and it was in the dev room. Another one they catapulted. They built this... Is it a trebuchet?

Lenny (01:07:16):
Yeah.

Heidi Helfand (01:08:27):
That catapult this fruit in the parking lot. I don't know how we got away with that, but we were in the early days. We did a lot of fun stuff like that, and you could work with different people, build these larger relationships, which later makes it easier for reteaming, because then later if you reteam, you're not strangers with people, so you want to cultivate the community. So we had this department of fun. We would plan the fun in a variety of other ways as well.

Lenny (01:08:56):
So fun. Heidi, you're awesome. I think we've helped a lot of people feel better about the endless change that they're probably going through right now. Two final questions. Where can folks find your book, find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Heidi Helfand (01:09:10):
You can go to heidihelfand.com or Google my name and I come up. Heidi@dynamicreteaming.com, heidi.helfand@gmail.com you can find me. I'm out there. And yeah, I love to work with companies and teams going through change, and I do that in a variety of ways. Teach workshops, do talks. So if any of this is interesting, reach out.

Lenny (01:09:33):
And then do you also consult and work with individual companies or not?

Heidi Helfand (01:09:37):
I do. Yeah. I do that now. I like to work on a retainer basis or I'll even join a team, so looking for the-

Lenny (01:09:37):
All right.

Heidi Helfand (01:09:45):
... next one.

Lenny (01:09:47):
Amazing. And we'll link to all this stuff in the show notes. Heidi, thank you again so much for being here.

Heidi Helfand (01:09:53):

# How to build a team that can “take a punch” | Hilary Gridley (Head of Core Product, Whoop)

## Transcript

Hilary Gridley (00:00:00):
Product leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):
You spend a lot of time thinking about how to help your team learn to take a punch.

Hilary Gridley (00:00:10):
If they come to me and they're upset, I try to focus them less around how you litigate another person's impression of you and more on what is the action that you can take to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you. What are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
You have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship.

Hilary Gridley (00:00:31):
I would really love it if more people were like, "Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail. It's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
Is there something you've learned about when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with?

Hilary Gridley (00:00:41):
People think that the game is all about influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them. You come up thinking like you're the protagonist. But in the story of work, you are probably not the protagonist. You're not special.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):
Today my guest is Hilary Gridley. Hilary is head of core product at Whoop. Previously, she was a senior director of product at Big Health and a senior product marketing manager at Dropbox. Even more importantly, she wrote what is now the sixth most popular post of all time in my newsletter, How to Become a Super Manager with AI. She's also the first ever cross over guest between this podcast and our sister podcast, How I AI with Claire Vo.

(00:01:17):
And not just that, her episode with Claire is on track to be the most popular episode of the podcast. So all that to say, Hilary is incredible and I'm so excited to continue learning from her. This conversation is packed with advice that will make you a better product leader, builder and also just a better human. If you know what's good for you, you don't want to miss this episode. A big thank you to Sam Propis, Danielle Reynold, and Kelvin Wong for sharing suggestions for this conversation.

(00:02:04):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.

(00:02:27):
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:02:50):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at WorkOS.com to learn more. That's WorkOS.com.

(00:03:22):
This episode is brought to you by Persona, the adaptable identity platform that helps businesses fight fraud, meet compliance requirements, and build trust. While you're listening to this right now, how do you know that you're really listening to me, Lenny? These days, it's easier than ever for fraudsters to steal PII, faces, and identities. That's where Persona comes in.

(00:03:44):
Persona helps leading companies like LinkedIn, Etsy, and Twilio securely verify individuals and businesses across the world. What sets Persona apart is its configurability. Every company has different needs depending on its industry use cases, risk tolerance, and user demographics. That's why Persona offers flexible building blocks that allow you to build tailored collection and verification flows that maximize conversion while minimizing risk.

(00:04:11):
Plus, Persona's orchestration tools automate your identity process so that you can fight rapidly shifting fraud and meet new waves of regulation. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise business, Persona has a plan for you. Learn more at withpersona.com/lenny. Again, that's with-P-E-R-S-O-N-A. com/lenny. Hilary, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Hilary Gridley (00:04:39):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
I talked to a bunch of people that I work with you about what we should talk about and what you're amazing at. First of all, every one of them loves working with you so much. One of them is like, "I joined Whoop just to work with Hilary and to report to her."

(00:04:53):
And of that, there's this theme that emerged that I think is a good overarching theme for our conversation, and it's something that you spend a lot of time thinking about, and it's how to help your team and how to help people within your company learn to take a punch. Essentially, how to help them deal with hard stuff and do hard stuff and build hard things. So I guess just broadly, does that ring a bell? Does that resonate?

Hilary Gridley (00:05:16):
Yeah, absolutely. It's something I care a lot about. I've been, I think, pretty lucky in my career. I've been very drawn to working on hard product problems, regulated areas, really hard business models, things with pretty high emotional stakes for the users of the products. You're really likely to run into a lot of setbacks along the way. And I think this is really relevant today because I look out and I talk to a lot of people and I hear fear and I hear uncertainty, and I think it comes from a few places.

(00:05:50):
I think obviously I'm really excited about AI and how it's transforming the way we work, and I think a lot of people are, but I think a lot of people are scared too. And they're embracing these tools, they're learning these tools, but a lot of them have a question in the back of their mind, what does this mean for the future of my job? And in many cases, what does this mean for my identity?

(00:06:10):
I think it makes people question even just how we provide value as humans in society. And I also think people, especially young people, today haven't even necessarily been in a career environment where there wasn't always a thread of layoffs or things like that. And I think that's taken a real psychic toll on a lot of people. And so I think all managers now really need to be able to lead their teams through uncertainty, through fear, through hard things.

(00:06:37):
And I love the concept of taking a punch. I've got a couple other tools that I like to use, but I think it can teach people how to thrive in these environments. And it's really important to me because I would love if more people took on hard things. I think there's so many really hard challenging problems out there to solve.

(00:06:54):
And the more people are fearful about the future of their careers or the future of work, I think the more they gravitate toward things that they feel like they're likely to succeed at. And I think that's wonderful. We need that too, but I would really love it if more people were like, "Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail and it's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):
There's so many Venn diagrams of why this skill is so important, especially today. One is it feels like the easy stuff is done. The stuff left to build is hard. It feels like hardware, deep tech is where things are heading. Also, just machine learning, AI skills, just stuff that's really hard. And then the other is just AI is just changing so much. It's just such a stressful time and hard time for a lot of people.

(00:07:40):
Let's actually walk through some of the things that you have learned about how to help people get good at these things, about how to help people learn to take a punch, AKA do hard things, deal with struggle. The first is you actually actively teach them. You have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship and to take a punch. So what are some of those things? What are some of the things that you teach your team and help them develop a skill?

Hilary Gridley (00:08:05):
So at its core, when I say take a punch, what I mean is you're going to run into situations where something has gone wrong. Maybe you have misstepped. Maybe you are just hearing someone speak critically about your work. Whatever it might be, you're going to feel like you have taken a punch.

(00:08:21):
It's a very physical feeling. And I think as managers, you spend a lot of time teaching your team how to be successful. You want to prepare them to maximize the chances of good outcome. But if you don't also prepare them for what happens when that outcome isn't as good, you're going to run into some problems.

(00:08:41):
And so when I think about how to take a punch, what I say to my team is if they come to me and they're upset because something has happened, maybe they said something in a meeting that wasn't received well, or again, they're hearing somebody else talk about them in some way, whatever it is, I try to focus them less around whatever happened and how you litigate another person's impression of you based on something that has already happened, and more on what is the action that you can take next to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you.

(00:09:15):
And I think the counter program piece is really important. Because whenever we feel our egos injured, I think it's very natural for all of us to say like, "Well, that's not fair. I want to correct the record." When you do that, I think more than often, more often than not, you come off as just looking defensive and you start obsessing over things that you don't actually have control over, which is what another person thinks of you. You don't even necessarily have that information.

(00:09:41):
And so I always ask myself in these moments, what is one thing that I can do, small, that will demonstrate the opposite of what I'm afraid this person thinks of me? And so I'll give you an example of this. I was in a meeting a while ago, and we were talking about different things that we wanted to start tracking in the Whoop Journal. And our chief technology officer suggested ketamine tracking.

(00:10:06):
And I thought she was making a joke and I laughed, and she looked at me very seriously and was like, "This isn't funny, Hilary. This is a serious issue for a lot of people, and it's an emerging problem in some cases. And I think we should take it seriously. I think there's a lot of value we could provide here." And I was completely humiliated. Humiliated because I actually take this stuff really seriously. I take addiction really seriously. I have a ton of empathy for people who struggle with it.

(00:10:36):
And I also think of myself as somebody who embraces new ideas and wants to be on the forefront and would never laugh off something that seems like a fringe issue that's I think becoming actually more and more a big part of what's happening today. And so I realized that in that moment I was having that reaction because of the feeling that it gave me about who I am as a person, and I became so worried that this other person had the wrong impression of me.

(00:11:06):
And I wanted to follow up with her after and say, "Let me explain myself. Let me explain why I didn't mean that," or whatever it is. But as I said, I think usually you're fighting a losing battle when you're trying to do that, and it draws attention to the thing that you did poorly. And you don't really want to draw more attention to it. You want to move on, take action, move forward. And so I thought about, well, what am I afraid that she thinks of me?

(00:11:32):
I'm afraid that she thinks that maybe I don't take some of these health issues seriously. I'm afraid she thinks that maybe I'm somebody who laughs off emerging trends. And so I thought about what's something that I could do to demonstrate the opposite of that?

(00:11:49):
And I did some research very, very quickly on what are some emerging public health concerns that people really aren't talking about that would be interesting to track? And I found some interesting research about sports betting, and especially young people in sports betting, and it's becoming this thing that a lot of public health experts are very worried about.

(00:12:08):
And so I very quickly just sent her a note that said, "Wanted to build on this idea you had today. I really liked that idea, by the way. I saw this article, I saw this research about this other emerging thing, sports betting, and I think it'd be really interesting for us to start tracking that because we could maybe draw some correlations between people stress. We have a stress monitor in Whoop. We can track their stress. We could draw interesting correlations between betting behaviors and stress levels."

(00:12:36):
And so that's all I did. It took me five, 10 minutes total. But I think it's a great example of showing this idea of counter-program that narrative, don't fight about the narrative. And so when I teach this to my team, I'm always doing the same thing. They come to me. They seem agitated about something and I say to them, "It seems like this is really bothering you. What's going on in your head? What are you afraid of? What are you worried about?" And often it will emerge, "I'm worried that this other person thinks I'm bad at my job. I'm worried that this person thinks I'm an idiot," whatever it is. And I challenge that. I think this is really important for managers too to challenge this negative thinking when you see it happen and not just validate it and allow them to go down these negative spirals.

(00:13:17):
I challenge it and I say, "First of all, I don't think there's evidence for that. Is there evidence for that? And even if there is, it doesn't really matter. What's something that you could do to show them that it's not true because you know it's not true?"

(00:13:31):
And I think giving people that power to focus on the next step they can take and the action that they can take that helps them feel more secure in their identity in who they are because their action demonstrates that, it just gets them out of that negative thinking and it gets them through that trough of despair that comes after you feel like you took a punch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:52):
So the idea here is when you're afraid somebody that matters in your career thinks ill of you, of something that you did, of you're not good at something or you think something that they're not happy about, this is a version of getting punched basically is you just feeling like someone thinks you're not doing a great job. And so the tactic here is how to change their mind almost about you and give you something tangible to do.

Hilary Gridley (00:14:16):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:17):
Okay. And so the question to ask, and I wrote this down as you were talking, is, and this is what you ask of your reports, what is the one thing that you can do that demonstrates the opposite of what you think this person thinks about you?

Hilary Gridley (00:14:32):
Exactly. This comes up all the time. There will be narratives that emerge, some are good, some are bad, about you and your career. And I think especially when people get to a place where they're putting themselves out there more, they're talking in more presentations, they're talking in more meetings, it's very natural for them to become concerned with the perception themselves.

(00:14:52):
And it is scary because it feels like something, as I said, you don't have control over. And so exactly. If instead of focusing people around what do these people think of me, you focus them around, well, what are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be, I think that can just be incredibly effective at giving people more of a sense of agency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:12):
I guess talk about the balance of I'm just going to prove everyone wrong against what they think versus here's who I am and I know this is me and this person is mistaken. And instead of debating them, I'm going to show them who I am. Just not overstressing about everyone thinking things about you in different ways.

Hilary Gridley (00:15:30):
There is some value I think in having a little bit of a chip on your shoulder. You see that people who are really successful, they do have a little bit of like, "I'm going to prove them wrong." And so I don't want to say that you shouldn't think about it at all or you shouldn't care. Of course, it's natural to care, and of course, it's fine to care, but I do want to just help my team build this habit of doing the things that you know to be right and having conviction in that.

(00:15:57):
Being open to learning along the way and calibrating as you go, but not becoming overly concerned with your fears of what other people are going to think of you. Because I think especially for otherwise really thoughtful, really the people who are hard on themselves, I think that that just holds them back from being the person that they can be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:21):
So a key part of this is, this is going to help you stop just spiraling on thinking about what they think about you and gives you something to do that will change that. And then the other key point here is don't try to convince them otherwise. You're not going to go to your manager like, "Oh, I really think ketamine therapy and addiction is really important, and I didn't mean to say it this way," and that kind of thing.

Hilary Gridley (00:16:45):
I'm not interested in litigating the things that happened already when we can move forward. And I'm certainly not interested in litigating what another person thinks about a thing that happened. I feel like I've spent so much time talking to people in meetings, whatever it is, where it's just this ruminating on something that has already happened. It's very anxious thinking pattern, I think, and people can just get stuck in it. And so let them do it.

(00:17:16):
It's like when you get bad feedback or critical feedback and you naturally have this reaction of, "Oh, well, that's not fair because they don't understand. I actually have numbers I have to deliver on, or I only had 10 minutes to do this, so of course, it wasn't perfect." You naturally come up with these reasons why you are actually not wrong, and that's fine. I don't want to say you should feel bad for doing that.

(00:17:45):
Let yourself have the pity party, let yourself feel those things, but then you got to move on as quickly as possible because those feelings, they actually do tend to spiral and get worse if you're not actively working against them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
Oftentimes these sorts of lessons come from the person experiencing this themselves. Is this something that you dealt with when you're starting your career or even now?

Hilary Gridley (00:18:08):
Oh, absolutely, 100%. And I think it is more than just my career, but just my general mental health and my life. A lot of where this comes from is a concept in cognitive behavioral therapy called behavioral activation. And in my former job, I was working for a company called Big Health and we make digital therapeutics. So those are mobile apps that have been clinically validated to treat behavioral conditions like insomnia, depression, anxiety.

(00:18:39):
And I was working on a new depression therapeutic, and so went very deep on this and was working with a really wonderful clinical team full of clinical psychologists who helped me understand the techniques that therapists use when they are working with people who have depression. And so much of depression is characterized by these negative thinking patterns and this feeling that I feel bad and I just need to wait until I feel better, and then I'll start doing the things that are good for me.

(00:19:09):
I don't feel like responding to this text, so I'm just not going to do it, but I'll respond when I feel better. I don't feel like working out, so I'm not going to do it, but I'll do it when I feel better. And the truth is that doesn't go away on its own, especially if you have depression. Again, the idea of behavioral activation is you have to identify these actions that you can take that will reverse that negative spiral and will improve your mood.

(00:19:41):
And so the misconception is I'll feel better and then I'll act. And the thing that therapists try to teach people, they're working with them in therapy is I will act and then I will feel better. But acting is hard if you are in the furrows of depression. And so easier said than done. And a lot of the work is in how you help people identify specific actions that they can take that will reliably lift their mood.

(00:20:06):
I mean, I have a list of myself. I've got a list on my phone of my behavioral activations, and it's things that I know I can do if I start feeling like the walls are closing around me, if I feel myself getting sucked into very low mood or negative thinking, or whatever it is. You can see how effective that is at just getting you out of there versus the instinct to just go and lay in bed and feel bad for yourself, which I understand very well.

(00:20:35):
And so understanding that concept, which is at its core a therapeutic concept used in cognitive behavioral therapy, but it changed how I see the entire world and how I see, especially as a manager, the ways that people on my team think and behave and how easy it is to get stuck in some of these downward spirals that you really need to actively push back on. And as a manager, I want to help them do that.

(00:21:03):
I want to help them, A, see that, see the ways they are in some ways sabotaging themselves, getting in their own ways with whatever is going on in their head. And then I want to help them counter-program it in themselves. And also, as I said, counter-program the things that you are worried about out there as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):
So interesting. So the core of this technique is what's an action, and you said this, it could be very small.

Hilary Gridley (00:21:28):
Very small.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:29):
That you can take that in this case shows someone else you're not who they think you are. You're worried they think about you in a certain way and you want to take an action that helps them see you're not that.

Hilary Gridley (00:21:40):
So yes, that's the taking the punch concept. The behavioral activation could be anything. It can be picking up a piece of laundry off of the chair and putting it away, and that's just enough to get you out of the downward thing you're in. So behavioral activation just conceptually is, how are you taking action to reverse the downward feeling or the negative feeling that you're feeling? And then the take a punch concept is that applied in the context of I'm in a working environment.

(00:22:10):
I am very conscious of how I'm being perceived by other people. That's causing me a great deal of stress. I think especially for product people who are... So much of their self identity is wrapped up in having the answers, being competent, getting things done. And so many of them have been people who have been really good at that for most of their careers, which is how they got into these jobs in the first place.

(00:22:32):
I think that can be an extremely stressful thing for them. That in many cases can be the driver of burnout and the driver of I can't really handle the stress of this job anymore. And so I think the take a punch concept is more just applied to that specific problem of I'm struggling at work and I'm struggling largely because of my perceptions of other people and I want to feel more agency in that situation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):
This is so cool. On the idea of the specific take a punch concept, what kind of impact have you seen this have on people's mood and careers? How big a deal is this specific tactic?

Hilary Gridley (00:23:13):
Well, I think it's a big deal on two levels. One, it's a big deal because it can help you in a crisis or a minor crisis. But I actually think it's a bigger deal because I see so many people who don't put themselves out there because they're afraid of how it's going to go. And so I think of the classic example of I'm often trying to encourage people to speak up in meetings more, to practice the skill of how you move a conversation forward in a way that can contribute value, both because doing so I think is important because nobody wants to be in bad meetings, but also because it will help with your career.

(00:23:52):
This is how you get on people's radar as somebody who's like, "Oh, that person's got great ideas, thinks about things the right way," whatever it is. I think it's one of these things that I talk to people about it and they are interested in coming to the meeting and hearing about these big decisions are getting made, but they just want to sit there and observe. And I'm like, first of all, every additional person in a meeting has a cost, because every additional person in a meeting makes the people in that meeting less candid than they would have been if there were fewer people in that meeting.

(00:24:23):
And so one key piece of a meeting is you usually have a problem you're trying to solve collectively as a group. And it's really hard to do that if people are being overly cautious about what they're saying because there's too many people in there. So when I tell people this, I'm like, "It's really important that you earn your place in this meeting and let's work on how to do that."

(00:24:46):
And the core piece of that is you've got to say stuff that's valuable. And people always come up with all these excuses for why they can't do it. And one thing I've learned is that I think people are really good at coming up with very rational sounding reasons to not do things that just make them uncomfortable. But in their head they're like, "Oh no, I'm too junior.

(00:25:07):
Nobody wants to hear what I have to say. Or everyone was already thinking it. Or I like to process things internally. And by the time I say them, the conversation moved on," whatever it is. So much of that skill, it's like a communication skill at its core, it's just how to express yourself verbally, but so much of the blocker of that is I think fear. Fear of saying the wrong thing.

(00:25:30):
Fear of looking stupid. Fear of just the discomfort of everyone in a room turning and looking at you as you're trying to formulate a half-baked thought. And so if you can help people be less afraid of that, that's 90% of the challenge of actually improving some of these skills. And so I think when you give people the skills of taking a punch, you are helping them feel less afraid of getting the punch in the first place. And that's why I think it's so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:58):
That's profound, the second order effect of the skill. There's something you mentioned when we were chatting earlier that stuck with me with this idea that too many PMs and too many people are playing on easy mode and not trying hard things.

Hilary Gridley (00:26:10):
Uh-oh. Maybe we'll get ourselves in trouble here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):
Okay, let's do it. Say more.

Hilary Gridley (00:26:16):
Oh, I think this is my hot take. You hear people talking about craft and taste and product management, and it's all very wonderful. And I'm totally on board. I love it. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing, but I'm like, well, if you are really in it just for pure love of the game, you just love product management, why are you building products for people exactly like you who have all your exact same at a company that sells to other companies that doesn't worry about pricing?

(00:26:50):
There's no real... I mean, I don't want to act like I think this is easy, to be clear. But in the grand scheme of things, I wish that the people who have this pure love of product management and have this pure love of building things that you would see more of that applied to building for low income people, building for social services, things like that, that really, really need that kind of work.

(00:27:16):
And I think there's a level of prestige obviously associated with working in certain companies, and you get less of that in other industries. And so people would naturally gravitate toward that. I totally get it. I totally get it. You get paid better. No real judgment from me. I wish I saw more, but I wish that you would see more people. And I'll say this, I know there's a lot of you out there.

(00:27:37):
I know there's a ton of people out there doing really, really important work in really, really hard spaces, and I see you and I appreciate it and shout out to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
Awesome. Okay, I'm glad you shared that. Thank you. I think this will resonate with a lot of people. I want to move on to another trait/habits/skill that you are good at and help people learn, which is being very transparent in what's happening within the organization, within your thinking. You almost help people think the way you think and see the way you think so that they can operate at a higher level. Just talk about that, what that looks like and why that's important.

Hilary Gridley (00:28:13):
It's interesting, I think another thing I hear a lot of people complain about in organizations is the why do 10 people have to sign off on this email before I send it kind of problem. And I think the answer to that is because those 10 people all have different information, different context, and in many cases, completely different working models for how the CEO of the company and other strategic leaders in the company think.

(00:28:42):
And it makes things super inefficient. I think people will often say like, "Oh, it's a process problem." It's not a process problem. It's not approval problem. I think it's a transparency and it's communication problem, like downward communication, outward communication. And what I mean by that is when I think about artifact-based communication, so reading a strategy document for...

Hilary Gridley (00:29:00):
About artifact-based communication. So reading a strategy document, for example. Everyone at the company reads the strategy document. Great. Everyone is working from the same idea of what the strategy is. But then things change, right? Especially if you're working in a really dynamic space, new competitive threats emerge, new opportunities emerge all the time. This is especially true now with AI. Obviously everyone is lighting their strategies on fire and trying to figure out the best way to sort of transform their organization. And so if the way that you understand what's going on at the company is from reading a document that was written six months ago, you're going to be working from outdated information and you're not going to be able to think and respond to new things that happen.

(00:29:44):
And so what is much more helpful than understanding what your CEO thinks is, I think understanding how your CEO thinks. And that goes for all sorts of levels of the company. I want to understand how all the strategic leaders at my company think, and I want my team to understand how I think. And when I feel confident that people on my team understand how I think, I don't need to read their emails, I don't need to approve things. The times where I feel like I need to do that is because I'm working with people where I'm like, I don't have confidence that these people understand how I think, or I don't have confidence that they understand how this email or whatever it is, is going to be received by this important person.

(00:30:28):
And so I try to teach that to my team. And the way that I do that is a few ways. First, I'm in meetings with people, important people at the company. So I'm constantly hearing the things that they're saying and paying attention to sort of the note behind the note. Why do I think they're saying this? What insight do they have that they're bringing to this conversation that might not be obvious? And I try to make an effort every week. I don't always do it, but I try to send my team just a quick rundown in Slack of, "Here are the most important conversations or the most interesting conversations I had this week. Here's what that person said verbatim."

(00:31:07):
Again, I write a lot of notes so I've got it. If you've got a transcriber, maybe that'll help you. "And here's what I interpret that as. Here's why I think they say that. Here's where I think that's coming from and here's what I'm going to do differently as a result." And these aren't long. And sometimes if I don't have time, I'll just, in a team meeting, I'll literally just go through my notes from the week and sort of voiceover stuff and editorialize it as I go. And over time, I think my team has a pretty good sense of what people are saying and how to think about the thinking behind it and how this person thinks, how this person thinks and how I think. And I think when you get an entire organization working that way where everyone's working from the same models of what the CEO thinks matters, what level of risk tolerance the company has, things like that, then you can actually start to move much, much faster and communication becomes much, much, much less painful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:04):
So the tactic here is to help your teams kind of build a mental model of everyone in the company that matters so that it's... The way you put it almost is when they're emailing them or asking for something, they already know how they're going to respond. Is they're an example you could share of something like this, of just something a person at Whoop of how they think? I don't know, maybe you could keep it anonymous just to make this a little reel of the kind of mental model you might want to build around someone.

Hilary Gridley (00:32:29):
So our CEO, Will, is somebody who obsesses over pixels in a way that is challenging to get things through design review, but I think results in a product that is a thousand times better than it would be if he were accepting of small excuses here and there for, "Oh, well this, we had to cut scope here. We couldn't quite do what they wanted here." He sets a high bar and he holds it and he doesn't compromise. And I think this can sometimes get misconstrued, and I think a lot of people might think that he just wants maximal scope on everything. And I think that is a misunderstanding of what he cares about.

(00:33:18):
We often get feedback from him that's like, "This doesn't feel like the future and everything that we're building needs to feel like the future." A lot of people hear that and they're kind of like, "Oh gosh, we're never going to get this thing done on time. We can't make any sort of sacrifices to scope or anything like that." But when I hear that, what I hear is more that we have this AI coach in the product, we have all this amazing data in the product. We're tracking every single one of your heartbeats and we're pulling at all this other data and we have every screen is a moment to show that to people in a way that feels like something that has never existed before.

(00:33:59):
And there are small ways to do that, right? It's like how you pull in. If you're explaining a concept like VO2 Max, which is a measure of your cardiovascular health, you can explain that to people with static content or you can explain that to people by bringing their data into the method of explanation that you're using. You can make it really conversational because you're using this AI coach. You can make it feel more like you're talking to a person and a person who by the way has all the data about you, which doesn't exist today.

(00:34:29):
Your doctor doesn't have that, your coach doesn't have that. And that's not like, "Oh gosh, we've got to blow up the scope on this thing and make it a hundred X as big." But it's finding these little touches to say, "Wow, that was really magical, that was really thoughtful and this feels like the future. This feels like I'm very conscious of the fact that this product knows so much about me and is able to sort out the signal from the noise on that in these really small and elegant ways." And so for something like that, I would get that feedback in design review or I'd hear that in a design review and maybe one of my PMs would be in that design review.

(00:35:05):
And so I bring that to the team. And I hear of things like that in a few different design reviews. So I bring those back to the team and I'm like, "I've noticed that recently we are consistently getting this type of feedback. Here's why I think it's really important to Will, because I think he's really focused on building the health company of the future. And I don't want you all to think that this just means we have to just throw AI at everything and we have to just throw maximum scope at everything.

(00:35:32):
I think the key is understanding on the matrix of cost and effort for impact, what are those high impact but low cost ways that we can just find and sprinkle through the experience and really try to make that magical?" So I'm connecting the dots for my team. Right? I'm saying, "You weren't in all these meetings, but I saw it. Here's what I heard. Here's my interpretation of what I heard, and here's how I'm thinking about how this other person thinks about it. And so as a result, here are some things that I think we can do across our product going forward."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:06):
Essentially these are principles, values, or tenets per person of what matters to them.

Hilary Gridley (00:36:06):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):
So for Nick it's, "This needs to feel like we're living in the future." It can't just be like another heartbeat dragging out.

Hilary Gridley (00:36:18):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):
This is so cool. And there's so many trickle-down benefit to this. One is people feel like they're aware of what's happening. That's one of the most common, I think, piece of feedback people have with big companies. Like, "I don't know what's happening." So there's so much visibility to all the secretive stuff happening in the meetings. "I don't know what people are deciding my fates and all these discussions." So I think just even knowing that you're sharing all this is so powerful.

Hilary Gridley (00:36:40):
Well, and on that note, when I approach these conversations, I always try to think of them as, even if I don't agree with the feedback, if I don't agree with the decision, what is the insight that I'm missing? How am I wrong about this? In ways like, what would be true for this other person to be right? And I'll go through that thought exercise and I might not get to the other side and agree with it. I might still think I'm right or whatever. But oftentimes it forcing myself to think that way forces me to think about how this other person thinks it. And if I do that enough, I will be like, "Oh, this makes sense. I think this makes sense if. I think this makes sense if, and oh, maybe this other thing is true."

(00:37:18):
And I think when I hear the people, the people who are like, "I don't know what's going on with this company," I think they do the opposite. I think they look for reasons to disagree and they look for holes to poke in, "Well, this decision doesn't make any sense because I came up with something that might be wrong about it." And I think that's another thing, by the way, in terms of just sort of helping your team have the emotional maturity to exist and thrive in an organization is helping them think that way, helping them understand you have a point of view.

(00:37:44):
Your point of view is important, but on some level, you do kind of have to have respect for these other points of view and have the humility to think that maybe they're onto something that you're not onto. And it's amazing how much you can learn into it without having to have all the facts just by doing that. If you're like, "Well, this person's behavior makes sense in a situation where X, Y, and Z is happening," oftentimes you'll find that X, Y and Z is happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):
I'm glad you went there. I wanted to actually follow this thread, which is kind of a different direction, but I think a lot of people are always struggling with this as a leader. When your leader disagree, it does say something that you completely disagree with, but you still need to represent that as, "Here's the thing we're doing." But you don't want to be like, "Oh, just because Nick said so." Because you lose power as a leader. Is there something you've learned about how to do that well when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with and you still need to get your team to do it.

Hilary Gridley (00:38:39):
First, I do try to go through the what if I'm wrong exercise. I think a lot of people just sort of expect that if you ask somebody a open-ended question like, "Why are we doing this?" You're going to get a straightforward answer. And oftentimes the answer is not straightforward for various reasons. Maybe there's confidentiality reasons, maybe there's just somebody is acting on a hunch, but that hunch is informed by years or decades of reps of developing judgment, and they're probably really onto something. And it's not just this kind of arbitrary gut feeling. But whatever it is, I really try to get to the bottom of, let me really make sure that I have done my best to understand this person's point of view.

(00:39:23):
And I have some sort of tools for doing that, which I can also talk about. But if I've done that, and I still disagree, I'm relatively candid about that, but candid in a way where it's still respectful. I think what you want to avoid is a situation where as a manager you're like, "Ah, I have no control. This sucks. This decision is so stupid, but that's a job, so we have to do it." Obviously that's not going to set your team up for success or make anybody happy about it, but you do hear that, you do see that happening. And so I think what I try to do in those situations is separate out my opinion from it, from the, " Well, what is the insight that makes it make sense to this person" and explain their rationale.

(00:40:04):
Even if I'm comfortable saying, "I don't necessarily think this isn't how I would do it," or "I don't even really agree with how they're thinking about it, but from their point of view, from their perspective, their professional experience, whatever it is, I could see how this makes sense. And they might be right. I don't think they're right, but they might be. Let's find out. We're not going to find out if we are all squabbling about whether this is a good idea the whole time. The only way we're going to find out is if we give it the best shot that we have and try to do it. And if we're wrong, that happens sometimes and we try again."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):
I like that this comes back to your mental model orientation of, "Here's their mental model, here's what their experience has been like, here's how they see the world, the trends, and then this is why they think the way they think." And so instead of encouraging your team or yourself even to be like, "No, no, you're wrong here." It's more, "Okay, here's their data set, let's try this, and this will inform that data set and maybe change their mind."

Hilary Gridley (00:41:03):
Yeah. Because I think in product, I like to joke, there's no right answers. Right? There's only wrong answers, and you're just trying to execute well on the least wrong answer that's available to you. And so I think it is the sort of reasonable people can disagree about this stuff at all of this is what I think, and this is how I would approach it. I think this is what they think and I think this is why they would approach it this way.

(00:41:27):
And again, the only chance we have of succeeding is not being torn apart on that. And so at the end of the day, if it's not a obviously terrible answer, and sometimes even if it isn't obviously terrible answer, you're still more likely to succeed if you just sort of reorient yourself around a world where it's not a terrible answer and then just try to will that into existence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):
You said that you have some tools to help you understand someone's point of view. I can't help but ask more about that.

Hilary Gridley (00:41:56):
I talk about what I like to call the magic questions, but the thing about magic questions is they're not actually questions, they're statements and they end with, "Do you agree?" Or "Is that right?" And so I have found this, the most helpful way for kind of trying to understand a person's mental model is to just put facts in front of them and see what they say no to and what they say yes to. And then if you can get them to explain, great. And if they're good communicators, they often can, but if they're not, you don't have to let that stop you view. And so I mean, I'll do this even just as an example in a non-leadership context with if I'm working with legal teams or compliance teams or things like that, they're often working from a literal set of rules. Right?

(00:42:40):
There are laws, there are regulations, and you are trying to understand if we were to take this path, would that be okay? Would that not be okay? And sometimes that's not straightforward. Sometimes there's regulatory areas that are up to interpretation. And so when I first started working in a regulated space, I would find this kind of frustrating and confusing because I would say, "Can you just give me the rule so I can understand what's right and what's left of it?" And they'd be like, "Oh, well, it depends. It depends, it depends." And so I learned that if I kind of flip that and approached that, "Well, what if we did X, Y, and Z?

(00:43:22):
What if this is what it looked like? What if this is what the copy said? Would that be okay?" No, yes. If no, why? If yes, why? And so I'm sort of teasing out the mental model rather than asking them to explain it to me. And this is what I tell my team all the time to do this to me. When they come to me and they say, "Well, what do you think I should do?" Or "What could I have done differently?" I'll say, "Rephrase that as 'Tell me what you think you could have done differently.' And then ask me if I agree." And when I do this, I think it has a few benefits. One, it helps them kind of calibrate their judgment over time.

(00:43:58):
So they're actually forcing themselves to make this assertion. And then they're kind of calibrating how close that was to how I would think about it, which will get you much faster, much further than just asking open-ended questions and getting the answer. And then the second part of it is they don't become reliant on me for answering these questions. I think that's kind of a trap that a lot of managers fall into is people come to you with questions, you want to help them, you answer the question, and then you find that they come to you with all their questions and you're kind of like, "Yeah, you got to solve some of these on your own." So again, I think the magic questions to me, is that right? Do you agree? And anytime you find yourself tempted to ask an open-ended question to somebody whose brain you're trying to understand, stop yourself and say, "Let me just say that. Let me say as a statement what I think," and then try to calibrate based on their reaction. And I think that's the fastest way to understand how another person thinks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:51):
It makes me think about a lot of people, it could come across as it's a weird manipulative way of asking someone stuff, but it turns out that we're not good at really knowing what we think or know a lot of times. And you need someone almost to interview you in a really effective way to get out all this knowledge. And this is just a really simple way of getting that idea.

Hilary Gridley (00:45:10):
It's funny because when I talk about this, I get that reaction a lot where people are like, "Well, doesn't it feel coercive?" And I'm like, "Well, you got to go in pure of heart." You've got to go in open to being wrong and even expected to be wrong. And you have to make that clear to them. Right? If you're coming in and you're like, "Here's what I think. You agree? You agree?" Of course you're not getting the answer you want. Or you might get the answer you want, I might get a yes. If your goal is to get to yes, that's not what I'm talking about.

(00:45:36):
If your goal is to understand and you are coming from a, "Help me understand how I'm wrong, help me understand what I'm getting wrong here" and approach it with that sort of curiosity and humility and make sure that you're caring yourself and presenting yourself to this person in a way that shows that, that you're not coming in hostile or forceful or something. Yeah. Because there are absolutely circumstances where you're doing that and you're going to get bad intel because you're making the person uncomfortable, so they're going to lie to you. But that's I think, a whole set of interpersonal skill that we probably don't have time to talk about today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:09):
I wanted to come back to, you said this interesting insight about your CO that he wanted to build something that felt like the future. I just wanted to share, there's a story that has always stuck with me at Airbnb. There was a big launch coming up and there was a designer sitting late in the office trying to update the website to include this new product. It was a launch of Airbnb Neighborhoods, I don't know, 10 years ago. And she was just like, "Hey, Joe." And this is Joe Gebbia was walking around the office. And she's like, "Hey Joe, what do you want the website to be?

(00:46:41):
What do you want it to look like? What should we try to..." And it was going to launch in two days. He's like, "Build something the internet has never seen before." And now this makes... It's interesting because when I always think about that story and tell that story, it's like, this is a crazy ask. And now as you share an approach for how to handle something like that, it really changes my perspective to like, "Okay, what's Joe's worldview? Why is that the way he saw the world and why we needed to build a site like that,?" Which I could start thinking about, but that's a really interesting way to just handle things that sound absurd and out of nowhere.

Hilary Gridley (00:47:18):
I agree so much. I proud former English major, and so I'm a huge proponent of reading fiction and reading in general. And I feel like that's where so much of this comes from for me. It is just a curiosity for in what world does this make sense for this person? And it's so easy to look at another person's behaviors, another person's actions and what they say and just be like, "That doesn't make any sense." And I find that, I don't know, your relationships become so much richer, even just in a work context, when you approach it with that, "What is the world of this person where the thing that they're saying makes sense?"

(00:47:58):
And I feel like in my life, honestly, a lot of my frustration has come from being frustrated with other people. And so this is something that I've had to learn over time. Because when I come home from work and I'm just like, "Oh, this person said this and it didn't make any sense, and this person's totally out to lunch and leadership doesn't know what's going on." All I was doing was making myself miserable.

(00:48:21):
And actually worse than that, I was making myself miserable and I was making myself pretty useless to the company. And so I would get frustrated because I was like, " No, nobody appreciates my perfect, unique, beautiful insight and all these other people have no unique, beautiful, perfect, concise, just wrong opinions." And so I feel like that's been a big area of growth for me, honestly, is learning to approach people that way. It's not just like, "Oh, this is a nice thing to do," but I think it genuinely makes me a happier person. And yeah, I think a lot of it comes from reading fiction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
I love that we're just unpacking the onion of the power of this very specific habit of just helping you learn the mental model of the people around you. And-

Hilary Gridley (00:49:05):
I feel like this is just making me sound like a crazy force.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):
No, there's so much power to this. As you talk, I'm like, "Wow, there's so much value here." Because not only is it, you talk about how this is the source of a lot of burnout for a lot of people where they're just so frustrated, the CEO or the chief product officer, designers just like, "I hate this." Why are they just asking all these ridiculous things, keeping the bar way too high? It's just nothing's ever good enough."

(00:49:26):
But not only does it help you feel better about their asks, because you can understand where they're coming from, it also helps you be more effective and helping them change their mind potentially and see a different perspective because now you see the data that informs their perspective and you could help adjust that or kind of poke at it like, "Hey, are you sure this is true? Are you sure I don't know, they're a competitor and this is how they see it. Maybe it's not. Let's look into that a little deeper."

Hilary Gridley (00:49:54):
Yeah, it's really interesting. At my last company when I started reporting to the CEO, they found various coaches for me to work with, and one of them was the former chief product officer at Coinbase who's gone to found Bridge, which is just that apart by Stripe for a ton of money. One thing that he said to me that really stuck with me is when you're reporting to the CEO and as a chief product officer, the big mistake that people make is they think that the game is all about getting what is inside their head and influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them to make it so, and if you go into the role trying to do that, you're going to fail because actually what your job is to do is to understand what the CEO's vision is and what they care about, again, sort of how they think about things and figure out how to operationalize that in a way that results in the best possible manifestation of it in the form of product.

(00:50:56):
And that was just such a radically different way from what I ever thought my job was. Again, to go back to sort of the fiction example, you kind of come up thinking you're the protagonist. And you can be the protagonist in your life. You can be the protagonist in the story of your family, but in the story of your work of a company, you are probably not the protagonist. And as much as it can feel kind of weird to say that I genuinely think some of the best advice I've got in my life in terms of things that have just not only transformed how I see the world and how I act in it, but just my own sense of happiness is you're not special. And I used to spend so much time and energy just being like, "Oh, people don't see it my way and I have to convince them.

(00:51:49):
And when you're in an organization, it's an ecosystem. Right? It's an organization full of people who are all trying to work together to get a thing done. And if every single one of those people is operating from their own protagonist viewpoint of "This is how I actually see the world, this is what I think we're here to do and I need to convince everyone around me at all times," it becomes extremely inefficient. It becomes extremely painful, because everyone's just fighting all the time. And so in some ways it feels like you're kind of, it sounds almost defeatist.

(00:52:20):
I'm always worried about the sounding. I'm just like, "Yeah, just do whatever the boss says." And that's not how I feel at all. I think it's incredibly important to bring your skills and your talents and your perspective to the job you have and really your taste and your craft and all of these things. But I do think this idea of understanding how to build a shared mental model of everyone together that definitionally cannot be defined by your own narrow perspective, actually just makes work a lot better for everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:49):
So then a lot of people, like you said, I love that you went there, is just like if you're, because it could sound like, okay, your job is just to execute what the CO tells you. There's no value to your insights and perspectives, and you're just get out of the way. You're just get everyone to do the thing the CO wants. Where do you... I guess, in your experience or just advice on where's the fulfillment for you then as a CPO or example or a director of product where it's not that fun just to be there executing a CO's vision and not have any input?

Hilary Gridley (00:53:20):
Well, and I think there's so many decisions all the way down and there's so many micro places where you can zig where others would've zagged. And I think I personally, a lot of where my fulfillment comes from is from feeling like if somebody else were in this job, it would be done differently. And something about the product is different because I was the one who worked on it because I was in the job. And that comes from my unique perspective, my unique point of view, the experiences I've had in the past, my various influences. And I think it's trying to figure out the right level for it so that you're not pushing against an immovable force.

(00:54:03):
It's almost like if you're playing Jenga and you're sort of trying to feel around to find, okay, well, where are the pieces that can move? And when you know how somebody else thinks A, you can find that there are immovable forces. Those are not the battles worth fighting. But there are also areas where maybe they don't know as much, and there's also areas where maybe they're actually kind of scared because they don't know as much. And maybe that's an area where you have an interesting point of view. And so you can step into that role and be tremendously valuable and being tremendously influential.

(00:54:33):
But you can only do that if you have a good frame for kind of what the model is and where are the things where it's like, okay, we are operating on a person's insight here that is itself extremely unique and extremely valuable, and it is the reason this company even exists in the first place. But that, I mean, there's millions of decisions have to get made, you know what I mean? And there's millions of different places that you can put yourself. And so I think it's just kind of constantly feeling out for where are the places that I'm really spiky? Where are the things that I think I do really well? Where are the gaps? And again, you can only find those if you're engaging really good faith and engaging earnestly and really understanding how other people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:19):
There's two really interesting thoughts that I have as you're talking that I think will even further crystallize what you're saying. One is that you're just saying, this is the way the world works. It makes me think about Jeffrey Pfeffer, he was a guest on this podcast. He teaches this class at Stanford Business School about how to gain power in the world. It's like the rules of power. And he talks about, and it's all these ways to influence and win and achieve and gain status and all these things.

(00:55:45):
And he's like, this part doesn't sound fun and great, but I talk about here's the way the world works and is not the way you wish it would be. And what you're describing is the way a company works is the CO in charge and your job is to, they're the boss. And the sooner you understand their vision trumps your vision, the easier everything gets. You're not there to tell the CO, "Here's what we should be building." Right? Their job is to own the vision of the business and the company.

Hilary Gridley (00:56:18):
Yeah, I think that's true. And if you disagree with it, you probably shouldn't be working at that company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):
Yeah. The other piece is, it's just the vision. Here's the vision of the future of where we're heading. If we win, here's what will be true and the world will look like. But there's so much more that you need to figure out that is to achieve that vision. And that's basically the role of the CPO and director of products, all those sorts of folks-

Hilary Gridley (00:56:41):
And of everyone at that level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:41):
Everyone at the company.

Hilary Gridley (00:56:43):
And I think how you said it there is so right on, because it is like, the vision is in many ways, I mean, in some ways it's execution base, but in many ways it's a vision of what the world is going to look like in five years, in 10 years. And so in some ways, I would say your job is, if you can understand that and you can understand here's what this person thinks the world is going to look like, assuming all that is true, what are the things that I can do to maximize the chances of that and becoming the actual future?

(00:57:18):
And then also, what does that mean for a product? What does that mean for if it has to be true? That take Whoop, for example, if there's a vision of the future where you have all of your health data in one place and we're able to detect health issues before you even know you have them and we're able to do really hyper-personalized coaching to help you understand how your behaviors today are impacting how healthy you're going to be in decades, what does that mean for what Whoop needs to be today and what does that mean for how it needs to evolve in the next couple of years in order to both make that a reality but also win in that world. And I do think that's exactly where the people in the right.

Hilary Gridley (00:58:00):
And I do think that's exactly where the people in the rank and file can be tremendously influential. It's that level of, "I'm going to fight with you about how the world's going to work in five years," where I think you're just fighting a losing battle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:13):
And if you don't like the vision, you could leave, right? It's like, or try to change it. Those are two options.

Hilary Gridley (00:58:18):
And I think, to your point about pushing back, because you asked about this. Again, I never want it to sound like I'm just defeatist, "just accept it." I'm a very opinionated person.

(00:58:28):
I go to the mat for things that I think are true, and so, I teach my team, "You have to be really good at forming arguments, and that can show up in different ways."

(00:58:40):
Some people are really good at doing that with data. Some people are really good at doing that with the qual and the quant, and moving it together. But you have to be able to advocate for what you think is true in the most compelling way possible. And you have an obligation to do it.

(00:58:56):
And if you have done it, and you've done it well, and it didn't work, that's when it's time to say, "Well, maybe there's something here that I wasn't seeing previously." And that's where I think it's time to have some humility around it.

(00:59:09):
But it's a journey. You don't start from, "Well, I got nothing to say here." So I think knowing where you are on that journey is important, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):
This reminds me, there's a PM leader at Airbnb, who ended up leading a new initiative, and they ended up doing a bunch of stupid stuff. And he's like, "I'm realizing that it's me that needs to be pushing back on stuff, now that I'm in charge of this product team. I'm the person that needs to convince the CEO this is a bad idea." And I am just realizing, that after doing a bunch of stuff, that it was stupid.

Hilary Gridley (00:59:44):
You will see that idea is that you do have an obligation to try to convince them that it's a bad idea. And you're going to be right sometimes, and you're not going to be right every time.

(00:59:51):
I think that that's why it's so hard to talk about these things in absolutes, because sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're not right. And it is important to get really good at knowing the difference, and knowing where you go from there.

(01:01:03):
I want to move on to another skill you really get at, but first of all, something I noted, that I wanted to touch on real quick. You mentioned that WHOOP now does VO2 Max, and this is not a promotion for WHOOP, but that's so cool.

(01:01:12):
That's a huge thing to track, that this is the thing that Peter Thiel and all these guys are always saying, "This is the thing you want to track, to understand your health and progress as your VO2 Max. It's like your blood oxygen level." I don't know exactly what it's, but that's cool. The new WHOOP lets you do that.

Hilary Gridley (01:01:28):
There's so much cool stuff we're doing right now. I'm like, I don't know if I want to get into it all right now, but I can.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):
We'll get back to it. We'll get back to it.

Hilary Gridley (01:01:34):
All right. Let's get back to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. So another habit/skill that you are really good at, that I've heard from folks is, and you've mentioned this a couple times, is just building habits, helping your team build good habits.

(01:01:49):
And coming back to the CBT stuff, just like behavior loops and things like that. Talk about just what that is, why that's important, what you help your team learn there.

Hilary Gridley (01:01:58):
Yeah, I'm obsessed with habit formation, and reward loops and behavior change, and all of these things. And when I think about trying to change behavior on your team, or just trying to encourage your team to do more of the behaviors that you believe are associated with success, I think a lot of people think about it more of an education model, where it's like, you teach the thing, you assess the thing, and then there's some accountability around the thing.

(01:02:27):
And I think, if you think about it more in the context of behavioral psychology, it actually works a lot better. So I'll give you an example. Many leaders have been trying to think about how to drive AI adoption, AI upscaling on my team, and what that can look like.

(01:02:48):
And when I talk to people about this outside of the company, I'm always surprised like, "Well, how do you measure it, and how do you enforce it?" And I don't really think about any of that stuff. I'm thinking about, "How am I creating habits around using this?"

(01:03:05):
And for me, there's a couple of things there. So it's consistency. How are you getting someone doing something every single day? And to do that, it has to start small. It has to start super easy. You have to give them things that take no more than a minute or two to do.

(01:03:21):
And actually, I have a 30 days of GPT, I call it, of a list of 30 things to do, one every single day, that I don't know anyone who has gone through this, and not come out the other side, feeling a hundred times more confident in their skills, and actually using it every day as a habit, because it's built as a habit formation tool, and not an education tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):
And this is using a specific GPT build, or building their own GPT, or what's the habit there?

Hilary Gridley (01:03:45):
The habit is using ChatGPT, or Claude, or any of these tools-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
Oh, okay. Okay, got it. I got it.

Hilary Gridley (01:03:50):
... [inaudible 01:03:50] tools, to get their work done, in just a generic and get work done way. And so, I have this little tool, if you sign up for my newsletter, I'll send it to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):
What's the URL of the newsletter, as you mention that?

Hilary Gridley (01:04:03):
Thanks for asking. It is hils.substack.com, H-I-L-S, substack.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):
Sweet.

Hilary Gridley (01:04:09):
But basically, it's one little thing you can do every single day. And the key with this is, again, consistency. So you need to get people doing this thing every day, reducing friction. I think a mistake a lot of people make when they start thinking about how to drive adoption is, they're like, "Oh, we have to show people how to do their work with these tools."

(01:04:27):
But I'm like, "Well, work is hard." And if you are on a deadline for something, you've got to get something done, the last thing that you ever want is more friction associated with getting it done. It is so annoying when you're trying to get a thing done, and your tools are being changed on you, and you don't know how the thing works, and the hot keys are all different, or whatever.

(01:04:50):
So I actually think, using it in situations that have nothing to do with your work are way easier, because you're removing all of that friction of, "Oh wait, I got to go think about, 'All right, what's a project that I'm working on? Oh, I put this into ChatGPT, and I didn't really get a good answer.'"

(01:05:08):
Or, "Now I'm frustrated, because this thing's taking longer than I need it to take, or whatever." I start with things that are just fun, simple use cases. It might be coming up with times to take a vacation, or places to go on vacation.

(01:05:24):
Or it might be uploading your calendar into ChatGPT, and asking it for ideas, for talking points for the meetings, or things where the person doesn't have to think, because it's all just spelled out.

(01:05:36):
And things where there's no external work pressure, that you have to apply this to, that's going to make it an unpleasant experience. So consistency, reduce friction. And then, most importantly, designing reward loops.

(01:05:48):
And this is something, that when I'm talking to people about designing for behavior change, the number one thing I always tell them is, "You are not thinking enough about the reward loop." The reward loop needs to be powerful, it needs to be immediate, and it needs to be emotional, so that when this person does the thing that you want them to do, they feel like a million bucks.

(01:06:09):
When I think about any kind of habit I'm trying to build on my team, that's something that I'm always thinking about, is how can I make sure that when a person does this, they feel really great?

(01:06:19):
And part of why I like Custom GPTs as a tool for helping people learn to use LLMs, and I talk about this on the podcast I did with Claire, on how I AI, is because if you put in the prompt, you as the person building the custom GPT, you write the prompt, you put it in, you design it such that somebody can upload a specific document. And then, they can get a specific output, like feedback on that document, or maybe something more fun than feedback, an improved written version of that document.

(01:06:50):
They get the joy of like, "Oh, this helps me. This was cool," without any of the despair of, "Oh, I'm not very good at prompting, and this didn't really work, and I'm frustrated." And so, I just always think about that in general. If I'm trying to build any kind of habit on my team, it's less about the accountability of how I'm enforcing this, and more about how I make it so rewarding for people to do it, that they do it naturally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):
I wrote down notes as you were talking, so kind of, the four parts of habits, and I'm going to ask you for an example, to help people see how this actually works in real life. But basically, to help people build an actual habit, the three steps are the three things you want to focus on, consistency, friction, and reward loop. And within reward loop, you want it to be powerful, immediate, and emotional. What is an example of this?

Hilary Gridley (01:07:40):
Yeah, I can give some, actually, examples of how we do this in product, if that would be interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):
Absolutely.

Hilary Gridley (01:07:46):
Because I think there's something WHOOP is really good at. So I think one of the most interesting kind of anti-reward loops on WHOOP is around alcohol. WHOOP has this recovery system. You get a recovery score every morning. It's red, yellow, green, and it's basically how recovered you are, and how ready you are to take on the day.

(01:08:05):
And if you drink, and you're on WHOOP, you will very quickly learn that any time you drink, you get a red recovery. It's so interesting, because it's not like people who were drinking weren't getting hangovers before, or they knew that it was disrupting their sleep. None of this is news for people, but there's something about seeing that red score that just feels like, it just feels bad. It has this really profound emotional impact on people.

(01:08:38):
And when you see the green score, it feels great. It's like, "Ooh, I'm doing something well, I'm taking care of myself. I'm a healthy person." And I hear this when I talk to members all the time, and I hear people say, "I've had problems with my drinking for years. And it wasn't until I got on WHOOP, that I was really able to get a handle on my drinking."

(01:08:58):
I'm always, again, amazed by this, because I'm like, "You had all the information you needed before," but there's something about the, you wake up, and you get that red score, that's just, it manages to override whatever was driving people to do it in the first place.

(01:09:14):
And then, I think, continuing to have that data, where you can look back at your data and see, "Oh, that was the red day, that was the day that I did this thing." And it's something that we've actually been trying to find ways to do this in a longer term way.

(01:09:28):
Because when you have these short reward loops, it's easier, where it's like, "I did a thing." And then, I immediately either got a reward, Green Recovery, or got an anti-reward, Red Recovery, and that is changing my behavior as a result.

(01:09:40):
And we have this new feature, Healthspan, that we just launched with our new hardware. And basically, what it's trying to do is help you have this reward loop, between your behaviors and activities that you're doing today, and what means for how healthy you're going to be in 20, 30, 40 years.

(01:09:59):
And so, we have something similar where we have this, we call it the Amoeba. It has your WHOOP age in it. It has colors, and moves around, and that changes, based on how your behaviors and your activities change, every single day.

(01:10:12):
And the colors change when you're doing better, and when you're doing worse. And you can kind of see it all broken down, how you sleep, your VO2 Max, the consistency of your sleep, how much time you're spending in different heart rate zones, how much time you're spending in strength training, things like that.

(01:10:27):
And we found that, again, it's just this incredibly powerful reward loop, because we're taking something that historically has been really, really hard, which is, "When I make healthy changes today, not only do I not see the results of those for decades, but the short term reward loop of those often feels pretty bad, because change is hard, and it feels bad before it feels good."

(01:10:46):
And trying to build that reward loop that is more rewarding for people to see those numbers change, and to see those colors change, so that they're actually able to make those changes, and see that progress, and feel really good about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:59):
I love that you're using all these habit building tactics that folks have been using historically, to get you to check your Instagram likes, and your Facebook posts for actual good, for helping people live longer and happier. That makes me very happy.

(01:11:14):
Is there an example of doing this sort of thing with your team, of helping them build, and you talk about AI learning to use Claude, ChatGPT?

Hilary Gridley (01:11:21):
Yeah, I think with AI, I think a lot of it's just shouting people out, right? When somebody is using AI to solve a problem that they wouldn't have used AI before, give them a shout-out in the team meeting, let them demo that.

(01:11:37):
Again, make them feel like a million bucks for doing the thing. And people respond to that, people will see, I mean, maybe it's because I work at WHOOP, and we're all obsessed with reward loops, so we're all choosing them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:46):
Or reward looping each other. "Here's your reward."

Hilary Gridley (01:11:50):
No, exactly. But no, people see that, and people respond to it. I think another example is something that I think about a lot, and is relevant to our conversation about, just how you build teams that can do hard things, is how you encourage people to take care of themselves outside of work. And it's something that I'm always trying to model for my team, and make it really visible the ways that I'm doing this, and sort of having my hobbies, and my other various things.

(01:12:18):
And as a result, I also try to reward, have these reward loops, when I see people on my team doing the same thing. Because I think people, bosses often inadvertently create reward loops for, "Oh, this person, they had to stay up till two o'clock to get it done, but they got it done." When you create those reward loops, that's the behavior that people start mimicking.

(01:12:38):
And so, I try to do the opposite. I try to find ways that I really am impressed with my team, and the ways that they take care of themselves outside of work, because I think that makes them better at their jobs, frankly, and just happier humans. So there's a PM on my team, Emily, who teaches at Handlebar. She's a fitness instructor in her spare time.

(01:12:59):
And so, whenever we have a long meeting, I'll be like, "Oh, Emily, why don't you lead stretches, to get the energy level in the room up? Just nothing serious, just for a minute, before we start the meeting." And it's kind of fun. Everyone has a laugh about it, "Emily's doing her thing," and I'll be like, "Everyone, come check out Emily at Handlebar in Charlestown this Saturday, 10 a.m."

(01:13:22):
And by the way, you all out there in the podcast world should do that if you're in the Boston area, she's great. Shout-out to Emily. But it's things like that. It's just finding these small ways to, because people are already laughing, people are already smiling, we're doing this silly thing, everyone's in a good mood, and I'm like, "Boom, perfect time to give someone a shout-out, and make them feel like a million bucks for doing something, that in many cases, they might think, 'Oh, am I allowed to have this other job outside work? Is this okay?'" And so yeah, you got to proactively build those reward loops.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:50):
I love the reward loop of Emily getting this shout-out right now. This is so meta.

Hilary Gridley (01:13:56):
Ultimate reward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:56):
You have a full class coming up in Boston. Is there anything else along those lines? Because that was really interesting? And also, people, I know managers already kind of do this, just promoting.

(01:14:06):
But so, I think the core lesson here is, focus on things you want to encourage more. Less so, "Hey, they worked the weekend, they got it done, so awesome. Thank you for doing that."

(01:14:16):
You're saying that's almost an anti-pattern, because you don't necessarily want that as a habit. So it's more like, shift your reward announcements to things you actually, intentionally want to create, in a new team.

Hilary Gridley (01:14:26):
Yeah, and just be really, really thoughtful about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):
Yeah, okay. So let's come back to the taking care of yourself, because that's something else that came up, almost everyone mentioned this. So you're doing a good job with this, of finding time to take care of yourself, and modeling that for other people.

(01:14:39):
Specifically, a lot of people commented on how you create space for creativity. And I think, to a lot of people, a lot of PMs, especially, is just, "I have no time for anything. I just have meetings, back to back, all day. I barely have time to go to the bathroom or eat."

(01:14:53):
And I'm curious to hear just how you do this. How do you create space in your day for creative work, and deep work, and thinking outside of the meeting?

Hilary Gridley (01:15:02):
Yeah, it's funny. I'm glad to hear people think I'm good at this, because I'm terrible at organizing events. My team's always, "Oh, we should do a fun event." I'm like, "Yeah, that's a great idea."

(01:15:10):
And then I don't organize it. So I like to think, I do this in other ways. And I do think one of them is just in modeling, how to carve out space for things, and a couple of things. I think there's the creativity, which for me is probably more outside of work. For me, it's creativity.

(01:15:29):
But again, it's a big part of me as a manager, what I think I can help people with is, back to the point of behavioral activation, understanding what the things are that a person needs to be happy, to be their best self, to be a high functioning person. That depends on their values, it depends on a lot of things about them. So for Emily, it's fitness, it's teaching, it's these things. For me, it's having my crafts that I do, my illustration, my writing, my reading, all of these sorts of things.

(01:15:59):
I think that that's the first step is just, as a leader, understanding what those are for people on your team. And then, as I said, modeling it.

(01:16:09):
I try to always tell people, "Here's how I'm doing these things." I talk about them, so it's really normalized, because I think a lot of PMs are like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so busy. I have no time. I'm in meetings all day." But that's a little bit self-inflicted, I think.

(01:16:24):
At some point, you have to be the one responsible for getting yourself out of the weeds, and it's hard to do, but it is doable. So I think, just showing people that it's possible, showing people that you can do these things. And I talk about them, I bring them to lessons.

(01:16:43):
I have a book club that I sometimes require at work, and then I say, "Maybe I don't need to require this anymore," but ways to just make it really visible, make sure people know that I'm doing it, and then ask them about it.

(01:16:56):
If I, in my one on one lens, and I'm checking in with people, I'm asking them, "What do you do for joy? Are you doing something every single day that's bringing you joy in your life?" And if they say no, I'm like, "That's a problem. What are we going to do about that? And do you even know what those things are?"

(01:17:13):
Because I think a lot of people don't, and a lot of people, it's great. They're like, "Oh, I need to be getting X number of hours of exercise, X hours of sleep. I know I need to eat lunch right at 12:00, or else I turn into a pumpkin."

(01:17:26):
If it's somebody who knows what all those things are, and you're just there to kind of help them carve out time, that's one thing. But I think, and a lot of times, people don't even know. Then you kind of behavioral activation them, where you're like, "All right, well, why don't you try some things, and get back to me, and let me know what seemed to work, what seemed to make a difference?"

(01:17:43):
But I do think so much of it is like a permission structure, because people feel the pressure to be like, "Oh, I'm so busy, I'm so busy, I'm in meetings all day.

(01:17:50):
I can't decline these meetings. I can't not do these things." So in many ways, I think just modeling, it gives them the permission structure to start to take back their life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
I could see why people love working for you. Being asked in your one on one, "Have you done anything today that brings you joy? And if you haven't, that's a problem." Wow.

Hilary Gridley (01:18:09):
It's important. It's what life's all out. Why are we here, if it's just to toil, and be miserable?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
And also, they will be better people at work, and they'll do better work. I think that's, tell me, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like that's an element of this.

Hilary Gridley (01:18:24):
Well, and it is so funny, because so much of this stuff, it's obvious when you apply it to an athletic context. And obviously, I talked about the recovery score. This concept of athletes need to recover is very obvious. No one, I think, would argue with that.

(01:18:39):
If you're just pushing yourself at 100% of your physical capacity all the time, not only are you going to burn out, but you're literally going to suffer performance decline. And in the same way, I think in the athletic world, there's so much more, just acceptance of, I don't even want to say limits, but just like, you have to take the time to do the things you need to be your best. And that's not just running into the wall all day.

(01:19:11):
And I think we forget that at work, but I think the analog is 100% there. I also think about this with, in terms of being able to have creative breakthroughs of any kind, it's just so important to have active rest. It's so important to have heads downtime. This stuff is all very well documented. We know it all, but we just come up with excuses to not give it to ourselves. I think it's kind of self-sabotage, at a certain point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:36):
I definitely come up with excuses not to do that, and work all the time. So I could use this advice myself.

Hilary Gridley (01:19:42):
And that's why, here's the thing, here's the thing. The Reason I'm so regimented about this is because, if I'm not, I will fall apart. There's this quote, I can't remember where I saw this, but I love it. It's like, "I have exercised the demons from my head, but they are outside and they are doing pushups."

(01:19:59):
The threat of the demons coming back is always there. And so, I take this stuff really seriously, because I know, if I let myself start to slide into, I'm not doing the things I need to do to take care of myself, I'm going to have a bad time. The walls are going to start closing in around me.

(01:20:18):
And I'm not shy about that. To me, there's no point in torturing myself, and just working so hard, and having no room for joy, and having no room for creativity. Even just from a practical standpoint, I'm just not going to succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
This comes back to your point about, I think it was called behavioral activation, doing the thing. Instead of waiting for you to feel a certain feeling, do the thing that will make you feel that way.

Hilary Gridley (01:20:45):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:46):
Okay. As maybe a final area, but I have a few more questions after this, so maybe not. The final area is AI. I am happy that we waited this long to get deep into AI. We're not going to spend a lot of time here. You wrote a whole guest post about this. You did How I AI to talk through some of this stuff.

(01:21:03):
But when we were talking earlier, you said that you think people still are completely undervaluing the power AI could have on their ability to learn, and improve themselves. And I know you spent a lot of time on this, with all these GPTs you've built.

(01:21:17):
Just talk about the sense of how much you think people still under-appreciate how much power there is in AI, and helping them become better.

Hilary Gridley (01:21:25):
Yeah. I think we are not being nearly creative enough, when it comes to how to think about learning with AI. And I think, you hear people worry about entry level jobs, and when you think about an entry level job, it is sort of inefficient by design, because you have taken analyst, sort of a classic entry level role.

(01:21:49):
They're doing grunt work, they're doing really tedious work, but they're getting a lot of reps in, because that's exactly how you learn the judgment to do higher level jobs well. And I hear this in creative fields too. I hear this from every, I certainly feel this way.

(01:22:05):
The work that I did in the beginning of my career, it didn't feel like it was all that important, in terms of the impact it was having, but it did feel like it was transformative, in terms of my own judgment and my own taste, and how I think about just making very quick judgment calls.

(01:22:27):
Now, I just wouldn't have been able to do that, if I didn't spend years learning. I used to do social media, the skill of having to condense something that I want to say into 120 characters, or whatever it used to be on old Twitter, 240, I can't remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:47):
I forget, actually, isn't that crazy? I forget what the original was. I think it was 140. Okay, 140 characters, yeah.

Hilary Gridley (01:22:50):
140, I think. It was short. And if you had to get a link in there, good luck to you.

(01:22:55):
But oh my gosh, my ability to just look at something written today, and just cut it, that text in half, third, whatever it needs to fill the space, I can do that in my sleep, because I got all these reps very early in my career.

(01:23:10):
I think people see the way that there's a threat of companies not wanting to hire as much entry-level talent, because it's like, "Oh, this is the kind of work that AI can do."

(01:23:24):
The fear that I hear, at least, is if you're not getting those reps early in your career, maybe it's not contributing so much value to the company at that moment, but it's how you learn to be great later on.

(01:23:38):
And so, there's a fear that in five, 10 years, we're just not going to have that class of people, who have learned to do the jobs well, and who have built judgment in that way.

(01:23:48):
But what I think that misses is, it assumes that you go and you do this analyst job for two years, and at the end of it you have a person who knows how to make models really well, knows how to do a few things really well. But why does that have to take two years? Why does that model of you grind over this thing?

(01:24:12):
You wait for feedback. Eventually, you get that feedback. Maybe that feedback's good, maybe it's not. You go back, you try again. It actually is really inefficient, when you think about it.

(01:24:22):
And the sort of learning applicAttions around AI that I get really excited about are, how do you shrink that loop? So in my podcast with Claire, I showed her how I build these GPTs, that kind of think like me. And the purpose of that is so that my team can get feedback that is at least 80% close to the feedback that I would be giving them.

(01:24:44):
But instead of having to wait until I get to their message, or until our one on one, they can get that on demand as many times as they want forever. And I think there's a lot of things like this, of ways that things that require other people, just naturally slow things down, require getting feedback from other people, just naturally slow things down.

(01:25:06):
We can build AI tools that, in my view, there's no reason why the amount of reps that you get at whatever task you're doing, you can be a film editor, just sitting there, poring over the film, deciding what to edit, what to cut, what to put into the trailer, or whatever it's making. That's an incredibly tedious job that takes forever.

(01:25:29):
And I think there's no reason we can't make that way more efficient with AI, that make the learning more fun. And so, I think that that's sort of my hot take is yes, there is this threat of, a lot of these jobs that are things that seem like you can just automate them away, that might happen.

(01:25:52):
But we absolutely still need to be investing in people's skills. I just don't think we need to be investing in them historically in the way that we always have. And I think in the future, we'll find that those ways actually seem quite inefficient, compared to what's possible today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:05):
That's such a powerful point. And we're already seeing this. I imagine you've seen these studies, I think it's in Nigeria, where they give students AI tutors, and they just zoom to the next, they accelerate so quickly in their progression of just reading and math.

(01:26:21):
I think we're already seeing it. And it's harder to measure in PM and product, and all these things, but in school, it's a lot easier to measure, and we're already seeing results there.

Hilary Gridley (01:26:28):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:29):
And to make this very real for people, you have this specific GPT, I think it's called Socrates, or what is called?

Hilary Gridley (01:26:34):
Oh, Aristotle, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:35):
Aristotle? Okay. No, we're going to edit that out. Aristotle, where it gives you scenarios in a product scenario.

Hilary Gridley (01:26:43):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:43):
Give an example, just to give people a sense of what this can do.

Hilary Gridley (01:26:46):
Yeah, so this came from, I was talking earlier about learning how to make a really strong, logical argument, or just a strong argument for your point of view, in general. And the sort of fundamental skill for that, in my view, is logical thinking, logical reasoning. And when I think about the best way, we have to test that today, at least ...

Hilary Gridley (01:27:00):
Think about the best way we have to test that today, at least the best is maybe not the right word, but the standard way we have to test that, the LSAT, the test that you take to get into law school, that is what that tests. And it sort of gives you these different scenarios and we'll try to say if a is true, then which of the following is true, is not true? Sort of testing some of these different logical relationships.

(01:27:26):
And so what I did was I made a GPT that I basically told it, "Create LSAT style questions to test logical reasoning, but put them in the scenarios of things that a PM would encounter." And I have a version of this that's very specific to WHOOP and working in consumer health, but you could do it for anything or you can just do generic, however you want to do it.

(01:27:49):
And actually it's kind of fun because it gives you the scenario and it's like, "The sales team is telling you that we need to invest in feature A and the, I don't know, the engineering team is telling you that we only have time to do feature B and the metrics are telling you that people who get this feature retain better." It just sort of gives you these little things and it's like, follow that logic, which is the logically best path from this? And it gives you a little multiple choice answer, you select one and it explains why you're right or wrong.

(01:28:29):
And so I think that's just another example of, you can't create those hyper personalized learnings, where I can make one that is literally so specific to you and your life, but is testing and training you on this broader skill set. And I think you can make things more fun that way, even in just the school context, in terms of doing that in a way that's just relevant to a person's interest, relevant to the things they care about. I think there's a ton of really interesting potential there too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:56):
So we're going to link to this GPT that you're talking about that people can try it out. And once you see it you're like, "Holy shit, I should just be doing this all the time," because you just get so many reps as a product builder.

Hilary Gridley (01:29:06):
And we were talking about a similar one with understanding engineering benchmarks. I don't have an engineering background, so this was really hard for me when I was moving into product, is just getting an instinct for what types of things tend to be easier or harder for engineering teams. And so we can have one similar that's saying, " Here's the scope that's being proposed. If you had to t-shirt size this, which one would you choose and why?" And you can say, "Oh, this sounds, small or whatever." And it'll say, "Oh actually these types of integrations tend to be complex for these reasons. So it's probably going to end up being more like a large."

(01:29:49):
And it doesn't have enough context to really inform you in the way that your tech stack at your company is. Although I guess could build it and give it that information and then it would, that would be cool. You should do that. But again, it's like you do that as a PM, you might get a chance to do that, I don't know, a couple times a week, maybe, maybe less often than that. And when you have this little tool, you can do it infinity times. You can spend an afternoon doing it. And so again, both the speed of those loops and the number of those loops that you're able to get is just radically different with AI compared to just when they come up in the course of your job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:33):
I think this is extremely cool. We're going to link to it. People should definitely play with this. Okay, I'm going to take us to two corners, recurring segments, of the podcast and then I want to talk about WHOOP before we get to a very exciting lightning round. So this is a new segment I'm trying out, I'm going to call it Pivotal Corner. And here's the question, what's the most pivotal moment in your career?

Hilary Gridley (01:30:54):
I mean I think it was at my former company, at Big Health, when my former boss left the company and I started reporting to the CEO. And again, I think it was my first time working with a CEO so closely, and it just, definitely trial by fire. But it made me understand so many things that seemed like they didn't make sense to me before, when I was just in the rank and file of a big tech company earlier in my career. You get in the room and you talk to these people and you're like, "Oh, this actually makes sense. I understand why this person has come to these conclusions."

(01:31:36):
And some of it's understanding the pressure they're under. Some of it's understanding, again, the way they view the world. But I think that was, to get to our earlier point around the humility of understanding that maybe this person is right about something that I don't see and maybe I can start by... If I start by giving them the benefit of the doubt, it is not only a nice thing to do, but it is also, it will help me understand why they're doing the things that they are. And I think I would've been so much less frustrated earlier in my career if I understood that instead of just being like, "Oh, this doesn't make any sense from where I'm sitting, so therefore it must not make any sense."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:13):
It's so cool that this connects back to your habit of doing this, having seen it, and being like, "Oh, I see, this is why..."

Hilary Gridley (01:32:20):
Yeah, I guess I hadn't realized.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:21):
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I could be wrong.

Hilary Gridley (01:32:23):
Well, I mean that's what it is. I feel like I've had so many of those times where I don't know, when I was growing up, I felt so confident in how I felt about everything. And then you get out there and you're just like, "Oh, I was missing some things." And after a while you're kind of like, "Okay, maybe I should approach these situations a little differently with the possibility that maybe I'm missing something."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):
So I actually asked your boss Kelvin, which is an awesome name by the way, Kelvin, about this moment. When I asked him what to ask you, and he brought this up actually, and here's the way, described it, "She may describe it as being thrown into the deep end or baptism by fire, but the reality is that she had the core skills and this was simply an opportunity for her to let those shine even more. She was an incredible first principles thinker, quick to tune the framing of problems as she learned more context. It's a great example of luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."

Hilary Gridley (01:33:17):
Thanks Kelvin. That's really nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:20):
He also said, "I wonder if she remembers how terrified she was now, because she absolutely knocked it out of the park and it felt like it was an inflection point that grew her confidence significantly."

Hilary Gridley (01:33:29):
Oh, I was terrified. Yeah. Big time terrified. And then, I mean this is also what I was saying about why it's so important to be regimented about having these things outside of work that allow you to continue to thrive, even in the face of just utter feelings of failure, of, "I am not doing a good job, this is not going well. I don't know what I'm doing." A lot of it was that time. Kelvin actually gave me some great advice that, this is maybe kind of scary advice, but when I asked him what his advice for me with the time was, and he said, "Product leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive."

(01:34:16):
And I think it's right. As I said, it is so often this feeling like there is not a clear right answer and not even necessarily a good answer. And everyone is looking to you for clarity and everyone is looking to you to make the right decisions and everyone sees the errors, or at least everyone can spot the flaws in whatever decision you make or whatever recommendation you make. And as I said, every path forward has flaws that can be poked in it. And so understanding that the existence of potential ways to be criticized about something does not warrant criticism in a way that can, I think often result in a lot of negative self-talk for people. So yeah, I mean it had a tremendous impact on me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:05):
It's interesting you have so much of these habits and skills you've built seem to, it's clear where they come from, from all these experiences that you had.

Hilary Gridley (01:35:12):
Well, and to the point of when you start talking to people and you start trying to build this mental model of how they think, that's exactly what you learn, is well, I can see how this person worked at this company at this time and I can see how this person had this kind of relationship with this other person. And all of these things shape the way that we approach problems and the way that we try to just move through the world. And it is understanding those types of things that allow you to understand how a person thinks.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
I wonder if you could ask ChatGPT to build, or Claude to build, these mental models. Like, "Here's their LinkedIn, here's their bio, here's a few things, how do they see the world?"

Hilary Gridley (01:35:49):
I will admit that I have tried this. And I think it's a great idea. I think it does help. I have not gotten to a point where I'm comfortable sharing it with other people, nor have I told anyone that I have tried to do this for them, but I've certainly done it for myself. And I think it would be helpful. Because you could say things, you could upload a doc or whatever and be like, "What are the three questions that this person's going to ask me about it?" And then you could be prepared for the questions that person's going to ask you and that's great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:23):
In this hypothetical example, what context do you share with this model to help it be good?

Hilary Gridley (01:36:30):
Great question. Hypothetically, I told you that I take all these notes on, here's what this person said and here's how I interpret it, and LLMs are really good at pattern matching and sort of spotting the... You could feed all of those in and just say, "Come up with the 10 criteria that this person is most likely to use to assess a possible recommendation or path forward," or, "Give me the top 10 ways that this person is likely to pick apart an argument or object to something," and you're going to get a good answer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:05):
More reason to build this habit of taking notes and sharing with your team. On the other hand, this might also be a good use case for Granola or something like that where you have all these meeting notes and you could just feed it, "Here's all the things Hilary said," and, "Oh, what is she probably going to say about this?"

Hilary Gridley (01:37:19):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:20):
Wow, so cool. Okay, next corner, I'm going to take us to Fail Corner. And in Fail Corner, the idea here is people come on this podcast, they share all these wins and success, everything's up and to the right and amazing, but in reality things don't always go that smoothly. So the question is, is there a story you could share of failure in your career where things didn't go the way you hoped and what you learned from that experience?

Hilary Gridley (01:37:45):
I mean I think the one that probably looms largest in my mind is, I mentioned this depression therapeutic that I spent about a year working on, and ultimately the company ended up acquiring a different depression therapeutic. And we kind of ended up merging the two of them. And a lot of the stuff that we had initially built that I had really loved about this product we were working on didn't really ever end up seeing the light of day beyond the kind of testing that we had done around it. And it was heartbreaking because I wish this product existed. I look at it and I'm like, "This was a great product and we put so much heart and soul into it."

(01:38:28):
And I think the lesson that I learned from that is, I think there's always a shot clock. When you're working, especially on a zero to one product, I think it can be very easy to feel like you have the luxury of time, of just like, we got to take the time to figure this out and get it right and that's what's most important. But the sort of build versus buy question is always live and it's always fair. And whether you want to admit it, if you're the one working on it, and you probably don't, I didn't want to admit this, there is a point at which it makes more sense for the company. If it is taking too long to develop something and there is a solution out there that works, it is the right decision to acquire that.

(01:39:15):
I mean I worked at Dropbox where I saw this happen all the time where we would acquire products that other teams internally had been working on and it's just like, it's heartbreaking when it happens. But I think there's an urgency that that has instilled in me that I think is actually really good and healthy, especially again working in this era where there is kind of this AI arms race and everyone's trying to move really quickly of, yeah, there's always a shot clock. And you might not be aware of it, but it's there, and you got to build your heart out and you got to ship and you got to get things out because at any time, that clock might run out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:39:49):
Speaking of shot clock, not necessarily, but I want to spend a little time on WHOOP, you guys just launched something that feels like a really big deal. I'm excited. That's the reason I got it. There's all these really cool new features. I think you call it WHOOP 5.0. What should people know? What's the newest, coolest thing that's happening with WHOOP?

Hilary Gridley (01:40:08):
Yeah, I'm really excited you got it. I know you tried it before and...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:11):
That's right. That's right.

Hilary Gridley (01:40:12):
People who have tried WHOOP in the past maybe felt like it was very focused on elite athletes and that is...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:18):
Yeah, that's exactly what I felt.

Hilary Gridley (01:40:22):
Sort of the lifeblood of the company. And I think what we've done with our new experience is we've really built something that can help everyone be healthier and live better. I would say we're no longer just for elite athletes. We're really now a health and performance companion for anybody who wants to feel their best.

(01:40:41):
For the first time in our company's history, we've updated our mission, so we're now saying that WHOOP exists to unlock human performance and health span. And health span I think is, and I mentioned earlier this feature I'm really excited about, because I do think it is kind of the most powerful version of a longevity-type feature I have seen because it is so focused on your behaviors and your habits today.

(01:41:06):
And we built it to be super, super actionable. So rather than just giving you a score that you're kind of like, "Okay, that's nice," if you start sleeping even 20 minutes more, 30 minutes more tonight, you're going to see how that changes your case of aging. You're going to see how that changes your WHOOP age. And I think that, as I mentioned earlier, I think is really rewarding.

(01:41:25):
We also have a lot of personalized coaching through our AI in terms of actions that you can take to improve your WHOOP age, to improve your sleep, to feel better, and it's all part of our broader aim to make health more actionable and accessible. I think one thing I'm really excited about is we have a bunch of new women's health features, so we have hormonal insights with improved menstrual cycle tracking. I'm actually pregnant and I-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:51):
What? I didn't know that. That's a big announcement. Wow. Congratulations Hilary. That's so exciting.

Hilary Gridley (01:42:00):
But actually part of how I found out I was pregnant was in seeing my WHOOP data.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:04):
What? What? That's insane.

Hilary Gridley (01:42:07):
In my WHOOP data, which is pretty remarkable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:08):
Wow.

Hilary Gridley (01:42:08):
And the way that we have this cycle tracking now, you can see the way that your different, your HRV, your resting heart rate, things like that, that's your heart rate variability and your resting heart rate, fluctuates throughout different times of your cycle. And even in the time leading up to that, I had a not straightforward pregnancy journey, and having these tools to really understand what was going on in my body was tremendously helpful and tremendously empowering for me and honestly really has changed my life. So I'm really excited about that.

(01:42:40):
We have a lot of great new heart health features. We have a heart health screener with blood pressure insights and ECG. That's really cool. We got a lot of great stuff cooking. So even if you tried WHOOP in the past and thought it wasn't for you, I think the new experience is a real upgrade and it's something that I'm deeply proud of having worked on and really excited to have out in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:03):
I am genuinely very excited about this. You could do, you said blood pressure and VO2 max?

Hilary Gridley (01:43:03):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:10):
And I know the battery is even longer too. There's just so much stuff.

Hilary Gridley (01:43:12):
Oh, we have a 14 day battery life. I didn't even say. We have these beautiful new leather bands which I love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:15):
Oh wow.

Hilary Gridley (01:43:17):
Okay. 14 day battery's life is insane. I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I don't even need to bring a charger. This is fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:25):
Oh man. This sounds like a WHOOP ad, but I'm very excited about this.

Hilary Gridley (01:43:28):
I'll say one more thing, which is we've opened a wait list for Advanced Labs and so pretty soon you're going to be able to have comprehensive lab work in the app, and I think we talk about the future of health, of having control of all of your health data in one place, and then being able to not just sort of find the signal in it and understand how your sleep is impacting your metabolic health or things like that. But again, get really actionable coaching on actions that you can take to feel better and be your healthiest and just pushing the limits of all the data that we're pulling into the WHOOP ecosystem. So really excited about that too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):
I'm hoping the WHOOP can actually take my blood and labs. Is that where this is going? Because that'd be so convenient.

Hilary Gridley (01:44:14):
No comment.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:15):
Okay. It'd be weird but also awesome. I don't have to go anywhere to do that. Hilary, we covered so much ground. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else that we haven't covered that you think, or last nugget you wanted to leave listeners with?

Hilary Gridley (01:44:29):
I don't think so. I feel like we covered everything

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:31):
We did. We covered so much. In the best way possible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Hilary Gridley (01:44:31):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:40):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Hilary Gridley (01:44:45):
Buddy, you can't call something a lightning round and then ask me about books. We could go for a whole other podcast where I'm like...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:53):
Let's recreate a time box for it.

Hilary Gridley (01:44:55):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:56):
Lightning round.

Hilary Gridley (01:44:57):
Okay, I'm going to, hearing what I'm going to say, I'm going to go full fiction on this. I'm going to say if you're going to read a book, don't bother reading a business book. Even the business books I love the most that shaped how I think I'm like, "I kind of got the gist of them part way through," but fiction, I'm like, everybody should read East of Eden by John Steinbeck and everybody should read The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway, which is my comfort book.

(01:45:22):
I think what I love about fiction is it teaches you how to sit inside tension. I think so much of working in product is, as I said, you're in this fog and you just have to provide clarity and you have to be really good at providing structure to ambiguous things and finding the way forward and to succeed at the job, you have to be able to do that. But I also think to succeed as a human in the job, you have to be able to sit in the mess and sit in the ambiguity. John Keats, the poet, talks about this concept of negative capability, which is the ability to remain in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason. And I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:04):
That sounds like a perfect quote for all PMs to...

Hilary Gridley (01:46:06):
Exactly. And you got to be both, right. Again, fiction, I love dualities. There's a lot of dualities in fiction, a lot of warring forces within people that can be so driving for people but can also be the source of so much anguish. I think it is important to live in both. In the, "I'm going to break down this problem, I'm going to structure it, I'm going to get out, but also I'm going to sit here and I'm going to accept that there is no right answer and there is no perfect answer." And that's life. You don't learn that from... To the extent that you learn that from a book at all, which maybe you don't, but I think you can learn it in fiction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:46):
I don't know how you feel about this book. I think you'll be proud of me. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.

Hilary Gridley (01:46:51):
Oh, literally that's the book that I'm bringing on vacation with me tomorrow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:54):
Wow. You've never read it?

Hilary Gridley (01:46:56):
I've never read it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:57):
Cool. Me neither. Okay, we'll exchange some notes. It's very long I'm realizing. Because I'm reading on the Kindle, and only 12%. Okay.

Hilary Gridley (01:47:07):
Now I really have to read it. I was kind of wavering. I was like, "Is this really what I'm going to want to read when I'm sitting by the pool?" But no, I've committed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:12):
You got to do it. Another guest recommended it and I saw it on some lists recently and then like, "Oh, I should read that." So yeah. Okay, great. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Hilary Gridley (01:47:24):
I've been watching The Rehearsal with Nathan Fielder. Have you seen this show?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:28):
I saw the first season. I've been a huge fan of Nathan Fielder for so long. I don't know if you saw his previous thing that he did, I forget what it's called.

Hilary Gridley (01:47:33):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:34):
Okay. He's so hilarious and such a genius.

Hilary Gridley (01:47:34):
Nathan for You.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:36):
Nathan for You? Oh my God. I haven't seen the new season, no.

Hilary Gridley (01:47:40):
The man is a freaking genius. Just when I thought that I had a good sense of all the human emotions that exist out there, I watch the show and I feel things that I'm like, I feel like 10 different things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:40):
Duality.

Hilary Gridley (01:47:55):
And I'm like, "I have no words for any of the things that I'm feeling right now." It's weird. It's weird stuff, but I'm enjoying it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:03):
I got to watch it. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoyed? Other than the WHOOP.

Hilary Gridley (01:48:08):
I love my Zwift. It's like a program that you can hook up a smart trainer to for an indoor cycling situation. And you kind of bike around like you're in Mario Kart and you're sort of in these virtual worlds biking with other people. It's I think for very serious cyclists, I'm not a very serious cyclist. For me, it's been amazing as somebody who actually really struggles to find time to exercise.

(01:48:33):
They have, speak of reward loops, they have one of the most amazing reward loops, which is you're biking along and you get into this track and a ghost of your previous self breaks out from you and starts racing alongside you at your personal best for that track. And you have to beat your personal self, or you have to beat this ghost version of yourself. And nothing has ever motivated me more in my life than past Hilary being like, "I'm coming for you." And I'm like... I don't get that competitive with other people, but past Hilary comes for me and I'm like, "This, I can't let happen." So I think it's a great product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:08):
I'm thinking about how to use that, I don't know, mode for other use cases, like the ghost version of something to motivate you essentially. Interesting.

Hilary Gridley (01:49:17):
I've been in so many product meetings where I'm like, "Can we make a ghost version of yourself?" [inaudible 01:49:21]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:20):
Yeah. They're like, "Shut up about the ghost." Okay, amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?

Hilary Gridley (01:49:33):
I'll say one that's been top of mind for me recently, because I was talking about the high brow fiction. I also have to go low brow. I saw this clip of Beavis and Butthead online recently where they were watching a music video for Creep by Radiohead. And it starts off really slow and one of them, I think maybe Butthead, is like, "Oh, this sucks." And then the chorus comes and it starts getting all hyped and they're like, "Oh, this rocks, this rocks." And then, I'm not going to do my Beavis and Butthead impression. So then it gets back to the slow part and they're like, "Oh wait, this sucks again." And then Butthead is like, "Why don't they just play the cool part the entire time?" And Beavis is like, "Because if they didn't have the part of the song that sucked, the cool part wouldn't be as cool."

(01:50:20):
And I was like, "That is so profound." That is what life is all about, is just if it didn't have the parts that sucked, the cool parts wouldn't be as cool. And we're always chasing the cool parts. We want it all to be the cool parts, but it can't. So thank you Beavis and Butthead.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:36):
Thank you Beavis and Butthead. Okay, final question. I love that you're talking about fiction books. This is where my question was going to go. What's a fiction book that most impacted your product building approach or career or the way you think about product?

Hilary Gridley (01:50:52):
Can I give a poem?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:54):
Absolutely. Even better. Poem, extra credit.

Hilary Gridley (01:50:58):
There's a poem by Derek Walcott about, it's called Sea Grapes, and it's about Odysseus, and he talks about Odysseus being driven by the ancient war between obsession and responsibility. And I read that line when I was 18 years old and it has always stuck with me. And I sort of mentioned earlier, I think about these dualities that drive us. And I think as a product person, I always feel like I'm living between these two, the obsession and the responsibility. I want to go so deep on this and I want to spend as much time as I possibly can just sorting every little piece out.

(01:51:48):
But we live in a society, we exist in a business. I am trying to create value for shareholders and trying to bring these two things together, I feel like a, has been the kind of defining struggle of my career, I think of many people's careers, is how you have something that you feel like you can really obsess over and have that flow over, or have that flow when you're working on. But then it's got to kind of work in this broader system as well. And I think that's sort of been the thing that I think of as the guiding post for what I want to do with my career and with my life. So I think it's got to be Derek Walcott.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:30):
What a beautiful way to end it. Hilary, two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on stuff that you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Hilary Gridley (01:52:39):
Great, thank you. So as I mentioned, I have a newsletter, it's hils.substack.com. That's hils.substack.com. I'm also teaching a Maven class on being a super manager with AI. So if you were listening to all this and you were like, "Oh Hilary, that sounds so great, but I don't have time for any of that. How do you have time for all that?" Honestly, hyper-leveraging myself with AI has been a big part of how I find time to do any of this stuff. And so I share a bunch about how I do that, how I use AI as a manager, building on a lot of the stuff that I shared on Claire's podcast as well, How I AI. So you can find me on Maven there. We've got a couple of cohorts coming up.

(01:53:23):
And then, yeah, I encourage everyone to try out WHOOP, you can get a free month on me at join.whoop.com/hilary, that's Hilary with one L. And you can post at me or tweet at me on X and let me know what you think of it. And I would love everyone's feedback because we're really excited about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:44):
As you were talking, I looked up your course just for make sure people can find it. So you go to maven.com, you just search for Hilary Gridley and you'll find it.

Hilary Gridley (01:53:50):
Yep. And you can also, I realize that if you Google super manager, you will find me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:54):
Whoa.

Hilary Gridley (01:53:54):
So that is my new claim to fame.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:00):
Oh my God, that's so great. 4.9 stars. Holy moly. There we go. Okay, Hilary, thank you so much. This was incredible. Covered everything I was hoping to, this was everything I wanted it to be. Thank you so much for being here.

# What it takes to become a top 1% PM | Ian McAllister (Uber, Amazon, Airbnb)

## Transcript

Ian McAllister (00:00:00):
If you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion, or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light.

Lenny (00:00:22):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Ian McAllister. Ian is the author of one of the most classic posts on product management, What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM, amongst many other pieces of writing that he shared online. Ian has managed over 100 product managers in his career. He spent 12 years at Amazon where he built Amazon Smile and led the team responsible for growing Alexa internationally. He also worked at Airbnb with me and now he's at Uber leading global product for the vehicles platform, which includes making Uber's fleet increasingly electric and autonomous. In our conversation, we focus primarily on two topics. What separates a top 1% PM from everyone else, specifically for new PMs and also for senior PMs. And we also dig deep into the working backwards process. We get into how you can implement the process on your team and how you might be doing it wrong. There's also a bunch of links to templates and guides in the show notes, so if you want to follow along, definitely check those out. With that, I bring you Ian McAllister.

Lenny (00:02:24):
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Lex Friedman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies and internal testing that they do.

Lenny (00:03:13):
And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. To take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:03:55):
Ian, welcome to the podcast.

Ian McAllister (00:03:57):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I've been looking forward to this.

Lenny (00:03:59):
Me too. I'm sure you hear this a lot, but when I was a new product manager, a very new PM, the post that you wrote on what makes a top 1% product manager was really influential and really helped me figure out what to focus on and what skills are really important. And I find that it continues to live on as this very legendary post for product managers who are trying to figure out what to do. And I just reread it in prep for this post and I was just like, wow, this is ... Now that I'm on the other side, I'm like, this is so right. And so I'm really excited to dig into a lot of these things in person, virtually in person, and with you. So thank you again for doing this.

Ian McAllister (00:04:35):
Yeah. Man, it's awesome. I'm excited just to spend some time talking with you about product and we'll see what happens.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Did you expect the impact that this post had when you were writing it, when you were just putting this together, the impact that the post had in your career or just the PM industry?

Ian McAllister (00:04:51):
Definitely not. I used to lurk on Quora at the time and then I was just having fun reading things and answering some questions and I used to look for questions in the Goldilocks zone. They weren't too high level of abstract like how do you be a good problem, but they weren't too super specific and this one was kind of right in the middle. And so I'd pluck off a couple of those and I think more as a way to structure my own thoughts, that was what was interesting and fun for me to do that. Not because I thought it'd have any kind of real reach. But obviously it's been cool to see that people reference it pretty often and that's been pretty fun.

Lenny (00:05:23):
We'll link to this in the show notes. If folks that are listening don't know what we're talking about, we'll link to it and you can check it all out. And we're going to be talking about a lot of this stuff in the actual chat, but there's a couple things there that are worth maybe drilling in on a little bit. One is just the impact that writing on the internet can have on someone's career. This one post I imagine had a lot of impact on the trajectory of your career. Is there something you could share there? Is that true?

Ian McAllister (00:05:45):
Yeah, it did. And there's another post, I think it was before this one, someone just asked about Amazon's product development process and so I wrote about the working backwards process. Which isn't my process. I just used it and just described it and just kind of caught on a little bit there as well. I think those two, and then I started to write more about people management and product management. And I think the value for me was so awesome just to make connections with people in the industry and it felt like this is, I guess, the 2010 or something like this where a lot of Amazon people I of thought were just so 100% heads down. It was a little bit of a secretive culture, not maybe like Apple, but it was pretty private. But I was interested in the startup community and product in general and so I think I spent a little time trying to engage with folks and I just made so many great connections and relationships from this.

Ian McAllister (00:06:39):
I remember interacting with you and getting to know Joebot and other folks at Airbnb early on even before I joined. But obviously I'd credit this work and those relationships for me ultimately going there and so many great relationships and people I've met because of it. And aside from just the little positive feedback, I mean people tweet at me periodically, be like, "Hey, by the way, just love this post," and whatever. And so it's super gratifying.

Lenny (00:07:03):
You mentioned a little bit about your background and we're about to get into that and I want you to share all the things you've done. But the other piece there that I think is interesting that comes up again and again in the power of writing is it often just starts with you trying to collect your thoughts and putting it out there and ends up, wow, so many people find that valuable and it spreads. And so that's just a really simple way of thinking about if you're starting to write online, just summarize something that you've been thinking about that you want to just crystallize in your own head. There's this quote that's probably falsely attributed to Mark Twain and Hemingway often of just like, I don't know what I've thought until I've written it down. And that's super true with these things and so that's a good example of this.

Ian McAllister (00:07:42):
And I think with any kind of writing, it was probably less structured initially, but I would, partially because I was trying to share something for an external audience, try to just organize it and make it compact and not too wordy or rambling. And I think business writing, I spent a lot of that time doing that at Amazon, is so valuable because you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things. So I found it's pretty valuable in kind of sharpening your ax.

Lenny (00:08:15):
So these are the two things we're going to focus our chat on is what makes a top 1% product manager and then the Amazon way of working and especially working backwards. So these are all good cues for where we're going. But before we get there, can you just spend just a minute giving us a sense of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?

Ian McAllister (00:08:31):
Well, I can tell you what I have done. I'll let others decide what's wonderful or not. So after doing finance and economics in school, I made the logical choice and I got a job doing marketing in the beer industry and then the next logical choice, I moved to Tokyo and I bootstrapped my way into software development without knowing Japanese or software development. Did that for a few years, came back to the states working as a developer at a startup and then kind of a midsize company and then moved to Microsoft as a program manager, pretty much a product manager. The same thing there in that role. Learned some good stuff and then made a connection with Amazon and moved there 2006. And that was really the start of when I think about building my product toolbox and leadership toolbox. So few different things I did over 12 years, a few years in retail and conversion.

Ian McAllister (00:09:22):
I then moved in traffic and direct traffic loyalty when I created Amazon Smile. The role in Alexa. I led Alexa International, so scaling Alexa and Echo to six more countries. And the last role in delivery experience and operations. So I led a number of different programs there and then recently joined Uber where I'm a senior director of product and tech for vehicles. So that means everything, all the tools that help fleets and rental companies make their vehicles accessible to Uber drivers so they can earn. Sustainability tech and electrification, our vehicle platform, and then creating a path for autonomous vehicles to come onto the platform. And that's it.

Lenny (00:10:03):
Amazing. I just realized this one thread through your career is autonomy and AI a little bit, right? With Alexa and then with Uber, with these autonomous cars stuff you're working on now. Is that something realized or is that an accident?

Ian McAllister (00:10:18):
Well, I mean I guess you could connect those things. Obviously both are machine learning, AI. The way I think about it is that I've done a whole bunch of different lifetimes, especially around eCommerce, and so it allows me to cover the gamut. Plus, I guess I forgot to mention the time at Airbnb working with Joebot and you and Vlad and Dan and Shirley and there was focused on building out the customer support technology platform. So that's another part of the eCommerce platform. Covers the gamut.

Lenny (00:10:45):
I forgot to bring that up too. I'm glad you touched on that.

Ian McAllister (00:10:48):
I don't know how I missed that. I guess I skipped past that with the Amazon stuff.

Lenny (00:10:50):
The most transformative time getting to work together.

Ian McAllister (00:10:53):
That was awesome. That was awesome. I learned a lot from you too during that time.

Lenny (00:10:56):
What a time. This is a good time to chat about, speaking of Airbnb and all that, to chat about what makes a top 1% product manager. So I know your post was really titled what separates a 1% PM from a 10% PM, but it feels like it's even broader, just like how do you become a top 1% product manager. And I thought maybe a good way to start here is maybe just run through the attributes that you've found over the years or here's the things that a top 1% PM needs to get great at. Maybe just run through them and then we'll talk through them in a little more detail.

Ian McAllister (00:11:28):
Yeah, I was going to pull up my post here so I could actually refer to it. Do you want me to go through all of them or just pick out a couple to touch on?

Lenny (00:11:33):
Let's maybe just go through them quickly just to put them out there and then I'll have some follow up questions to dig into a few of them.

Ian McAllister (00:11:40):
All right, sounds good. Well, the way I listed it at the time, think big. Always want to hunt for bigger impact. Communicate, I think we'll probably touch on that a little bit. It's super important for PMs as a test of their thinking and their communication. Simplify. How you can do more with less and have more impact. Simplifying is a great way to do that. Prioritize. That's I think the core skill after communication of a PM and there's so many different lenses to view that. Let's see here. Forecasting and measuring. I think that it's really important. What separates product managers from consultants sometimes is you forecast and then you execute and then you measure and validate and that helps you build your instincts. Just obviously the core execution of just shipping and doing what you said you do. Understanding technical trade offs is that you don't have to be a software engineer to be a great PM, but the more you learn about technical trade offs, not just product and customer trade offs, that will help you simplify and get more yield out of your resources.

Ian McAllister (00:12:40):
Understanding good design. If you're working on anything customer focused, that's always going to help you think in the mind of a customer or user. You don't need to design, but the more you understand helps. Writing effective copy. This goes a long way not to get close and not to sub out the copy to somebody else, but to get good at communicating with a couple words to your customers. That's a great skill. Those were the ones that I wrote at the time, I guess 10 years ago, and then I refreshed the post recently in my newsletter. And I added a couple new ones honestly, because as I reflected back, there was a few that I think a lot about these days that I missed the first time around. Earn trust with others. That's so important as a PM, but especially if you're going to grow as a product leader becomes even more important.

Ian McAllister (00:13:29):
And I think trust is the currency of a product manager and a product leader, especially if you're going to grow in your career. Digging for data. It's out there and you got to develop the tools to go find it. Not to depend on your analyst or what's in the reports today. So that's a really important skill for anyone in product. And probably the more junior you are, the more important it is as you're really in the weeds there building product. Pushing back effectively. This is an art and a skill, but I think your ability to do this is pretty correlated with your ability to grow and succeed as a leader. Because if you say yes to everything, you're going to go nowhere. Adapting to change. How you react to change will obviously impact one, your mood and your morale, as well as how effectively you can rally yourself, your team. And then driven by impact, not promotion. Ultimately that's what you want to wake up every day thinking about how to have an impact for your business and that will be an indicator on your likelihood of promotion. So do that instead of just focusing on how to get promoted and having that guide your day.

Lenny (00:14:33):
Awesome. So it's a long list. There's a lot that a PM needs to be good at, which I think if you're a PM you already know. It's a wild, crazy, impossible job to have everything nailed down. And at the end of this post even mention you've never met a 1% PM that does all these things. And I think that's important. No one's going to be the best at all these things. And so just to drill down a little bit and get a little more focused. Say you're a new product manager. Of these, I forget how many there, maybe 10, 12, what are the top three that you think new PMs should get most good at and focus on?

Ian McAllister (00:15:06):
Probably communicate, prioritize, and execute. I think those are just the core building blocks. Other ones will be more important as you grow and become more senior, but those ones, no matter where you are in your product career I think are super important. Being a better communicator is something I've been working on my entire product career and I'll be working on until the day I stop. And I remember years ago I was at Microsoft, my first effectively product manager role and my product unit manager, Thomas, came by the office and I think he asked me, "When is this going to ship?" And I was like, "Well, this thing is taking a little bit longer here and this other thing and yada yada." And I gave a bunch of background, but I didn't really answer the question. And I got a little feedback from him like, that's not really the ... Ultimately he's waiting for a date.

Ian McAllister (00:15:53):
And so I just reflected on that and that was, as I remember, my journey to try to be a better communicator over time and I'm still on it. When I went to Amazon, I worked for Kim Rackmiller who was our, I think at the time, SVP for Worldwide Discovery. And I think she was Amazon's first TPM. And she was tough but super smart. And so that was also an early experience to learn from her. And sometimes you get some feedback when you didn't really answer the question. And my first boss, Russell and I organized and started to gather this thing called the Book of Kim. And so we would gather these best practices that we learned from her elsewhere. Avoid weasel words, answer first and then explain, own your problems. And started building this.

Ian McAllister (00:16:36):
And then I extended that over time and added a bunch more and wrote a post called the Operators Manual. I tried to gather all these things together. But it's such an important thing and the stakes get higher as you work with more and more senior people. But if you can get in the habit early of answering a when question with a date, knowing how to use numbers to answer questions and honestly just learning from feedback and grade yourself after you get feedback on a doc or after a meeting or after answering a question in an elevator. And if you try to say, "Gosh, how could I have done that better?," and then try to get better, you can. And you can go far if you just focus on that and all the other 150 skills of a product manager, but if you don't have that, it's unlikely that you're going to really go too far in your product career.

Ian McAllister (00:17:24):
So that was communicate. I guess prioritize as the next one. And so I think this is the number one key tool of a product manager is prioritization. Because so many things come from being good at prioritizing. And it's not just what project do you do next or do you do this project or that project. There's so many different dimensions to prioritization. There's which themes are you going to prioritize in a roadmap and which projects within a theme and how are you going to sequence those projects, how much of a project you're going to build. And also just time management is also a prioritization function. Like what are you going to choose to spend your time on? Which things are you going to really go all out to make great and which things are you going to starve for attention or just not do? Given the same amount of skill intelligence and resources, a product manager with a great innate ability to prioritize is going to generate 5X the impact of someone without that skill.

Ian McAllister (00:18:18):
My early, if you could call it success at Amazon, I think was completely dependent. It wasn't because I worked smarter or I was smarter, I worked longer hours or I was more technical than other people. I think it was just because I was one, super hungry for impact. And if there was a number or a metric that measured success at the business I was running, I wanted that to go up and to the right. Not to hit a goal, but just to go as far and as fast up to the right as possible. And if anything, it was just working with a team to hone in on the projects that would do that with the greatest leverage and just marshaling all the team's resources. So that was a good start. That was a fit with Amazon in terms of working backwards from a fitness function or a metric.

Ian McAllister (00:19:01):
And so did that with the first team I was there and then again later managed the gifting business. And so it just was one skill that I think helped me as well as make up for maybe some deficiencies I'd had. I don't have the biggest brain in the world and I don't have the biggest working memory and I wasn't the most technical, but by trying to really get good at that prioritization, I think that's helped me and it still does.

Ian McAllister (00:19:23):
I think execute is the third one, which is no surprise that every PM has to execute. And I think assuming you prioritize well then execution means sort of molding what you want to build into a simple compact package that has the highest impact possible. And then also execution's a big function of the team you're working with. So it's your designers and your data science folks, and especially your engineers.

Ian McAllister (00:19:47):
So anything to do with how well they're doing their jobs or how well they're resourced or whether they're getting better and better at every sprint, you have some amount of ownership in helping make that happen because that directly impacts your team's ability to execute and ultimately your reputation as well for being able to execute. The drive that goes into execution, product managers are the mode of power behind execution and impact. And if you stall out or you don't do your job, the project's probably going to stall out as well. And so you're the ones, especially with a TPM, if you're lucky enough to have one in the back of the ship, kind of beating the drum and driving everyone forward. But again, lots of people have written a lot of stuff about execution and there's a lot to it, but I think those are probably the three I'd focus on.

Lenny (00:20:32):
Awesome. And what's interesting about these three is if you look at the rest of the list, think big, understand technical trade offs, understand good design, I think what I would take away from this is those are the things you don't need to focus on that much when you're a new PM. Focus on, as you said, communication, prioritizing, executing. Focus less on these other things because later they'll become more and more important and obviously learn as much as you can, but it's almost bit easier to think about the things you don't need to stress about when you're starting out.

Ian McAllister (00:21:02):
Yeah, I think that makes sense. If there's a core or think about in year one as a PM, focusing on those things. And you can develop other skills over time. But yeah, I think you're spot on there.

Lenny (00:21:14):
If we were to go back through these three, just maybe as a last question, and you may not have an answer to this, but if you think about communicating, prioritizing, and executing, is there one tactical thing you could suggest that a PM listening to this can do to get better at one of these things? Is there a trick you've learned of, wow, this is one way you could level up communicating, executing, prioritizing or not?

Ian McAllister (00:21:37):
The closest thing to a checklist, the post I mentioned, the Operator's Manual, that was the closest thing to, if you do these things, these specific actions, I think it'll go a long way. Because a lot of them are guided around not doing the easy pitfalls and communication mistakes like rambling. If you're asked a question and you explain and then maybe you get to the answer, if you just think, answer and then explain or sometimes answer and then shut up, that actually is a tactical thing you can do to get better at communicating. And there's some other tips in there as well. So that was my attempt to try to encode, to take some of the ones that we gathered early at Amazon, add some more. The others are ... Yeah. There's no just simple trick unfortunately to prioritize other than ... I mean I think working backwards is a good technique to have impact to guide your prioritization. And that is something where it's not a simple tip, but there's a set of practices and behaviors that you can do that will ultimately lead you to prioritize better.

Lenny (00:22:39):
Awesome. We'll talk about all that.

Ian McAllister (00:22:40):
And then I think communication, the simple tip was just grade yourself after you communicate and try to just take a moment and after a while you'll just do it naturally to think about, "Gosh, how would I have answered that question better?" And so the next time you could try to answer that question better and it's just a continuous improvement process.

Lenny (00:22:58):
Or maybe even ask your manager, "Hey, what could I have done better in terms of how I communicated in that last meeting or that last email?"

Ian McAllister (00:23:04):
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:23:06):
Okay, so then coming at it from the other direction, say you're a senior PM, what are three of these attributes that you would suggest folks focus on to get better and level up in their career?

Ian McAllister (00:23:17):
Gosh, it's still communicate, to be honest. I think that's the one at every level of product, just the stakes are higher. I think think big is one for sure. There was a phrase I think Warren Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway letter used at some point. Was at our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big? So that's a tool and that's often where I'd start when my PMs were sharing an idea is I'd try to expand it to the degree it might be expanded, think about it from that perspective and then maybe you want to still start small, but with a bigger vision in mind.

Ian McAllister (00:24:04):
Earn trust is a huge one and that's kind of why I added it more recently. And it becomes even more important as you get into senior roles because I think it's truly the currency of a product leader or probably any leader in any function. Because if you want to ask for more resources to do something bigger, if your leadership doesn't trust you to use those resources well or do what you said you're going to do, you're probably not going to get them. But if you've built trust that you're a good steward of resources and you make a lot of impact with a given team, that's directly going to correlate with your ability to gain more resources. Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a FM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it.

Ian McAllister (00:24:54):
And if you do that repeatedly, you're going to be in pretty good shape. And there's so many practices as a product manager or product leader that build trust. You tell the truth without fail. And you launch when you say you'd launch and you launch what you said you'd launch and you own your mistakes. And then the other practices just lose trust. If you lie or if you're evasive, if you don't ship what you said you're going to do, if you ignore your mistakes or you repeat them. And so I think just simply having high standards for yourself and think of trust as that currency, that's going to correlate well as a PM, as a GPM or director of product in any level, that's the thing that you want to build.

Lenny (00:25:34):
So thinking big, building trust. Was there a third?

Ian McAllister (00:25:37):
I think maybe the last one, which is certainly relevant for a PM but is really true as well, is driven by impact. And if you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, which will influence how you build your roadmap and how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light. And I remember in my first 10 years at Amazon, just naturally not because I thought about it, I was just hungry to have an impact. Take my business, grow it as fast as possible. I wasn't maybe loosely thinking about promotion, but I wasn't thinking about it. I never talked to my manager about it and I wasn't bringing it up. I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger. And then the net result was I was promoted several times and I did grow in my role, but that wasn't what drove me. It was just the impact.

Lenny (00:26:38):
Would you say that driving impact is more important for a new PM or senior PM? It feels like impact is the soup within which all PMs swim and that's constantly important, but it's interesting that you mostly put that into the latter part of a career. Do you feel like with new PMs on your team you're less expecting them to think about impact and focus on impact?

Ian McAllister (00:27:01):
Well, I mean I think for junior PMs, if you're a brand new PM, then yeah, you want to have an impact, but you're really just ... You have a project or a feature to ship or something like that and you're often not necessarily given a lot of latitude to build your own roadmap. But you're asked to ship this. So you want to spec it, you want to execute and do it. But increasingly as you grow, there are opportunities to sense out and try to have a bigger impact maybe and then start to influence prioritization or roadmaps. It's just that the expectations, it goes from being a nice to have as a junior or first time PM to as you get a little more senior, hopefully if things work the way they should work, that's really how you're evaluated. Yes, you want to treat your team well and you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but take two people, one has a massive impact on the business and one who doesn't, then the right way to work should be that first person should be the one that grows and develops and is tasked and with bigger challenges just because if you're impactful at a bigger challenge, that's even more important for the business. So I think that's a good way to think about the flywheel of product leadership.

Lenny (00:28:11):
It feels like a lot of times you get lucky as a new PM. You work on a project that ends up having a lot of impact that you didn't necessarily drive. You just happen to work on something that, wow, this was a huge deal and that feels like an important thing to optimize for a little in your early career is work on something that's likely to have a lot of impact even if you're not responsible for setting the strategy and prioritizing.

Ian McAllister (00:28:29):
Well, I think that's true if you have a choice in where you work in product. If you have a choice to work on something that's part of offense, something that drives the business. And it's true that executives wake up if something drives dollars or customers or offense things and it just maybe shouldn't be this way, but a little less interested in things that maybe less than a risk that just the risk never happens, it comes to pass or a cost center that operates a little more efficiently. So that it's one lens where that might relate to your success. I think also who you work for. And I think most of us don't get to choose that especially early in our career. It either works out in your favor and which is great and that was the case for me, especially at Amazon, some of the leaders I worked with. But sometimes it doesn't. But I think the more that you can suss out who you work for because then the better they are at these skills and prioritizing, one, they're just going to be a better teacher and a better role model to learn from. So I think that's an important thing to think about in any kind of job change.

Lenny (00:29:30):
To close the loop on this piece for more senior PMs, the skills to focus on, you said, thinking big, building trust and driving impact. I'll put you on the spot. I'll give you two options, two directions to go with this. One is if you want to get better at each of these three things, do you have any one thing someone could do or what does great look like for thinking big or building trust or driving impact? Those are two options.

Ian McAllister (00:29:58):
That was six questions there Lenny. Let me see here what I'm answering. Well, I think the think big one is interesting and one way to think about thinking big, especially as you grow in your career is most people operate within a box. There's a box of there's product management and these are the things that product managers do. And you basically build a roadmap and you prioritize features and you work with eng. And so that might be the typical kind of product scope and tech. Most of my roles were ones where I was kind of a GM but a really product focused GM and so I naturally found myself taking a much wider view of what product is across disciplines. And I was lucky enough that I had engineering teams and marketers and analysts and other folks and so that helped me. But I think as a PM you can still do that, even if those functions don't report to you, is take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech.

Ian McAllister (00:30:58):
It's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success or anything else. And it just means, you don't own marketing or you don't own this other function, but you own it until you find somebody else to own it. And so that's not necessarily thinking big in terms of scale or whatever, but in terms of how you think about your role as a PM and what your ownership responsibility is. And so I think just the more that you ... You don't want to get over your skis as a PM and then you're trying to change your CFO's mind about something necessarily. But the more you grow, that you have to increasingly do that and find the constraints or barriers to your success or your product success and knock them down no matter what they are.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Yeah. It makes me think about just the advice of think like an owner, think beyond just your one little bubble, think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on. So that's great advice.

Lenny (00:33:08):
Before we move on to the working backwards piece, which I'm excited to get into, is there anything else you want to share on this thread?

Ian McAllister (00:33:15):
I might just talk about earn trust because this is one that I didn't put in there initially and I honestly don't think that I recognized the importance of it early on in my career or even in the middle of my career and it's been in the last couple years that I really understood the importance of it. My wife Sarah is a product manager in AWS and so as I've mentored her a little bit in her career and I've seen how this is really a superpower for her, it really made me reflect like, what are the things I could have done better in different roles to earn trust more? And it's not just the basic things like to be honest and tell two different people the same thing versus different things. I think it's trying to really understand, work backwards from that person and what are their goals and what are their organization's goals and honestly spend the time and the energy to try to get to alignment in the same place.

Ian McAllister (00:34:09):
And be willing, not just bullheaded, which I might have been earlier in my career, maybe still to many people, but charging forth what do I think's right but taking some more time to try to forge an alliance with someone because if you do that you're ultimately going to be more successful. So that was just one that I was probably slow to recognize the importance of and I'm trying to catch up now.

Lenny (00:34:30):
Is there a story that comes to mind where you look back and I should have earned trust there or I broke some trust here that you'd be willing to share?

Ian McAllister (00:34:39):
When I was working with you and the team at Airbnb, I think this is one where Joebot brought me on to help build out the customer support technology platform maybe more how Amazon would do it. To maintain a high level of quality but to become more efficient as well and to reduce the cost so that Airbnb wouldn't have to scale customer support this to the same degree the business was scaling. And so trying to build a new team and develop and I was pretty heads down doing it the way I thought it should be done and working with the team there in terms of let's get a strong analytics framework. Let's measure all these things and really understand what's going on at the data level and then let's use the same prioritization muscles that had made me successful at Amazon to prioritize things that were best worked backwards.

Ian McAllister (00:35:26):
And I think that what I didn't do as much as I should have is obviously really partnering with the customer support leadership team as well. That was something where I think in some ways it felt like we were in alignment and getting on stage together and stuff, but it turned out I maybe hadn't spent as much time and effort on that as I thought to build that true support there such that that leader would rally the organization around it as well and we'd be marching in the same beat. And so that was something that I would reflect. Now, I think the team did amazing things and Shirley really carrying the torch there in the entire team and so accomplished a lot. But that was a learning about ... Going back, I probably would've spent more time and really tried to do even more on that.

Lenny (00:36:12):
Thanks for sharing that. I never knew that story. And it sounds like the takeaway there is maybe don't take for granted the leadership team, the team that'll actually be using the product. Is that a roughly way to think about it?

Ian McAllister (00:36:23):
Well I would say that if you have a certain approach you may be believe it's the right one and it may be the right one, but if you don't build the support and the relationships that they're going to help carry that out and execute on that strategy, it may not get executed as well as you think it should be. And so that's an important part of success. It's a risk that you have to mitigate. And trying to earn trust and to do it that way is a way to mitigate that risk that the right product and the right direction and the right strategy, it may not land if you don't have that support that you need. And so that I think was my learning.

Lenny (00:37:00):
What better way to learn a lesson than get some wrong and then you never forget it again.

Ian McAllister (00:37:06):
You could call it getting wrong. Just think of something I could have done better. And just that same continuous improvement mindset. It's to everything, every role, every experience, every project, every communication. And if you build that muscle to try to do it better the next time and also just the try to be a little self aware about what could have gone better, then I think it's a really good muscle to build.

Lenny (00:37:27):
This is a good segue to the second area of where our chat is going to go, which is Amazon and things you've learned about just the working backwards process. How many years did you say you worked at Amazon total?

Ian McAllister (00:37:38):
12 years.

Lenny (00:37:39):
12 years. It feels like everyone that worked at Amazon is 10 years or more. It's these large numbers. So they must be doing something right and I don't know. What do you think that is actually? Why do people stay there so long? It's amazing.

Ian McAllister (00:37:52):
What's interesting about Amazon, and it's changed over time, is that I think pretty quickly whether you're a fit for it or not. And it can be kind of a crucible and a little spartan. And it just clicked with me though because I'm kind of a structured thinker and right brain. And so this idea that hey, I could have this business and then figure out one metric or fitness function that determines success and then my job is to make that number go up and to the right. That kind of fit with me. And then I rewired my brain probably over the first 10 years around this concept and I just felt like I was learning, I was not only working with smart people that were driven, which was true at Microsoft as well, but there was kind of this DNA in the organization and this wiring that I thought was really effective and it just kind of clicked with me.

Ian McAllister (00:38:44):
And so I molded myself to the environment and at every step of the way I felt like I was learning and growing and one of the benefits for me is you get a chance to learn from so many other people in these different settings. You get the chance to read documents that make you learn more so than probably a slide deck. You get a chance to be in weekly business reviews with really smart people and learn from that. Not just learn from your own experience but from everyone else in that room. So I was just a sponge and so much learning happening that I think propelled my career. And so that was why, especially the first 10 years, that it was so fantastic of just growing and feeling yourself build these new muscles and develop these new tools and I loved it. So that was why I stayed so long and obviously Airbnb then, it was the time to try something new, which was a great experience and kind of a test. I was in Seattle and the company was in San Francisco and spending three days on a road each week was a good learning and ultimately a reason to come back and be Seattle based. But then I chose Amazon again because it was still a great place and I thought I could continue to learn.

Lenny (00:39:52):
Awesome. I was going to mention they drew you back in. So yeah, that's pretty rare. What did you learn from folks like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilke about building product leadership, company building? What's stuck with you working with folks like?

Ian McAllister (00:40:04):
I would say two very different people but complimented themselves so well. I didn't have hundreds of meetings with Jeff Bezos while I was there, but I did have a chance, especially in the development of Amazon Smile and then early when I started the social team to have some of those meetings where I wrote the doc and it was Jeff and 10 other people reviewing. The process of doing, even before hitting on Amazon Smile, it was really kind of a innovation process I guess you could call it, where we had a goal in mind to increase customers' loyalty to Amazon, their direct traffic loyalty, not in the way Prime did, which is a paid program, but to try to come up with another program or way in which customers might start their shopping on Amazon instead of elsewhere. And so I was running the gifting business. I moved over to the traffic org to try to come up with a new program with no team or anything.

Ian McAllister (00:40:58):
And then I would meet with Jeff Bezos and Wilke and others every couple months and I would profile a couple different options and use the working backwards process and we'd review some facts. And so there was a bunch of learnings throughout that process. One, I found Jeff to be super encouraging. And each time we'd leave one of those meetings, we maybe didn't find the thing in that meeting. We'd talk about it and brainstorm a little bit, but he would always leave and be encouraging and with a quote. One time he was like, "Remember, this process doesn't have to be efficient because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going." And then he'd leave the room and whatever. So I found the rhetoric around Jeff or blowing up or whatever, I didn't find any of that and I found him to be super encouraging and he found all these times to help train me in the working backwards process.

Ian McAllister (00:41:52):
There was a time when I came with a press release for a concept and it didn't have a problem paragraph. I'd skipped that. And he reviewed it and so forth and he was like, "You know what, maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem." And so it was kind of a little lesson to me like, "Yeah, maybe that is why I did it. I wasn't really working backwards, I kind of had the solution in mind and so I'd skipped over that part." So that was one just very specific learning about the process from Jeff. So Jeff Wilke, I probably learned more from Wilke just because I had more exposure over my time there. At one point he was my skip level. And I have such tremendous respect for Wilke or Jaw as he was called internally because he was sort of the consummate operator.

Ian McAllister (00:42:34):
This muscle that I think you learn working at Amazon about being an operator, whether you're ... You're not in operations, but any part of the business that I think came from him. And I think it was due to him that Amazon developed that muscle. And I think it's one way that separates some Amazon PMs from people who haven't worked there in that environment and that continuous improvement mindset. That's so important. And one of the forums that was a great learning was the WBR or Weekly Business Review. Or later called Consumer Business Review. So this was a forum where Jeff would lead the meeting. It would be a series of metrics for different parts of the business. Everywhere from fulfillment to customer support, to traffic to category teams to programs. And I would present on Amazon Smile there. And the way he would run that meeting and enable you to get through a metrics meeting for the entire North American retail business in one hour.

Ian McAllister (00:43:27):
And the way he ran that meeting would lead all those leaders to build these muscles because you wanted to be prepared to speak to the variances or trends in your business in a key metric and know your business and know what you were doing based on that thing. And so just this hour a week of probing and asking questions and everyone ... There might be a hundred people in that room prepared to answer questions about your business. And it had this cascading effect that not only was I or the leaders there on the spot having to answer a question and being prepared, but then I would do the same thing with my team, et cetera. And so I was trying to build those muscles in my team such that they could bring their insights and understanding and actions on things in this cascading effect. So that was a mechanism, which is another really big thing at Amazon that led to all these amazing behaviors.

Ian McAllister (00:44:17):
And I think a lot of those mechanisms came from Jeff Wilke or he created an environment where they would be developed throughout the organization and then propagated. And so that was one thing, just that operational mindset and rigor that being a product leader is not just about building new things, it's about how well you run what you've already built. And if you're really paying attention to the product that you operate, it will give you ideas for things you could do to double down on something that's happening well or to prevent something bad happening. And I think that's been a very key reason for Amazon's scale. Another thing I really respect about Jeff Wilke, and I think Doug Harrington has some of this as well, is the notion of a little bit of tough love. And I think that's important and that neither were assholes, but sometimes, and especially Wilke, you need to get that look kind of like your dad might look over his glasses at you and be like, "Hey."

Ian McAllister (00:45:15):
And so I think that was kind of the vibe that you would get. It was professional, it was respectful, but sometimes everyone needs a little kick in the ass and I think that was something, but it almost builds more respect from him and just incredible leaderly behavior, which I really respect and I try to model and I try to do the same because I respected it so much. And then I guess the last attribute of Wilke, which I really saw was teaching. And it wasn't just saying this is the right thing or this is what my decision is in a meeting, but teaching the why and the pattern, the mental model that informs him to think this is the right thing. And so I think he was just great at teaching, taking a moment. It might just take 10 seconds in a meeting to teach.

Ian McAllister (00:46:01):
And that's something that I've forgotten at different parts of my career, especially as you get more experienced and you know the right decision to do and you know what you want, whatever, that may be the right thing, but I think you'll have a lot more lasting effect if you could abstract it to a degree and teach the lesson. Because then that person will hopefully learn the lesson and can apply it to a bunch of future situations and also understand the why more. And it helps them sometimes disagree and commit more so than just being given prescriptive advice.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Sounds like it must have been an incredible experience learning from these two. Thanks for sharing all that. I want to get to the working backwards stuff. I feel like we've talked about this a lot. We've talked about this on other podcasts with other guests. I feel like people understand the general idea. Yeah, Amazon works backwards. They write a PR. Maybe there's a six pager thing they do. But I feel like there's not a lot of, here's how actually do this thing. And so just to spend a little time on this, when you see teams trying to work backwards and be like, "Let's work backwards. We're going to be like Amazon.", what do you find they do wrong when they're actually trying to implement this idea of working backwards? What's the most common mistake do you find?

Ian McAllister (00:47:11):
Well, working backwards is all about the problem and starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution. So when teams that do it wrong is they don't do that. They don't work backwards. They have something they want to build. These things look similar. These two technologies or whatever. We could combine them and then do this. And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards. And then you may use "the working backwards process", but you already have the solution. And so you're adding the problem after the solution. You're retrofitting the problem, retrofitting the customer. And so that I think is the number one thing is that they don't get the importance of truly starting with the problem that you're trying to solve and being faithful to that working backwards from the problem.

Ian McAllister (00:48:03):
When I first started at Amazon and community, we had this business of automated merchandising using community content, and that was the core thing we were doing is to grow that. But there was this Jeff idea that a team was super excited about. Because I think in some meeting he'd kind of sketched it out or whatever. And so that there was already all this momentum to build this thing that was actually a Jeff project, but I should have known at the time, in hindsight I do, because the name they had for this project was ASIN to ASIN linking. And ASIN was the identifier for a product on Amazon. And so it was kind of this not working backwards idea ultimately of if you could link to products by a subjected attributes and then you could build a feature around it that allowed customers to vote on these things and then it would be kind of ...

Ian McAllister (00:48:50):
So in spirit, it really wasn't working backwards. But the team was all excited and so we eventually wrote the press release and we did it. And it turned out, it wasn't successful. We ended up shutting it down later. And so I learned a lot, this was the first year or two at Amazon, about using the working backwards process but not really working backwards. And so that's literally, if I'm reviewing a working backwards press release or fact, or even talking with someone about a new initiative, my brain is wired now to not be able to process any information until I focus on the problem and the customer. And then once we start talking about that, then I can engage and literally work backwards to say, okay, how do we solve that problem? And what's the most elegant way to solve it? Or if there's three problems, what's number one or two or three? So it's probably a gap in me that I can't process information without working backwards from the problem, but I find it to be helpful when people do that.

Lenny (00:49:47):
So when people talk about working backwards, the way you're describing it is interesting where it's focused on start with the problem, which I think generally product teams try to do. Their one pagers their PRDs often have, here's the problem we're solving, here's why it's a problem, here's how we think about ... Is that the core of working backwards? I always imagined it was the launch release and the PR thing and maybe the FAQ. Working backwards at Uber and other and Airbnb, do you actually do that for every project yourself at this point?

Ian McAllister (00:50:17):
There's two parts of it. One, there's the concept of working backwards from what you're trying to accomplish. And I still absolutely do that with my teams as well. What are we trying to accomplish for the business or accomplish for a customer and let's start there. And if they have a problem that is interfering with their ability to be profitable for their ability, if it's a business customer or it's a customer trying to accomplish a goal, starting with that problem. That's different from the working backwards mechanism, which is the press release and the FAQ, which was the mechanism that Amazon used to enforce working backwards, which I think is effective. And I've tried to teach that and write some posts about with templates and things like that because it's a great way to start of the press release has a paragraph about the problem. That's what you write.

Ian McAllister (00:51:00):
And then you write the solution paragraph and then the customer quote. And then the fact which is is there a legitimate plan to succeed? So if you don't have that muscle to work backwards already and your team, it's a great thing to try, but that's not the only mechanism that can do it. And eventually if you do it enough and you build that muscle to work backwards, you can do it in any number of formats, whether it's something in a PRD or some other way. But the key is that you don't think what we could build, you think about the problem and then the solution that solves that problem.

Lenny (00:51:35):
Got it. Okay. So the press release is not core to it. It's like a trick to get you to think about the problem you're solving. It's not how you plant announce it.

Ian McAllister (00:51:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:51:43):
Interesting. I never thought about it that way. So when you're doing this process at other places outside Amazon, say you're a product leader that's trying to ... I want to improve the way we think about product. What is it that you suggest they do specifically? Is it write out, here's the problem we're solving? Is there more to it? What would you suggest there?

Ian McAllister (00:52:02):
If it's a blank slate, truly, you could certainly use the working backwards process like Amazon does with the internal press release and then the fact and so forth. So that's fine. But a lot of companies have a different way they go about it. Some companies are very much, it's slide culture and presentations and so forth. And so as a product leader you could think about what you do with your team and what you do upwards or across. And so you may have the latitude to use any process with your team. And I've done that at some companies where using documents and if they're supportive of the team and they recognize the value of that, like, oh actually this is good and this is a great way to write things down on paper and to have better information content and richer discussion that oftentimes I think people will find that versus a slide with a couple bullets is not great. Then you can build that muscle.

Ian McAllister (00:52:54):
And I've found it's a great way to teach and use those to dive deeper into product. But depending on the organization you're at, that may not wash to train your senior leadership to use the process you want to use. And so then it might be a matter of finding the opportunities to try something and saying, "Are you open to doing something this way?" A review of a doc instead of a review of a whatever. So that's a little separate than just working backwards, but I think you just have to acknowledge the environment you're in. And also, unless the organization has a specific format to do this. If it does, you probably just need to use it. Different leaders process information, different ways. You may find one format's effective with your leader, but another one to educate a broader organization. But it's very company specific. So despite what I might want to do, I've just got to recognize that I have more leverage down with my team versus up or across.

Lenny (00:53:51):
Is there a template that you use consistently? Is that something that you've published of how to frame the problem, how to frame all these other elements?

Ian McAllister (00:54:00):
I have shared posts on, I know for sure LinkedIn and I probably should put it on the newsletter, on my newsletter, that's a working backwards template and some posts about how to do the process or tips on how Amazon does the process. And so I'll make sure to put those up on my newsletter as well. And the template's free. Obviously anyone could just copy it and grab it.

Lenny (00:54:19):
Awesome. We'll link to that in show notes. Definitely send that to me after we wrap this thing. And I was going to ask, does Amazon work backwards on every product they work on/do you suggest working backwards in every feature and product?

Ian McAllister (00:54:33):
I think there's some scale below which it doesn't probably make sense to do this process because there's a little bit of overhead to it. But I think if it's a new product, absolutely. And I'm sure there's some at Amazon that don't use the process, but in general that was the way and often enforced that you need a working backwards review. Ideally that would happen at the outset, but sometimes it would be added later. And yeah, I think it's a great thing whether you use the mechanism. Again, it's a great template to start with and use if you have the flexibility to, but I think it's also possible just to have the spirit and to try to be true to the spirit of working backwards from what you're trying to do for customers and what problem. That's the most important thing. The template is just a mechanism to help ensure that happens.

Lenny (00:55:18):
Got it. You mentioned a review. What is that? Working backwards review?

Ian McAllister (00:55:22):
Well that would just be a meeting with leadership or other folks to review the concept, review the press release, review the FAQ and ask questions. And in some cases that would be the gate to approving it. That was the case with me and Bezos before we went off and built the team and launched Amazon Smile is I would do these reviews about different concepts and that was the one that we green lit. I mean that's often the case. It's also just a great way to educate other people about what you're trying to accomplish. Ground them in the customer problem and solution. And the FAQ is a whole nother concept. It's about the legitimate plan to succeed. One other thing that I use, I got a chance to have lunch with Jeff Bezos. It was probably back in 2008 or something like this. And I asked him, "What's your criteria for investing in something new?"

Ian McAllister (00:56:09):
And he said, "Well it's three things. One, is it a big idea? And then second, is it something we should be doing?" So if maybe you have an idea, if you have this new way to extract oil from shale, is it a big idea? Yeah, probably could be a big idea. Is it something Amazon should be doing? Probably not. And the third test, is there a legitimate plan to succeed? And you got to have all three of those things. And I think the FAQ part of the working backwards process is that early stage legitimate test of whether this thing has a plan. Because you could have this internal press release or big idea or big idea for a solution, but the FAQ basically says, okay, I've thought through the internal components or the finances or the key technical hurdles or whatever. And so that's one that's not written about as much, how to do the FAQ, but I think it's another way to build trust that you've been thoughtful enough given the stage of the product to deserve the resources or deserve to move forward with it.

Lenny (00:57:03):
That's awesome. I feel like most PMs listening to this are going to be like, "I always start with a problem. I'm always problem focused so I'm working backwards. So I'm good." Other signs of just like, no, you're not. You think you are but you're probably not doing this well. Is there a symptom of you're not actually doing this correctly?

Ian McAllister (00:57:23):
The most common thing that I see that tips me off is when they talk about something, there's different pieces in the pantry and we have these ingredients, we could put them together, we could add these two things together and make a meal out of it. And so it might be a technology, it might be a service, it might be two different things or the building blocks are there and what's enabled if you add these two building blocks together is something. But that's not really working backwards. It may be true that there's some leverage or some benefit from the company having these technologies or assets, but that to me is often the first step that these two things look similar. We combine them and it's all goodness in this new thing.

Ian McAllister (00:58:09):
So if you start talking about those things or the technology, I think that's a likely case that you're not really working backwards as opposed to the opposite is if there's a customer problem that feels compelling even before the solution, yeah, that does feel compelling. And just like with every startup out there, probably a lot of the pitches are there's a big audience and a painful problem and it's the painkiller versus the vitamin thing. And then we have a novel way to solve that. That's kind of working backwards. But more often, especially in a big company, you'll have all these ideas because you have more ingredients in the pantry of ways you could combine them and try to feed it to someone but may not be working backwards.

Lenny (00:58:56):
Awesome. We're reaching about an hour chatting and so I want to let you go. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you want to share on anything we've chatted about?

Ian McAllister (00:59:06):
Let's see. No. I mean I think we covered a bunch of good ground. It's been fun, but nothing particular.

Lenny (00:59:11):
Okay, great. Well then we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got six questions here. They'll be pretty quick and easy. Whatever comes to mind, share and we'll go through them relatively quickly. Sound good?

Ian McAllister (00:59:22):
All right. Let's do it.

Lenny (00:59:23):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?

Ian McAllister (00:59:28):
I say Getting Real by 37 Signals and it's specifically the chapter on epicenter design. I've shared that many, many times. You can link to it. That's definitely the most thing I've shared. For fun, The Wool Trilogy by Hugh Howey, he's probably my favorite author and a great series. And then for learning, just a recent one that I thought would be super fascinating was Energy and Civilization by Vaclav Smil. So it might not be on the best seller list, but I thought it was interesting.

Lenny (00:59:55):
What's another favorite podcast of yours other than this one possibly?

Ian McAllister (00:59:59):
I think How I Built This is really interesting just to decompose how interesting businesses and products came about. And then just because of my work, EV News Daily is a daily digest of what's going on in the electric vehicle space. So that's a very good use of my time, five minutes a day to get up to speed.

Lenny (01:00:18):
Very niche. I love it. What's a favorite movie or a TV show you've recently seen?

Ian McAllister (01:00:24):
Yellowstone. That's definitely my favorite. Can't wait for the next season. Montana's my happy place, although I'm probably the kind of person that they rail about in the show, so it's kind of ironic. And I think the movie was Everything Everywhere All At Once. I love movies that are not predictable and I thought that was just very creative.

Lenny (01:00:40):
I'm shocked by how many people on Yellowstone die. That show is just murder left and right. I was not expecting that on a ranch oriented show.

Ian McAllister (01:00:50):
It's a harsh environment.

Lenny (01:00:51):
Quite harsh, turns out. Especially if you mess with the Duttons. Next question. Favorite interview question that you like to ask.

Ian McAllister (01:00:58):
When I'm coming out of left field, I ask people at this stage in your career, what have you learned about yourself? How are you different from other people? No one's prepared for that.

Lenny (01:01:06):
What do you look for in their answers?

Ian McAllister (01:01:08):
I don't know. There's not one specific thing and there's no right answer, which maybe makes it unfair, but just maybe a little self-reflection and maybe they will have understanding their strengths and that might be a good bit of self-awareness about what makes them different, where they can harness that and that makes them a better PM or engineer or something. And so that's kind of what I'm looking for, but there's no set answer. It's more just to throw them off balance.

Lenny (01:01:32):
Interesting. Favorite app right now.

Ian McAllister (01:01:35):
It's probably not too interesting, but to be honest, YouTube. It's like the eighth wander of the world and just every day I'm amazed if I want to learn about something new. A couple summers ago I had some time off and so I basically taught myself how to do woodworking and built a kitchen and other stuff. And so it's just like it continues to be this resource and this jewel that helps me grow and learn about anything.

Lenny (01:01:58):
I imagine some people are watching this on YouTube right now.

Ian McAllister (01:02:01):
All right.

Lenny (01:02:02):
I just read a story about an Olympic javelin thrower who learned how to do this watching YouTube. He was somewhere in, I think maybe Africa. He had no coaches around and he just watched this one other javelin guy that just shared lessons on how to do this and became incredibly good. It's insane.

Ian McAllister (01:02:18):
And I mean, I'm old, so I didn't have this when I was growing up. I remember going to the library and sending away for a brochure in the back of a magazine and things. Learning was not so easy back then. The internet obviously was a huge resource and is, but then YouTube as well to see somebody do it. It's also interesting to see somebody live. So anyway, I'm a fan.

Lenny (01:02:40):
Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader, someone you look up to?

Ian McAllister (01:02:46):
I say Gibson Biddle. I think that he is one, just tremendous amount of product experience that I think is valuable. I respect the fact that he takes the time to share it. He doesn't have to, but he does. And he's also a great communicator and he invests in being ... You can tell he measures [inaudible 01:03:02] of his talks and things like this. He's invested over his career to be a great communicator. So I think he's a good role model for me and I think for others out there.

Lenny (01:03:11):
That guy's a force. I'm happy that we've had him on this podcast. I'm hoping that everyone eventually, that people mention in this question we end up having on this podcast. So that's great to check. I also love Gibson. He's got a great newsletter. Askgibbs.substack.com I think. Ian, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. I really appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Ian McAllister (01:03:38):
Yeah, I guess Twitter's a great place. So IanMcAll, I-A-N-M-C-A-L-L, is my handle. And then I've started a newsletter. I'm not that frequent to be honest. I have a lot of good intentions and a bunch of ideas. Ianmcallister.substack.com. And that's something to connect and feel free to subscribe and hit me up on Twitter if you have ideas for posts or questions. And if I can answer in a tweet, I will. If not, I might put it on the queue of things to write about. And yeah, thanks for having me on Lenny. We were talking earlier about writing or doing other things and the value of that is just making connections with people. And so that was what I was one, just to reconnect with you is awesome. And to whatever extent I get a chance to make new connections in the world, that's a good thing.

Lenny (01:04:25):
Amazing. And we originally connected over that piece that you wrote, so it all circles back 10 years later maybe. Thanks, Ian.

Ian McAllister (01:04:32):
All right. Thanks Lenny.

(03:22):
First up, we've got Eeke De Miliano. Eeke was head of product at Retool. She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.

Eeke De Miliano (03:36):
"To what do you attribute your success?" And you can't say "luck". Because I think humble people will always say "luck" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.

Lenny (03:58):
Next up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Geoff Charles (04:06):
I ask, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.

Lenny (04:31):
Next up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.

Shishir Mehrotra (04:56):
It's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14]." This question will actually work well for any role. But say, "You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?" That's the whole question.

(05:23):
Usually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, "Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?" All these different questions come out.

(05:39):
I'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, "Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?"

(05:59):
Interestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, "Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. "Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?"

(06:31):
The second one is, "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?"

(06:37):
And then he took those two questions, and he said, "Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants." You can say, "Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run." Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, "Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it."

(06:59):
On the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.

(07:12):
If it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, "Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?"

(07:32):
But these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.

(07:45):
That question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, "I guess I would ask them what size it is." I'm like, "Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.

(08:16):
But then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, "How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, "What is the question that really drives this answer?"

Lenny (08:45):
This next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.

Yuhki Yamashita (08:53):
"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(09:25):
Or sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, "Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on." The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, "Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.

Lenny (09:57):
Next you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.

Katie Dill (10:12):
"Tell me what work you are most proud of?" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Karri Saarinen (10:36):
I think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.

Camille Hearst (11:04):
I like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.

Lenny (11:29):
Next is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.

Jiaona Zhang (11:35):
I do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?

(11:44):
Ambiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward.

(12:05):
I think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (12:44):
Next up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.

Noah Weiss (12:49):
"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" When I say "unfair" or "secret", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. "What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.

Lenny (13:11):
This next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.

Ben Williams (13:22):
"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.

(13:49):
Also, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking "why" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.

(14:08):
And then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.

Lenny (14:42):
Next up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):
"What would your siblings say about you?" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, "What will your parents say about you?" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.

Lenny (15:00):
What do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):
I look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, "My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together," that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, "Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me," that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.

Lenny (15:30):
Next is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.

Paige Costello (15:36):
I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (16:15):
We are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (16:25):
"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you could do that for, "What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.

(16:53):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.

(17:19):
There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate." When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.

Lenny (17:52):
This next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.

Ayo Omojola (18:01):
"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or, "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?"

Lenny (18:21):
Next up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.

Scott Belsky (18:31):
I like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.

(18:49):
I also like the question, "Do you consider yourself lucky?" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.

Lenny (19:18):
Our penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.

Lauryn Isford (19:26):
"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (19:46):
Our final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.

Paul Adams (20:00):
I have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.

Lenny (20:23):
And it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable. Leave a comment either on the newsletter post, or in the YouTube comments, or even on Twitter. Let me know what you think. If there's a great response, we'll continue to do this. If not, we'll never do this again. All right, thank you. Enjoy.

Itamar Gilad (00:00:00):
You fake it, you do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz tests. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and behind the scenes and according to the permissions that the users gave us some of us moved just the subject and the sender into the right place. So initially the interviewer kind of distracted them and then showed them their inbox and then the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place more or less if we got it right. And people were like, "Wow, this is actually very cool." But it gave us some evidence to go and say, "Hey, we should try and build this thing."

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences, building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Itamar Gilad. Itamar, is a product coach, author, speaker and former longtime product manager at Google where you worked on Gmail, identity and YouTube. He also just published an awesome new book called Evidence-Guided: Creating High-Impact Products in the Face of Uncertainty. Itamar, has an important perspective on why and also how you can push your team and organization from an opinion-based decision-making process to a more evidence guided approach. In our conversation, Itamar, shares a number of very practical and handy frameworks that do just that including the confidence meter, metrics trees, GIST and the GIST board, plus his take on how people often misuse ICE for prioritizing ideas. Also, how you could make your OKRs more effective and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Itamar Gilad, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company.

(00:01:49):
I actually used Ezra, earlier this year unrelated to this podcast completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening which means they didn't find anything cancerous. But they did find some issues in my back which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:02:40):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra, team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be is what I have or fatty liver disease. Ezra, scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free and Ezra, is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny. That's E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

Itamar Gilad (00:04:40):
It's a pleasure being here, thank you for inviting me.

Lenny (00:04:42):
It's my pleasure. I thought we'd start with the story of your work on Google+ and Gmail and how those experiences formed your perspective on how to build a successful product. Can you share that story?

Itamar Gilad (00:04:57):
Google+ was my first experience at Gmail, I joined Gmail in August 2011 and the first thing they asked me is, "Let's connect Gmail with Google+." If you're hazy about the story, back then Facebook was massive. It's still massive but then it was growing like mushrooms, people were spending hours. That really freaked out Google and the obvious solution was to launch a social network of Google called Google+ and we all believe in this thing, it really caught on very well initially we all used it, we all believed in it. So our mission was to build this thing and Google really cut no costs. It created a whole new division within Google and it created a whole strategy around Google+ and we had to connect Gmail and YouTube and search to Google+ to make them more personalized in a sense and more social. So that was the idea and we went on and we launched a series of features in Gmail for a couple of years, honestly and Google+ itself became this massive project, very feature rich and with a lot of redesigns and iterations and none of it worked.

(00:06:09):
It turned out people actually didn't need another social network, people didn't love it, people didn't use it. Eventually in Gmail we rolled back all the Google+ integration a few years later and Google+ itself was shut down in 2019. So putting aside all the tremendous waste that went into this, all the millions of person hours and personal weeks. In hindsight, not only did Google bet on the wrong thing it missed much easier opportunities. So just not far from Google's headquarters there was WhatsApp, not very famous in the US but they actually created massive impact. Hundreds of millions of people were using their stuff and they became a threat to Facebook much more than Google was. So Google missed the opportunity of social mobile apps like WhatsApp, like Snapchat, etc and for me this story kind of was the epitome of what I call today, opinion-based development. We come up with an idea, we believe in it, all the indications show it's good.

(00:07:13):
Maybe the early tests show it's good, then we just go all in and we try to implement it and I made this very mistake many times as the product manager, I was the guy pushing for the ideas. So for me, this was kind of a turning point I felt we need to adopt a different system.

Lenny (00:07:32):
And just before you move on to the next story, how big was the team? Roughly how many years was spent on this area? Just to give people a sense of the waste as you said.

Itamar Gilad (00:07:41):
So there was a tremendous earthquake inside Google to create the Google+ team, teams and the entire divisions were kind of thrown apart and reformatted and I think at its peak it was about 1000 people inside-

Lenny (00:07:55):
Wow, [inaudible 00:07:56].

Itamar Gilad (00:07:56):
It was a division the size of Android and Docs and a really sizable thing, they're under their own buildings. It's taken from the playbook of Steve Jobs, create this whole secretive project inside and just run like hell.

Lenny (00:08:13):
Yeah. I remember though Facebook was really scared, I remember they shut everything down. It as like a code DEFCON one situation too, so it really scared Facebook at the same time.

Itamar Gilad (00:08:22):
Yeah, it's true. But at the end of the day, neither Google's advertising revenue was affected, neither was Facebook affected. So it turned out this idea was not that necessary after all.

Lenny (00:08:35):
Yeah, okay. So that's an example of something that didn't work because it was opinion based software, I think the phrase you used and then there's a different experience with tabs I think with Gmail.

Itamar Gilad (00:08:47):
That's right. So Google, is a very successful company. It's not for me to criticize it or to in hindsight kind of say you guys need to be better and some of the people that were behind Google+ was some of the smartest leaders and I still think they are despite this story. If you look back at the history of Google, how things started in the first decade or so. Google, was what I call an evidence guided company. So essentially it put a high premium on focusing on customers, coming up with a lot of ideas on looking at the data, looking at how these ideas actually worked out. They weren't shy about launching betas and things that were very rough and incomplete and learning from that and then they expected people to take action based on the results. So fail fast is a very famous paradigm and so you had to kill your project or pivot it seriously if it didn't work out and I think had we kept fail fast it would've really have helped Google+, if we had this mentality.

(00:09:56):
But for some reason with Google+, Google put this playbook aside and used a different playbook which I call plan and execute essentially. But I think inside Google the DNA still existed. So inside Gmail, the next project after Google+ was the tabbed inbox. So it was kind of the reverse of Google+, it started as a very small idea that no one believed in and we started looking what's behind the city? What's the goal? What's the problem actually we're trying to solve? It turned out that a lot of people were receiving social notifications and promotions, etc, and most of them were very passive. They weren't clearing their inbox, they were just living in this world of clutter and I came up with an idea how to fix this. I was sure it was great, I wanted to push it, plan and execute, but my colleagues were like, "Hold on, we actually tried this. We have a bunch of ideas to help people organize their inbox, they're not using it. Why is your idea good?"

(00:10:57):
So that sent us, kind of me and my team into researching these users into establishing a goal that was much more user-centric and then thinking of other ideas. And then we started testing them much more rigorously and basically we started testing on our own inboxes and then we recruited other dog footers, other Googlers to test the same inbox, then we put it outside for external testers. We did usability studies, we did data, we built a whole data mining team and a whole machine learning team to build the right categorization and we ended up with a solution that turned out to be very successful for a lot of these passive users. This was a surprise to a lot of people because most of my colleagues and most of the people I talk with actually know how to manage their inbox. So for them that solution makes complete nonsense, like splitting promotions and social to the side sounds like the stupidest idea. But there's about 85% of the population, 85 to 88% that absolutely love it and today Gmail has about 1.8 billion active users according to Gmail.

(00:12:14):
Most of these users are using this feature, so it was a pretty high impact feature as well.

Lenny (00:12:20):
And the feature specifically, just in case people aren't totally getting it is the promotions folder and the social I think and then the regular.

Itamar Gilad (00:12:27):
Yeah, there are a couple more that you can enable in settings if you like.

Lenny (00:12:30):
Yeah, I use it, I love it. Except it puts my newsletter in people's promotions folder, who do I talk to about that?

Itamar Gilad (00:12:36):
Yeah. Newsletters are a very complicated scenario for the categorization engine.

Lenny (00:12:41):
Yeah. We just need an exception for my newsletter and then we're good. Okay, but go on.

Itamar Gilad (00:12:45):
So in hindsight I was asking and saying, "Why was this project so different?" And I think the reason is that we didn't have that much confidence in our opinions. We had opinions, we had ideas but we didn't just go all in and just let's build it. We actually used an evidence guided system and I think that's not unique just to Google. I think every successful product company out there that you look at Amazon, Airbnb, anyone you will check, at least in their best periods they found a way to balance human judgment with evidence. They didn't try to obliterate human judgment and opinion just to supercharge them with evidence and they came up with very different models. Apple, is another example but the principle still holds in all of these companies.

Lenny (00:13:33):
Awesome. So you took that experience and all the experience you've had from coaching product leaders working with companies and you wrote this book called Evidence-Guided, which people on YouTube could see sitting there behind you. So I want to talk through some of these stories and then some of these other lessons and frameworks that emerged. But maybe just to start, what's the elevator pitch for this book?

Itamar Gilad (00:13:55):
So this is a book for people like us, product people who want to bring evidence guided thinking or modern product management if you like into their organizations. There's a lot of challenges, it's not simple, we all read the books, we all know the theory, we all know some parts of the system. It tries to give you a system how to do that, it's a meta framework that kind of helps you lift your organization in the direction of evidence guidance if that's what you want to do.

Lenny (00:14:23):
So going back to the story briefly before we get into the frameworks and lessons of the book. In the first example of Google+, basically it came top down, "Hey, we need to build a social network, go build it." Obviously that happens at a lot of companies, I don't know if there's an easy answer to this. But are there cases where it does make sense to approach it that way? Obviously Apple is a classic example of Steve Jobs, is like we need to build an iPhone. I don't know if that's exactly how it went. But are there instances where it is worth just approaching new product ideas that way based on the experience and creativity and insights of the founder? Or is your thinking it should always come from this evidence-based approach?

Itamar Gilad (00:15:01):
I think the founders are very important, especially in the startup and scale-ups phase. They come up with many of the most important ideas and it's super important that they have the space to express and to push the organization to look at those. However, it's not about shutting them down it's about looking at them critically. You need to create the environment in the organization where the leader comes and says, "You know what? I talked to these three customers, I figured it out. Here's what we need to do in the next five years." And you need to ask, "Where's your evidence?" And by the way, the example you give that's a classic example. Steve Jobs, he just brainstorm in his kitchen the iPhone and then just told the team to build it. That's the story Steve Jobs, told but it's not the real story at all. Now we know what actually happened and the iPhone has actually a story of discovery, of trial and error, multiple projects to do it, multitouch with phones, most of them failed.

(00:16:02):
Steve Jobs, was the architect. He kind of managed to connect the dots and eventually come up with this perfect device but he wasn't actually the creator, it wasn't his brainchild. He was actually against it for a while but over time as he saw the evidence, as he saw what this thing can do, as he saw the demos he was able to piece together something that was very useful.

Lenny (00:16:26):
That's really important insight. People that are hearing this might feel like I like this idea of pushing back and encouraging the founders to make it more evidence guided. In the case of say Google+, was it even possible? Could you have come to Larry and Sergey and be like, "Here's all this data I've gathered that tells us this is not going to work?" Do you have any advice for how to push back and encourage the founders and execs to really take the counterpoint seriously or really kind of vet their idea?

Itamar Gilad (00:16:58):
So another nice thing about Google is that it's a very open culture and people are not shy to tell even Sergey and Larry that they are wrong and they do this all the time. In certain forms, right? You need to know the right channels. But there was a very big discussion about Google+ and whether it's the right thing to create a clone of Facebook, there was a very public internal discussion. I think what I would change is not have this discussion based on opinions, because when you have the discussion you come with your own opinions usually the most senior person's opinions will win. That's just the way it is. If we had come with hard data and we said, "Listen, things are not actually panning out the way you guys are expecting. What can we do? Should we continue? Should we pivot this?" I think the discussion would've done better. Now I'm doing a huge disservice, I was not in all the discussions. I know probably in Google+, there were very serious discussions happening along these lines.

(00:18:02):
But it's just as a general trend, I find that evidence is very empowering for us smaller people in the organization or mid-level managers to be empowered to challenge the opinions.

Lenny (00:18:15):
Is there anything tactically you found to be useful and effective in giving people, say they don't work at Google. They work at companies where founders and bosses and execs are not as open to challenge. [inaudible 00:18:26] any tactically found about how to present a counter proposal or like, "Hey, I have this data that we should really pay attention to?"

Itamar Gilad (00:18:33):
I think if you come with data, if you run a secret experiment and you come back and you show them you usually get one of two results. Either they get extremely mad at you and they tell you to get back to work and to do what you were told and in that case, probably you need to start polishing your resume and look for another place either inside the organization or outside it because that person is not being reasonable to be honest. But the more common case is they're pleasantly surprised and that's what happened with Steve Jobs, as well. He was against phones but then people showed him all sorts of evidence that Apple can make a phone. He was against multitouch initially but then he changed his mind, there was a lot of back and forth. So even, Steve Jobs, given evidence was willing to flip and I say this in many organizations. So evidence is so powerful, that's why this is the principle I based the book on.

Lenny (00:19:28):
You have this concept of being evidence guided. People listening may feel like, "Hey, we're evidence guided, we're in experiments, we make decisions using data." Oftentimes they aren't actually and so what are signs that maybe you're not actually that evidence guided or as evidence guided as you think you are?

Itamar Gilad (00:19:45):
I think there's a few telltale signs that I look for, first the goals are very unclear. Either there are many or they're very kind of obscure and vague or they are about output, there's misalignment. So the goals part is not there, usually this goes hand in hand with metrics. Missing metrics or just using revenue and business metric but there's no user facing metrics. So that's another telltale sign, then there's a lot of time and effort spent on planning especially on road mapping. Creating the perfect roadmap which really can consume a lot of time of the top management and PMs, etc. Then as you go down you see there's not a lot of experimentation and if there is experimentation there's not a lot of learning and finally another telltale sign is that the team is disengaged. So the engineers are kind of getting the signal that what they need to do is deliver, they're focused on output, that's what they're measured on. So they're kind of disengaged, they're disengaged from the users, from the business, they don't care that much.

(00:20:57):
It's usually something that you can fix by adopting a more evidence guided system.

Lenny (00:21:05):
Okay. So let's dive into your approach to becoming more evidence guided. In the book, you share this model that you call the GIST model which is kind of this overarching approach to building a product that almost forces you to be more evidence guided. So let's just start with what's the simplest way to understand this GIST model?

Itamar Gilad (00:21:26):
With your permission, I can show a few slides.

Lenny (00:21:28):
Oh, let's do it.

Itamar Gilad (00:21:29):
And maybe that will help.

Lenny (00:21:32):
Here we go, and then yeah, a good excuse to go check this out on YouTube.

Itamar Gilad (00:21:36):
All right, you're seeing this? So this is the GIST model, goals, ideas, steps and tasks, and essentially it's tries to break the change which is a really big change for a lot of companies into four slightly more manageable parts. They're still big but each one you can tackle on its own and that's kind of the reason I kind of split it, and goals are about defining what we're trying to achieve, ideas are hypothetical ways to achieve the goals, steps are ways to implement the idea and validate it at the same time. So essentially build, measure learn loops and tasks are the things we manage in Kanban and Jira and all these good tools. These are the things that your development team is usually very focused on and just listening to this, a lot of this will sound familiar to you because GIST is not a brand new invention. It's a meta framework that puts in place a lot of existing methodologies. It's based on lean startup, on design thinking, product discovery, growth, There's a lot of all of these things here. It just tries to put them all into one framework or one model.

Lenny (00:22:43):
So what's the simplest way to think about what this model is meant for? Is this how you think about your roadmap? Is this how you plan? What is this trying to tell people to do differently in the way they build product broadly?

Itamar Gilad (00:22:56):
I would say these are four areas that you need to look at and ask, are we doing the right thing in each? In each you may need to change or even transform and as I go and explain each one of those I'll give you basically three things. In each chapter in the book I try to touch on three things. The principles behind them, the frameworks or models that implement the principles and then process and the process honestly is the most brittle part and the one that you would need to change and adapt to your company. Because not two companies are exactly the same, and it's very tempting when you write a book not to give any process but that's the part that people actually want the most. So it's included as well, but just be aware that you will have to change this process.

Lenny (00:23:44):
Awesome. Okay, so we're going to talk about each of these four layers. Before we do that, where do vision and strategy fit into this? Do they bucket into one of these four layers and how do you think about strategy and vision?

Itamar Gilad (00:23:55):
That's a great question, so there's this whole strategic context that is outside of GIST. GIST, is not trying to tackle that, it assumes it's in place, there's another huge blob which is research. GIST, is not about research it's more about discovery and delivery. But strategy is extremely important and you can use some of the tools we will talk about to develop your strategy as well. In many companies the strategy is just a roadmap on steroids, it's small plan and execute just on a grand scale and Google+ again, was a strategic choice actually if you think about it. So in the book there is a chapter where I touch on strategy and I explain how the same evidence guided methods are being used by companies to develop their strategy as well.

Lenny (00:24:43):
Awesome, maybe one last context question. So people might be seeing this and thinking okay cool, I have goals, I have ideas steps, I have tasks, I'm already doing this. What is this kind of a counter or reaction to? What are people probably missing when they're seeing this and they're like, "Oh, I see. This is like what we're not doing and this is the most important, this is something we should probably change." And we'll go through these in detail too.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:03):
I think talking about each one will help.

Lenny (00:25:06):
Okay, let's do it.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:09):
But we can talk about in each level what's actually being done. So when people say I have goals, usually they take the goals layer and use it as a planning session. They talk about what shall we build by when, what are the resources? And that's actually not goals at all, that's planning work.

Lenny (00:25:26):
Cool, let's talk about goals and I know part of this is OKRs related too, so I'm excited to hear your take on OKRs.

Itamar Gilad (00:25:33):
Oh, that's a whole different discussion. You had, Christina, the real expert over there so I doubt I can add more to that. But it's true OKR is all part of it, but let's start with goals. What's our goals supposed to be? Goals are supposed to paint the end state to define where we want to end up and the evidence will not guide you unless you know where you want to go, and in many companies what you have is goals at the top for revenue, market share, whatever it is, and then a bunch of siloed goals for each department. There's engineering goals, there's design goals, there's marketing goals, etc, and that actually pushes people into different vectors and it's really hard to decide. I would argue that in evidence guided companies, and you've worked for a few so probably you've seen this. They use models in order to construct overarching goals for the entire organization. One of the models I show in the chapter about goals is the value exchange loop.

(00:26:34):
 Where basically the organization is trying to deliver as much value as it can to the market and to capture as much value back, and by creating a feedback loop between these two you are actually able to grow very fast. Now, I would argue that you want to measure both of these and to put a metric on each and the metric we usually use to measure value delivered is called the North Star metric. I know you wrote an article, a very good article about it.

Lenny (00:27:01):
Thank you.

Itamar Gilad (00:27:02):
And in it you listed dozens and dozens of companies, like leading companies and what they considered the North Star metric is super interesting. I would argue that what they told you is what is the most important metrics we measure? What is the number one metric for us? But it's not what I call the North Star metric, the North Star metric measures how much value we create for the market. For example, let's take WhatsApp. WhatsApp for a very long time measured messages sent because every message sent is a little incremental of value for the sender, the receiver, it's free, it's rich media, you can send it for anywhere in the world, compared to SMS that's huge value. So if in year one we have a billion messages being sent in year two, two billion probably we doubled the amount of value. In Airbnb, I think one of your key metrics or the real North Star metric was nights booked. I don't know if it was still the case while you were there?

Lenny (00:27:55):
Yeah, absolutely.

Itamar Gilad (00:27:56):
And there are examples like this in Amplitude for example, they measure active learning users or weekly active learning users. Which are users that found in the tool some insight that was so important that they shared it with at least two other users and they consume it. So it's a very powerful thing to point at this metric and say, "This is the most important metric combined with the value metric that we want to capture, revenue, market share, whatever it is." Once you have these two, you can further break them down into what I call metrics trees. So there's a metric three for the North Star metric and there's the metric three for the top KPI, the top business metric which you see here on the left side in blue and usually they overlap. So you might find in the middle some metrics that are super, super important because moving them actually moves the needle on everything else.

Lenny (00:28:57):
Can you clarify again the difference between what you call this top KPI versus North Star metric?

Itamar Gilad (00:29:02):
So the North Star metric is measuring how much value we're creating for the user, the core value that they're getting. In this case this is some productivity suite, so this is number of documents created per month for example. Because we think that every document created maybe it's a small document, I don't know. AI is in fashion now, is a little incremental value, so that's the number we're trying to grow. The top KPI is what we expect to get, it should be revenue or profit.

Lenny (00:29:31):
I see, this is the value exchange. I see, one is what users are getting, one is what you're getting back from them.

Itamar Gilad (00:29:36):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:29:37):
Basically how the business is benefiting. Awesome. I think this is a really important concept, the metric tree. I think a lot of people think they have something like this in mind where they're just like, "Cool, here's our North Star Metric, here's the levers and things that we can work on to move that." But I think actually mapping it out the way you have it here where it kind of goes layers and layers deep to all of the different variables that impact this metric. Not only is it a way to think about impact and goals and things like that, but also helps you estimate the impact of the experiment you're potentially thinking about running. So if you're going to work on something at the bottom here like activation rate, say you move that 10%. How much is that going to impact this global metric? It's probably a very small amount.

Itamar Gilad (00:30:19):
This is a very important one and we'll talk about impact assessment shortly, this helps with it. It also helps with alignment because the entire organization is trying to move these two metrics, it's the two sides of our mission essentially. We have the mission that's the top objective of the company and these are the two top most key results if you like, the top most things. So when you go and work with another team and you say, "Hey, why don't you work on my project?" They might say, "This idea actually might move the North Star metric model in your idea." And that helps you guys align and I've seen cases where team B put aside their own ideas to jump on the ideas of team A, because of this model. It also creates an opportunity to give some sub metrics to teams to own on an ongoing basis, so it creates a little sense of ownership as well and mission within the tree.

Lenny (00:31:10):
It also helps you figure out what teams you should have, which teams have the biggest potential to impact the metric.

Itamar Gilad (00:31:18):
Another thing that happens in a lot of organizations, the team topology reflects the structure of the software or some hierarchical model where we want to organize the organization in a particular way. But if you start with a metrics tree, you can try to arrange the topology around goals and sometimes you need to readjust. It's not a constant reorg but from time to time you will realize the goals have changed and we need to reorganize, so the tree helps visualize that as well.

Lenny (00:31:49):
I think for people that are listening to this and thinking about this, I think the simplest way to even think about this is basically there's a math formula that equals your North Star metric or your revenue or whatever you're trying to do and if you don't have some ideally really clear sense of what that math formula is you should work on that. Because that will inform so much of how you think about where to invest, what teams to have, where to invest more resources, less resources.

Itamar Gilad (00:32:13):
Right.

Lenny (00:32:15):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team, for Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4 they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn, generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn, have two times the buying power of the average web audience and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.

(00:33:20):
Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign, just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny, terms and conditions apply. Okay. So metrics trees, what comes next?

Itamar Gilad (00:33:39):
All right. So next we need to go to the ideas layer and the ideas layer is there to help us sort through the many ideas we might encounter and they may come from as you said the founders, the managers, the stakeholders, from the team, from research, from competitors. We're flooded with ideas, and what usually happens inside organization is some sort of battle of opinions or some sort of politics sometimes or highest paid person's opinion. You had, Ronny Kohavi, who invented this term in your show. What doesn't happen is very rational, logical decisions these are the best ideas, because it's really, really hard to predict honestly. There is so much uncertainty in the needs of the users, in the changes in the market, in our technology, in our product, in our own organization. It's almost impossible to say this idea is going to be the best, but we do say this because we have cognitive biases that kind of convince us that this idea is far superior to anything else and it's definitely the right choice.

(00:34:48):
In order to avoid this, what we want to do is to evaluate the ideas in a much more objective and consistent and transparent way. In the book I suggest using ICE, impact, confidence and ease. I think I have a slide coming on this. So impact, confidence and ease which is basically a way to assign three values to each idea. The impact tries to assess how much impact it'll have on the goals and that's why it's so important that we have very clear goals and not many. How we are measuring the ideas on the North Star metric, on the top business KPI, on a local metric of the team. Whatever it is, let's be clear about it and then let's evaluate the ideas against this thing. Ease, is basically the opposite of effort. How easy or hard it's going to be, but both of those are guesstimates, both of those are things we need to estimate. I would argue that just by breaking the question to these two questions we usually have a slightly better discussion than just my idea is better than yours.

(00:35:52):
But then there's the third element which is confidence, which tries to assess how sure are we or should we be about our first guesstimates about the impact and the ease.

Lenny (00:36:03):
It's interesting you use the word ease, because I think it's usually effort. You kind of make it positive, is that an intentional tweak you made?

Itamar Gilad (00:36:12):
I'm using the definitions of, Sean Ellis. Sean, invented ICE. You know Sean, I don't know if you've had him yet? But he's-

Lenny (00:36:21):
I haven't had him on yet.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:23):
Yeah. For the people who don't know him, Sean, is amazing. He's like one of the fathers of the growth movement, he coined the term growth hacking and he popularized the concept of product market fit.

Lenny (00:36:36):
Yeah.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:36):
He created ICE, he created a bunch of things that we use in product that we don't even know.

Lenny (00:36:40):
Wow, I didn't know he came up with ICE. Okay, cool. So the original version of ICE is ease instead of effort.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:45):
Exactly, yeah.

Lenny (00:36:45):
Fun fact.

Itamar Gilad (00:36:47):
A lot of your viewers are wondering where's the R because there's another variant of this culture. RICE, where there's rich as well. I prefer ICE because I prefer to fold the rich into the I for various reasons but both are valid, both are equivalent in a sense.

Lenny (00:37:04):
I'm in your boat, that's exactly how I think about it. I think people over complicate this stuff and try to get so many math formulas involved with estimating impact, and I feel like these are just simple heuristics to kind of bubble the best ideas to the top. It doesn't have to be a perfect estimate of impact and confidence and all those things, so I think the simpler is better and it always ends up being a spreadsheet. People always have these tools to estimate these things but it's like a spreadsheet, Google Sheets. Great.

Itamar Gilad (00:37:28):
So yeah, you're actually leading me to my next point. So when you come to estimate impact you will realize it's the hardest part. So sometimes it's just a gut feeling and it's a guess and sometimes it's based on some spreadsheet or some analysis and the back of envelope calculation you've done and I think that's legitimate. Sometimes these things do show you some things you didn't think of and sometimes the best case it's based on tests. You actually tested it, you interviewed 12 customers, you show them the thing and out of those only one actually liked it. You should reduce your impact based on that usually, or you do other types of tests. We'll talk about testing in a second. What happens is that people tend to just go with gut instinct and then give themselves a high confidence. They say it's an eight and I'm pretty convinced, so it's eight for confidence and I found this a bit disturbing because it kind of subverts the whole system.

(00:38:22):
So I wanted to help people realize when they have strong evidence in support of their guesses and when it's weak evidence, how to calculate confidence in a sense. For that I created a tool called the confidence meter, which you can see here this colorful thing and should I go and explain it?

Lenny (00:38:41):
Yeah, let's do it. And then again, if you're just listening to this you can check this out on YouTube and you can see the actual slide.

Itamar Gilad (00:38:47):
All right, awesome. So basically I constructed it a bit like a thermo meter. It goes from very low confidence which is the blue area or the upper right, all the way to high confidence which is the red area and you can see the numbers going from zero to 10. Where zero is very low confidence, we don't know basically anything we're just guessing in the dark and 10 is full confidence. You know for sure this thing is a success, no doubt about it and across the circle I put various classes of evidence you might find along the way. So for example, starting at the top right, all of these blue areas about opinions. It could be your own self-confidence in the idea, your self conviction, you feel it's a great idea. Guess what? Behind every terrible idea that was ever someone thought it was great, that gives you 0.01 out of 10. Maybe you created a shiny pitch deck or a six-page document that explains in detail why this is a great idea. Slightly harder to do but still very low confidence, maybe you connected it to some theme, it's about the blockchain...

(00:39:59):
Well sorry, the blockchain is out of fashion. What's hot right now?

Lenny (00:39:59):
AI.

Itamar Gilad (00:40:04):
Exactly, AI. It's about AI, that makes it a good idea? Absolutely not. Or the strategy of the company, that's another thematic support. Thousands and thousands of terrible ideas are being implemented right now as we speak based on these themes. So all these things combined can give you a maximum 0.1 out of 10 according to the tool, if you follow it then we move into slightly harder tests. One is reviewing it with your colleagues, your managers, your stakeholders the idea. They don't know it either, they don't have a crystal ball, they're usually not the users, they cannot predict. But they can evaluate it in a slightly more objective way and maybe find flaws in your idea. On the other hand groups tend to have biases too, politics group thing. So groups can actually arrive sometimes with worse decisions than individuals, there's some research to that. Next, our estimates and plans. So you may do some sort of back of the envelope calculation or your colleagues might go out and try to evaluate the ease a little bit better.

(00:41:07):
That gives you a little bit more confidence, but still we're at the level of guesswork at this point. Next we're moving to data and data could be anecdotal. So you find a few data points dotted across your data or you talk to a handful of customers or maybe one competitor has that same idea. In many companies I meet, if the leading competitor has this feature and we think it's a good idea validation is done. Let's launch it, that's it. It's a great idea, we need to do it. It never works honestly, you should not assume that your competitor actually knows what they're doing anymore than you do. Data could be also what I call market data. That comes from surveys, from assessing a lot of your data by doing a deep competitive analysis and there are other methods where you create a larger dataset and you contrast your idea against it. Finally, to gain medium and high confidence you really need to build your idea and test it and that's where the red area is.

(00:42:11):
So there's various forms of tests, we'll talk about them if we have time and they give you various levels of confidence.

Lenny (00:42:19):
Awesome, this is a very cool visual. We'll link to a image of this in the show notes too if people want to check it out. I think what's awesome about this is you could just use this as a little tool on your team of just like where are we along the spectrum? We think the impact of this is very high. But we're probably in this blue area of confidence and so let's just make sure we understand that and it's really clear language to help people understand. I see if we had this, it'd be a lot more confident.

Itamar Gilad (00:42:45):
So you can also tie your investment into the idea based on the level of confidence you had found essentially, so early on you want to do the cheap stuff just to gain more confidence and then you can go and invest more. If it's a really cheap idea, you can jump to a high confidence idea, you can test, you can do an AB experiment. Early adopter program, whatever it is and then launch it. Some ideas you don't need to test, sometimes the expert opinion is enough. If you're just changing the order of the settings, no one sees this or no one will be impacted. The risk is low, you can launch it without testing. So part of the trick is also knowing when to stop, not just trying to force your way all the way up when you don't have to.

Lenny (00:43:31):
That's a really important point. The other important point here is just a big part of a PM's job is to say no and to stop stupid shit from happening and this is an awesome tool to help you do that. To be like, okay, here's this idea you have, just like let's just be real, how confident are we in this? And, okay, it's going to take us three months to do this. Maybe we should think about something different, maybe we should work up the confidence meter before we actually commit to this.

Itamar Gilad (00:43:56):
Yeah. This is a real world usage that I hear about a lot, some people use this to kind of do... An objective way to say no and gently. Or to say we'll think about it but look at these other ideas we have and how their impacting is and confidence stack up.

Lenny (00:44:12):
Classic PM move, just like that was a great idea but what about this better idea? Coming back to something that we talked a bit about at the beginning, say you have a founder who's actually very smart and experienced. Say even at a startup where you don't really have the time to build tons of evidence for ideas. Do you have a different perspective on how much time to spend building confidence in ideas versus just like cool, they actually have really good ideas let's just see what happens?

Itamar Gilad (00:44:41):
So there's always like a trade-off between speed of delivery and speed of discovery, and that actually leads to the next layer of how do we combine the two? Because people tend to think it's an either/or. Either we are building very fast or we are learning and then we're building very slow, but I think we're using the wrong metric. The metric is not how fast can we get the bits into production, when there's a lot of uncertainty and we all face uncertainty and startup especially. It's not about getting the bits to production, it's about getting the right bits to production. It's about creating the outcomes that you need, the impact, and so it's about time to outcomes and I would argue that the evidence guided method is far more impactful. It's far faster, it's far more resource efficient than the opinion-based method. Because opinion-based methods tend to waste a lot more of your resources, building the wrong things or discovering, learning too late. Well, evidence guided helps you learn earlier.

(00:45:50):
Plus it is a fallacy that if you learn you don't build, good teams know how to do both at the same time and that's actually what the steps layer is meant to teach you or to help you do.

Lenny (00:46:03):
Awesome. So maybe just to close off that loop, say someone listening is at a bigger company, say Netflix versus a series A, series B or startup. Is there something you'd recommend about them approaching this differently? Any kind of guidance there of just how to take what you're sharing differently if you're a different source of companies like that?

Itamar Gilad (00:46:23):
Absolutely. I think the concept we talked about of the North Star metric, the value created versus the value captured is very important in every company. Building your entire metrics trees, maybe overkill, doing heavy weighted OKRs may be overkill for early stage. Early stage companies even don't know how they create value, so they need to iterate and their goals is really to find product market fit. Beyond that, what happens is that you need to start building your business model. So that's your goal and you iterate towards that and you need to put metrics on that and then when you move into scale, you need to try to create order because when you scale up... And all of this is covered in the book, there's a special chapter just about these questions. When you scale up, you get a lot of people and a lot of money and everything is happening at the same time. So there you need a order of evaluating ideas in a very systematic way. In a company like Netflix, by the way I don't know if they need this specific method. They're very-

Lenny (00:47:27):
Yeah, maybe that was a bad example. They're probably doing things pretty well.

Itamar Gilad (00:47:30):
One thing I discovered by the way, there's two types of companies that really benefit from this technique. One is those companies that are kind of emerging into modern product development. They have product teams, they have product managers, they have OKRs, they're starting to do Agile. But they're starting to do experimentation, but they're struggling to put it all together. Every CPO is building their own little framework and the other type is those companies that used to be evidence guided and they regressed and that happens way too often. Change of management, change of culture, and then all of a sudden they need to rediscover, to rekindle that spirit that was lost along Google+. So some of the people that actually respond to the strongest are actually surprisingly in these companies.

Lenny (00:48:19):
What I love about your frameworks and kind of all these things we're talking about is these are just a... You can almost think of them as a grab bag set of tools to make you more evidence guided as a company. You could start with thinking about the confidence meter, you could start using ICE more. You could start using the metrics tree and all these things just push you closer and closer to being more evidence guided, you don't have to adopt this whole thing all at once.

Itamar Gilad (00:48:41):
Absolutely. I would recommend that you don't try because if the transformation is way too big, you will get fatigued and you will just create a lot of process for a lot of people and you would not see the results and after a quarter you'll give up. So exactly what you suggested is the right approach.

Lenny (00:48:57):
What would be the first thing you'd suggest if people were trying to move closer to being less opinion oriented and more evidence-based? Which of these frameworks or models would you recommend first?

Itamar Gilad (00:49:06):
I recommend that they discuss internally where is the biggest problem that they're facing. If the goals are unclear, there's misalignment, we keep chasing the wrong things, start at the goals layer. Try to establish your North Star metric, your top business metric, your metrics trees, start assigning teams with their own area of responsibility. If you're spending a lot of time in debates and you're constantly fighting and changing your mind. Start with the ideas there and establish impact is confidence or whatever prioritization model you like, but involve evidence in it. I think the confidence meter is a good tool to use irrespective. If you're building too much and you're not learning enough, start adopting the steps layer which we haven't seen yet and if your team is very disengaged. You have one of these teams where the developers are very into Agile, very into quality, very into launching things, start working on the tasks there.

Lenny (00:50:10):
Awesome. Okay, let's keep going.

Itamar Gilad (00:50:13):
All right, so steps. Steps are about kind of helping us learn and build at the same time as we said and one of the patterns I see is that organizations don't know that they can actually learn at a much lower cost. They believe they need to build this elaborate MVP which is not minimal in any way and then launch it and then they will discover it and basically it's what we used to call beta 20 years ago but just with a different name. What I'm trying to do here in the steps layer is to help companies realize there's a gamut of ways to validate your ideas or more specifically to validate the assumptions in your idea and I created a little model for this, it's called after assessment fact finding, tests, experiments and release results. But again, it's just putting together things that much smarter people invented. So in assessment you have very easy things, things that don't require a lot of work. You check if it aligns with the goals, this idea that you have in your hand.

(00:51:14):
You do maybe some business modeling, you do ICE analysis, you do Assumption Mapping which is great tool by, David J. Blend, or you talk to your stakeholders one-on-one just to see if there are any risks, etc. These are usually not expensive things and they can teach you an awful lot about the impact and the ease of your idea. The next step is to dig data and usually that goes hand in hand with this. So you can find data in your data analysis through surveys, through competitive analysis, through user interviews and through field research, observing your users. Obviously these last two are pretty expensive, so it's often good not to wait until you have the idea and then start doing your research. It's best to keep doing your research ongoing and then you have some sort of data to lie on and to compare your idea against. But until now we didn't build anything, now you're ready to start testing, building versions of the product and putting them in front of users and measuring the results. But initially you don't build anything, you fake it.

(00:52:18):
You do a fake door test, you do a smoke test, Wizard of Oz test, a concierge test, usability test. We used a lot of those in the tabbed inbox by the way, one of the first early versions was actually we showed the tabbed inbox working to people. But it wasn't really Gmail, it was just a facade of HTML and behind the scenes and according to the permissions that the users gave us. Some of us moved just the subject and the sender into the right place. So initially the interviewer distracted them and then showed them their inbox and in it the top 50 messages were sorted to the right place, more or less if we got it right and people were like, "Wow, this is actually very cool." And that gave us a lot of evidence.

Lenny (00:53:02):
That's an awesome story. So that was in the user research, it wasn't rolled out to people? It was a manual individual?

Itamar Gilad (00:53:08):
There wasn't a single line of code written, this was just cooked up by the researchers and our designers. But it gave us some evidence to go and say, we should try and build this thing.

Lenny (00:53:19):
Love that.

Itamar Gilad (00:53:21):
So initially you fake it, mid-level tests are about building a rough version of it, it's not complete, it's not polished, it's not scalable, but it's good enough to give to users to start using. So those are early adopter programs, alphas, longitudinal user studies and fish food. Fish food is testing on your own team.

Lenny (00:53:40):
Fish food? I haven't heard that term before. So it's dog fooding, but more local to your team.

Itamar Gilad (00:53:46):
I think it's a Googly thing, but some people told me that they use fish food as well in their company the name. So I'm using it, I don't know if there's a better name for it.

Lenny (00:53:54):
I wonder why it's called fish food, because it's like little? It's like little gentle little clicks?

Itamar Gilad (00:53:58):
It could be. Yeah, I don't know.

Lenny (00:54:00):
Wow. Okay, super cool. I'm learning a lot here.

Itamar Gilad (00:54:03):
So the next stage is to actually build a kind of more complete version of this and then you can dog food it, then you can give this to your users internally. When I joined Microsoft many years ago, the first thing I noticed was that Outlook was very buggy and I asked people what's going on? And they told me we are all dog fooding the next version of Outlook that hasn't come out yet and that's a very common practice in Silicon Valley. You can do previews, you can do betas, you can do labs, so those are tests. Now, there's a special class of tests which are experiments because they have a control element. So AB tests, multivariate tests, those are all experiments. I'm using the word experiment the way data scientists use it, although people tend to call experiments to everything that you see here and finally, even the release you can do stage release, you can do percent launches, you can do hold backs. All of these things help you further validate your assumptions. Sometimes you need to roll back and change things, but it's another opportunity to learn.

(00:55:06):
So the key point is you don't have to start at the right-hand side, which is expensive. You can start early on and that leads to poking a lot of ideas very quickly. You realize they're not as good as you thought, and then you can invest more effort into the good ideas. If they generate positive evidence, you can go further and further until that point where you feel you're ready for delivery.

Lenny (00:55:29):
Okay. So we've talked about goals, we've talked about ideas, we're talking about steps here. Is there anything else along steps? And then next I know comes tasks.

Itamar Gilad (00:55:37):
No, this is it for steps. There's a lot more with this, we will not go into all of it.

Lenny (00:55:42):
Okay, that sounds good. Let's talk about tasks and what you mean there.

Itamar Gilad (00:55:46):
All right, awesome. So in many organizations there's these two worlds. There's the planning world where basically you have the managers, the stakeholders, some of the PMs really sit and think about what we need to launch and that's where we create the strategies and the roadmaps and the projects. But guess who is not invited to the party? The people who are actually doing the work. They live in Agile world, they're very focused on moving tickets to the done state, on completing burning story points, pushing stuff into production and there's a big gap between these two worlds. They don't understand each other, they don't see eye to eye, there's a lot of mistrust being built sometimes against the plans or the managers feels that the teams are just not being very effective. We've seen all of this and the solution, the stop gap is to put a PM in the middle. The PM is supposed to make all of this work, deliver on the roadmap like a project manager, feed the Agile machine with perfectly prioritized product backlogs and stories and it just doesn't work honestly.

(00:56:50):
And the PMs I meet are very tired and they have to spend so much time in planifications and roadmap discussions and they're very busy, they don't have time to do research or to test ideas. So I suggest changing this and bringing the developers a little bit out of their Agile cage if you like and no disrespect to Agile, it's a great thing but let's let them do more than just develop. Let's let them discover as well and one of the tools I suggest and again this is a process is what I call the GIST board. So it's basically the top three layers of GIST. The goals are on the right, these are just the key results usually per team I suggest not more than four. So you create a GIST board per team, then the ideas we're working on right now sometimes with our ICE scores and then the next few steps that we might want to pursue in order to validate these ideas and this is a very dynamic thing.

(00:57:48):
It changes all the time, the team leads need to update it and the team needs to meet around it at least once every other week to think to talk about what's going on. Are we still following the right ideas? How are we doing on the goals? What are the next steps? What's blocking us from completing the most important steps? And this is a discussion that is not happening today, because most of the discussion happens at the roadmap level and then there's a lot of discussion at the task level. But this middle layer of what actually are we trying to achieve and how well are we doing on it doesn't exist. If you do have this, you create a lot more context in the minds of your team and then they need to ask you fewer questions. You need to tell them less what to do. They know what's success and they are able to actually do a lot more on their own.

Lenny (00:58:37):
Is the way to think about the GIST board as the way you should be road roadmapping or is this more of a strategy framework to think about why you should be prioritizing broadly?

Itamar Gilad (00:58:48):
The way I say this is at the beginning of the quarter, the team defines its goals. The leads of the team define the goals, but they review it with the team, they review it with the managers, of course with the stakeholders. Everyone's in agreement, these are the maximum four key results and the one or two objectives you guys need to work on, teams cannot deliver on more than that. You copy these key results into the GIST board, then you start looking at your idea bank or you start generating ideas and say, how can we achieve these key results?

Lenny (00:59:18):
And to clarify the thing you copy is the key result as the goal?

Itamar Gilad (00:59:22):
Yes, exactly. You can write the objectives alongside that to remind people what are we trying to achieve, but the key results are the thing we show here. Then you pick some ideas, the ones that look most promising and as unintuitive as it sounds or counterintuitive as this sounds I would recommend that you let the team pick these ideas. The manager of the stakeholders can propose the ideas, everyone can propose, but the team should use the ICE process to kind of... And especially the product manager is very important here to choose which ideas to test first. Then the team together needs to develop which steps should we run, how can we validate this? Some of the steps will be done by the PM, some by the data analyst, some by the user researcher. But some will involve the team, there'll be some coding, there'll be some running of experiments and so there's some ownership around the steps. A sub team owns each one of these steps and we will change the board very actively.

(01:00:24):
So if an idea turns out to be bad we will take it off the board and put another idea in this place or maybe we achieve the goal, we don't need to work on this anymore, we can focus something else. So it's a project management tool in a sense.

Lenny (01:00:36):
Awesome. So I'm looking at it and I think maybe the most important piece of this is that steps aren't just like a project, like launch a better onboarding or add the step to onboarding. It's you want to emphasize the steps that you're going to take to get to more and more confidence essentially, and more and more evidence guided thinking versus just, "Well, let's figure out how to launch this feature idea."

Itamar Gilad (01:01:03):
Exactly. It's not a engineering milestone or a design milestone, it's a learning milestone. So we build something and along the way we actually grow the scope of what we build. We are building the product in the process and we learn, so the two have to come hand in hand.

Lenny (01:01:20):
And for folks that aren't watching this on YouTube, just to walk through an example, we'll do it real quick. So one of your goals here is average onboarding time, you want your goal to be the average onboarding time less than two days, currently five and a half days. An idea there is an onboarding wizard, and then the steps are a usability test with mockups and then a usability test as a prototype and then an AB test?

Itamar Gilad (01:01:42):
Yeah, basically, and you can alter this as you go along. Sometimes you can run multiple steps in parallel it's not always sequential. But that's basically the process, yeah.

Lenny (01:01:53):
Awesome. So again, what you're trying to emphasize here as a team is just we're not just going to launch this onboarding wizard and we're not going to figure it out later. It's like let's be upfront about the steps we're going to take to build more and more confidence. This is something we should keep investing more and more in, which is really interesting.

Itamar Gilad (01:02:09):
Yeah, and another interesting thing that happens every time you run a step if it's successful you have evidence and you can go back to the managers and tell them and share and say, "With this idea we thought it was great, but we got this result. What do you think that means?" And sometimes that manager that propose it would say, "I think the test failed, let's rerun it." Or sometimes they will say, "Maybe it's not as strong as I thought. The discussion just becomes that much more nuanced and objective if you like.

Lenny (01:02:42):
Maybe just to close out this framework. How does this relate to a roadmap that they may have in a spreadsheet or in Jira or in Asana or something like that. Does this sit on top of that? Is this replacing a roadmap somewhere else?

Itamar Gilad (01:02:54):
I would say that release roadmaps where you are just saying by Q3 we want to launch this or by October we have to launch that, they're kind of competing with this. If you're doing that and people know that the goal is to launch that thing by October, forget about learning, forget about evidence guided, I recommend using outcome roadmaps saying by October we want to achieve this outcome. By Q4 we want to launch in another three countries, or we want to grow our usage in India by that much, by this time we need to tackle the problem of churn and how we achieve this. Sometimes we know we have a concrete idea that is high confidence that we already tested, we switch into delivery, then we can put it on the roadmap and say, "Yeah, we're going to build this thing and we'll aim for October." But otherwise you want to keep it open and the roadmaps can kind of suffocate this process if you decide upfront with low confidence that this particular idea must be launched.

Lenny (01:04:04):
Okay. So you're proposing people switch the roadmapping practice to this, which is very ambitious. I love it.

Itamar Gilad (01:04:10):
Well, this is not a roadmap. This is just a tool for the team to manage the project, but I have a proposal for outcome roadmaps inside the book.

Lenny (01:04:20):
Okay, awesome. Okay. So I was going to ask if people wanted to try this approach, the book is the best way to fully understand the framework and how implement it.

Itamar Gilad (01:04:30):
That's one way. I have articles, I have resources on my site, but I try to condense much of what we just discussed in a lot more nuance in the book. So if you are interested in that, I would give it a go.

Lenny (01:04:45):
Awesome. Maybe just on the topic of OKRs real quick. How do OKRs connect to all this? It sounds like broadly you kind of assume people will keep working on here's our metric or key results or objectives and then that plugs into this kind of GIST framework.

Itamar Gilad (01:05:01):
So the metrics trees, plus your mission, plus the individual missions of the teams give you most of what you need to populate your OKRs. There's of course a process of alignment, top down, bottom up, side to side, which I talk a little bit about as well. OKRs is a very rich topic, but those things are usually the core. There's usually some other OKRs that's about the health of the company, the health of the product, etc. Those are called supplementary OKRs, I talk about those as well. So yeah, I think OKRs are a helpful tool if you like them.

Lenny (01:05:37):
And just zooming out again. Basically you don't need to take all of these ideas and lump them all together and change the way you work as a business. You can start with picking some of these ideas and starting to become more and more evidence guided. It sounds like this GIST board isn't where you probably want to start, but maybe it's once you have more and more experience using some of these tools or you tell me. Do you sometimes go straight to this way of thinking about the roadmap and the plan?

Itamar Gilad (01:06:04):
So it might not be the full board because you're missing some of the pieces, maybe your goals are not as good or your idea prioritization isn't as good. But if your team is very, very delivery focused and sometimes it's also the opposite. The managers are telling them how to build and you want to break this kind of dynamic, you want to create a step backlog. So instead of a product backlog, let's create a backlog of steps which are just validation steps, betas and previews, etc, and that changes the dynamic pretty strongly.

Lenny (01:06:39):
So by the time this podcast comes out, the book will be out. What is the best place to find the book?

Itamar Gilad (01:06:44):
Hopefully on Amazon, you can search for it. You can go to my site, itamargilad.com and it'll be presented prominently there and there's also the book landings page where you'll find everything you need to know about the book, evidenceguided.com.

Lenny (01:06:59):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Itamar Gilad (01:07:03):
Yes, let's go.

Lenny (01:07:04):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Itamar Gilad (01:07:07):
So I'm going to cheat, I'm going to recommend a series of books so two series. One is the-

Lenny (01:07:12):
Cheating is allowed.

Itamar Gilad (01:07:13):
All right, cool. One, and those are obvious one. One is the series published by SVPG, Silicon Valley Product Group. So INSPIRED, EMPOWERED, now I think TRANSFORMED has come out, I haven't read it yet but I'm sure it's amazing. So this is Marty Cagan and his colleagues, they write some tremendous books and every product manager should read them. The other series, a bit older, this is the Lean series, The Lean Startup, Lean Enterprise, Lean Analytics, there's gold in all these books, Lean UX, really, really important books and I think they're not as appreciated as they should. Running Lean, that's another example.

Lenny (01:07:54):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Itamar Gilad (01:07:57):
I'm not really a big TV or movie buff, I just put on whatever comes up. I'm discovering that YouTube is actually becoming one of my sources of information entertainment. I'm learning a lot of Spanish recently, so I discovered this channel called Dreaming Spanish which is if you're learning Spanish it's incredible. So that's my recommendation.

Lenny (01:08:19):
That's a unique choice, I love it. Favorite interview question you like to ask candidates.

Itamar Gilad (01:08:24):
I like to ask them to design something for a niche audience. So a navigation system for elderly people or some sort of laptop for people with vision impairment, etc. So those are good questions to see their customer empathy, their creativity, their ability to evaluate multiple ideas, their ability to find flaws in their own ideas. So there's a lot of room to dig in there and kind of see how this person is thinking as a product person.

Lenny (01:08:57):
What is a favorite product you recently discovered that you love?

Itamar Gilad (01:09:00):
It's a cliche, but it's AI. There's a company called ElevenLabs, that do voices and the best voices, synthetic voices you heard, but they can also replicate your own voice so you can create a voice signature. If you're American you can use their kind of default free version or cheap version to replicate your own voice and that could be pretty useful if you need to narrate an audiobook or do some online course. So I'm finding this service very interesting.

Lenny (01:09:36):
This is all part of my big retirement plan, find all of these components together that can replace me eventually. You got AI generating content, we'll have this voice thing. I love it, it's all happening.

Itamar Gilad (01:09:45):
There's an AI version of you, right? I can ask you questions now with-

Lenny (01:09:48):
Oh, there is lennybot.com.

Itamar Gilad (01:09:50):
Right.

Lenny (01:09:51):
It's all part of the plan. Okay. What is a favorite life motto that you repeat most to yourself that you share with others?

Itamar Gilad (01:09:59):
That's a big one. Albert Einstein I think said, "Strive not to be a success, but to be of value." And I think that's a great motto for people and for companies. It's something that kind of guides me and this whole concept of the value exchange, etc, is kind of loosely connected to that.

Lenny (01:10:19):
I love that, that's such a important point for people putting out content online. So many people are just like, I just want to be successful, get followers, here's all these things I'm tweeting and showing and the thing that actually works is deliver value, create valuable stuff that people really value and want. I find the signal for that is, do you find it interesting and valuable? If you're like, "Oh wow, that's really interesting." Oftentimes other people are going to find it interesting. So I love that, great choice, I'm going to look at that one up. Two more questions. What's the most valuable lesson you learned from your mom or your dad?

Itamar Gilad (01:10:53):
I think both of them in their own way, they had relatively modest jobs, teaching or doing other things, but they always strived again to be the best they can and to deliver the most value they can. So it's very connected somehow, maybe I'm seeing the world through this lens. But they kind of taught me to strive to be the best I can at what I do.

Lenny (01:11:19):
The final question, you're Israeli for folks that can't tell. What is your favorite Israeli food that people should definitely check out or I try to get whenever they can?

Itamar Gilad (01:11:29):
When I arrive in Israel I usually go for shawarma, which is like döner kebab if you know it, it's just better. So if you're in Israel, if you go visit Haifa, which is the city where I grew up definitely check out the shawarma.

Lenny (01:11:44):
Awesome. Itamar, I hope people got the gist of your book from our conversation. What's the best way to find it? What's the best way to learn about you and reach out if they want to ask any questions? And then also, how can listeners be useful to you?

Itamar Gilad (01:11:56):
To find it you can go to itamargilad.com or to evidenceguided.com, and you'll find a book and you'll find me. Best value to me, try it out, just take some of these ideas, bring them back to your office, talk with your colleagues, say what do you think we should do about this? Just give it a go and reach back to me, tell me I'm easy to find in my website. Tell me what happened I'm really interested.

Lenny (01:12:22):
Amazing. Itamar, thank you again so much for being here.

# Behind the product: Duolingo streaks | Jackson Shuttleworth (Group PM, Retention Team)

## Transcript

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:00):
... Duolingo is a $14 billion company, it's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up, but I think it doubled in value in the past six months. Streaks is the most impactful feature. We have, right now, over 9 million users with a year plus streak. If you look at the numbers, I think it's been our biggest growth lever. What Duolingo really focuses on is, how do we help users build habits around language learning? Getting user come back the next day is the biggest problem to solve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
Let's get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:30):
I'd say test everything, we've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the streaks, so every other day. We've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. We used to say continue, our standard CTA is continue, and we changed that to commit to my goal, and it was a massive win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
There's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:55):
Say that you played a mobile game, or that you've done it for 3,000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today, my guest is Jackson Shuttleworth. Jackson is a group product manager at Duolingo, leading the retention team. This is a different kind of episode that I'm experimenting with, where we spent the entire conversation focused on the journey and lessons of a single feature, in this case, Duolingo streaks. Duolingo is a $14 billion business, just over the past six months, they doubled in value, they're hitting all time highs in usage and market cap, they're also one of the very few successful and also the single biggest consumer app business in the world. And as you'll hear from Jackson, the streaks feature is the single most impactful feature that most contributed to this growth and success. In other words, you could argue this one feature created billions of dollars of value, which to me means it is worth studying in depth.

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, Jackson shares the history of the streaks feature, all of the biggest wins and wrong turns they've taken along the way, what he and his team have learned about what works and doesn't work with a streaks mechanic, and also how they set up their teams to operate in a way that allows them to run over 600 experiments on this product and continue to find big wins. I hope to do more episodes like this on features and products that you'd love to hear more about, so leave a comment either on YouTube or on Substack, and tell me which product or feature you'd love to see me cover. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jackson Shuttleworth.

(00:02:44):
Jackson, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:02:48):
Yeah, thank you. Long time listener, first time caller.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):
I appreciate it. So, this is going to be a really interesting conversation, I've never done an episode like this before, where we basically spent an hour, an hour and a half going into one feature of one product, but this is a very special feature, it's a very special product. Have you ever spent an hour, an hour and a half just talking about this one feature with anyone?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:03:13):
Well, internally, so when we onboard new folks to the team, we'll do, I actually just did this with somebody that joined the team recently, where we spent, yeah, I was like, hey, let's spend an hour just talking about the streak. We got through an hour and I got through about 30% of what I wanted to share, there's just so much, we'll talk about this, but there's so much that we've learned over the years, but never anything externally like this. I think we've shared bits and pieces of learnings, but this will be the motherload of learnings hopefully-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:14):
Here we go.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:03:41):

(00:06:03):
Okay, so for people that don't know anything about what Duolingo streaks are, can you just first give a brief explanation of what is Duolingo streaks? What is this feature all about?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:06:10):
Well, presumably people know, Duolingo is a language learning app, the Duolingo streak tracks, currently anyway, how many days in a row you've done a lesson. So, you come to Duolingo, you do a lesson, your first lesson you'll start a streak, and then every consecutive day that you come use the app, you'll extend your streak. And I should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility into the feature. So, we have these things called streak freezes, it's like insurance for your streaks. So, it's a pretty simple feature, in theory, but over time we've layered on challenges, and goal setting, and rewards, and social features... A lot of our notifications are tied to the streak. So, pretty simple feature to understand, but it's been a really rich feature for us to build on top of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
Some people might be hearing this and be like, Duolingo streaks, what's the big deal? There's other people that are like, holy, I want to learn everything I can possibly learn about Duolingo streaks, so many companies are trying to copy what you've learned from this. Give people a sense of the impact that this one feature has had on Duolingo's success and growth.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:07:15):
And this is not just the subjective retention PM talking, I think this is our biggest feature, with the exception of the lessons. And I think it's actually [inaudible 00:07:24] start that. Streaks are a great engagement hack. I'm of the opinion that any team, any app out there can introduce a streak, and if you figure it out, it probably works to retain users, but at the core, you have to have an app that people want to use, and people really like using Duolingo. It's fun, it's delightful, you learn something. And so, it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that the streak is really powerful. So, it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs, again, it is one of our golden geese. And again, what's cool is that, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. Us sending better, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work because they reference the streak, because users care about the streak.

(00:08:10):
And so, not only is it itself, us iterating on the streak a huge driver of DAUs, but it's also something that enables other really high valuable features. I was looking up some stats before I came on, and it's pretty crazy. So, we have right now over 9 million users with a year plus streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:30):
Wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:08:30):
So, 9 million of our users have used Duolingo every year, almost every day, for well over a year. Which is pretty... I don't know, I like to imagine things in terms of like, okay, well, if you put all these people in a city, or in a place, where would it be? I'm like, ah, it's like a very large city, 9 million people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):
For a year, have a year long streak.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:08:53):
For a year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
That's incredible. I was just looking at the stock of Duolingo, so Duolingo is a $14 billion company at the time we're recording this. It's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up. I think it doubled in value in the past six months, something like that. And what I'm hearing from you is streaks is, other than just the core learning feature, which is just the product of Duolingo, this is the most feature in terms of growth, and in that retention specifically.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:09:24):
If you look at the numbers, I think pretty objectively has been our biggest growth lever for driving DAUs, and also say a lot of it's just related to how we think about growth at Duolingo. And a lot of what we try to do is organic growth. We think about growth just as much as bringing new users onto the platform is not losing them. If you're just bringing people onto the platform, then they churn, that's not going to be sustainable. And so, as much as we can do to keep our users coming back and actually retaining as users, it's going to give us a much easier base to continue growing DAUs off of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):
Perfect. Okay. Talk about how this feature originally came to be. What was the original version of it? What was the original insight that led to [inaudible 00:10:05]-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:10:04):
Yeah, so the oldest streaks or as old as Duolingo itself. When we launched Duolingo, we launched with a streak... And I say we, I was just graduating undergrad when Duolingo launched. So, this is well before my time. But we launched with a streak feature. Initially how the feature worked was you'd come to Duolingo and you'd set a goal for yourself, and it was an XP based goal. So, Duolingo, a little bit of nomenclature, we have an experience point based system that drives a lot of our features in the app. And the way you'd set it is you'd say, based on what your language learning goal was, maybe you have a 10 experience point goal versus a 50 experience point goal. And so, extending your streak would be, hey, can you hit 50 experience points? If that's what you set your goal to be.

(00:10:50):
And this worked well, I think this also speaks to how Duolingo initially grew. Luis launched it with a TEDTalk, we probably had a more tech-forward user base initially, and so this whole idea of an experience points based streak system made sense. But what that also meant is that you could have a user come and use the app, do multiple lessons a day, and maybe they just set too hard of a goal for themselves, and then lose their streak. Which, you don't need to be an expert in streaks to understand that's probably not good. The nice thing with how we initially set it up though is it really did connect with what your goal was. So, if you were serious, let's track how good you are at being a serious language learner.

(00:11:28):
But I'd say one of the most impactful experiments we ran was about, this was actually as I was joining, or just after I joined we had run this experiment, was to move it from a XP based streak to just do one lesson a day, and you'd extend your streak. And the risk that you can sort of imagine is, well, then users kind of care less about it because it's not connected with their goal. And we saw none of that. This was a huge driver of DAUs, just making it easier to extend your streak, but I think really importantly it's still meaningful. The unit of use, and as you're thinking about building a streak, I think it's really important to think about what the unit of use of your app is. The unit of use for Duolingo is doing a lesson. And so, if what we care about is users coming back every day and doing a lesson, because it shows that they're actually engaging with the app, then it doesn't hurt us to make our streak focus on just do one unit versus multiple.

(00:12:23):
And so, that was probably the big [inaudible 00:12:25] change experiment that we ran at the time was moving from an XP-based streak to a one lesson streak. It's also simple, and I think that's one of the things to think about with streaks. It's always easy as a PM to have a million goals or objectives for what you want your feature to be and potentially build a more complex feature, and a one lesson streak, it's just easy for more users to understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. And just for folks that aren't super familiar with XP, it's basically experience points and you get them from doing things, it's like a [inaudible 00:12:53]-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:12:53):
Yeah, you do stuff on Duolingo, and then based on what you did and how well you did it, we give you experience points, this actually drives a number of our features in our apps. So, leaderboards is the big one, we have a leaderboard system, where you try over the course of the week, you battle with 29 other people, and you want to win, that's all driven by XP. So, we do have other features in the app that really benefit from this XP system-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:16):
Cool.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:13:16):
... the streak is just no longer one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Awesome. Okay, so I want to talk about the journey from that point to what it is today, but a quick tangent, I saw Luis tweet just this week, someone asked him, "How do you decide whether to optimize for learning or engagement?" And he's like, "No question, everything we do is focused on engagement because you won't learn anything if you're not coming back to the app."

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:13:39):
As an engagement PM, that was the coolest thing he could have ever said. It's, well, again, very much as subjectively I guess as an engagement PM, that's how I've... I am sure the learning folks at Duolingo will cringe when they hear it, I see myself as a learning PM as much as an engagement PM, because the easiest way not to learn on Duolingo is not to come back the next day. And so, if we don't make the app retentive, you will have no opportunity to engage with our learning features. Now, I do think that there is a long tail of learning, where, if you start to dumb down, and honestly this is something we wrestle with the streak as well, you start to dumb down the experience, and your users aren't actually learning, they're not going to care.

(00:14:20):
Streaks work best when they're sitting on top of an app that users care about. But yeah, if you don't come learn on Duolingo.... If you don't come back to Duolingo, then you're not learning. We track a lot of this with, the work that we do, we make sure that as we're making changes to the streak, we're not hurting the learning experience and we don't have a ton of interaction with it. So, we're constantly thinking about this, but thank you Luis for saying that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
It makes sense to me. Okay, so lets get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks. So, the first version went from XP to one lesson, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way to what we see today.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:15:03):
Duolingo has very much, has a strong test it philosophy, we're willing to test a lot of different... Honestly, we'd much rather test it than debate it for days and days. So, we actually followed up this experiment with, and this is a little bit later, with hey, what if we make it even easier to extend your streak? And so, we actually tested, hey, if you do one exercise, just one exercise in a lesson will extend your streak. A lot of the insight was good, you look at the funnel, hey, there's a lot of users who are starting but not finishing lessons, they're not extending your streak, the loss aversion doesn't kick in, they don't come back... So, this followed that train of thought. What we realized when we ran this experiment is DAUs moved not one bit. And what we were doing by... And if we go back to unit of measure, we had dumbed down the unit of... Nobody thinks about, oh, I just want to come do one question on Duolingo, nobody thinks about that.

(00:16:05):
So, we had a less clear unit of measure that we were basing our streak around, and the users that we were capturing with our streak, you come, you do one or two questions on Duolingo, then you leave, were the least engaged users imaginable. And so, I think that's something also to think about as you're building your streak, is like what is the user that you're solving for? So, not only what is the habit that you're building for, but what is the level of commitment, and that was an example where we over indexed on a type of user who we honestly just weren't going to keep, that was a very easy shutdown decision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:39):
That's an awesome story, just to comment in that real quick. Just you went, let's just go to the extreme and make it just like streaks, yeah, get everyone going streaks forever, and then... I love that it turned out and it's not bringing users that you want, and it's dumbing down experience. It makes me think of Farmville, where you have to go and harvest your crops every, whatever, hour, that lasts for a bit and then eventually people are like, what the hell am I doing with my life?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:17:04):
Yeah, exactly. We test every, I was looking at the numbers as well, we've run in the last four years, over 600 experiments on the streaks. So, every other day effectively-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):
600, wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:17:15):
... we're running an experiment. And they range from big, like this, changing how the mechanic works, to let's swap a string with another string and see if that copy is better for users. So, we're constantly testing on everything. I do think that, I'd be more careful running that experiment now, at some point your streak gets big enough that, again, I got 9 million users on the streak, I got to be really careful... Those are our best retaining users, you got to be careful. But in the early days of the streak, I'd say test everything. See what... Don't get super caught up in it has to be like this, just test a bunch of stuff and see what speaks most to users. Because I think, again, you will constantly be surprised by the insights that you get from whether you... We shut down about half of our experiments, so half of our experiments lose, we still learned a ton by virtue of running them. So, super, super valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:08):
That's actually a good success rate, a lot of companies have only 20% of experiments be positive. What's your policy on if it's neutral, do you ship it, or do you kill it?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:18:18):
It really depends. If we're adding something and it's neutral, we tend to shut it down because it's just more cognitive load, it's something that we're going to have to start building around, a new UI element that we have to figure out how it fits into our system. I'd say when we do ship a neutral experiment is, something that we have real conviction around, okay, yeah, maybe this was neutral but it's going to give us a new platform to then build on top of, so that experience might be neutral, but now we can build these DAU positive experiments. My general take there is though, in that case, build that in as part of your V1 so that you make sure that at least your hypothesis around this roadmap has play should probably be the case, but in general, shutting down a neutral experiment so you don't introduce more complexity to the app is the way we tend to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
Makes sense. All right, what else? What else have you learned along the journey?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:19:13):
Well, maybe I can talk about a few different ways that we structure, a few different themes that I think we lean on. So, the first is focusing on the zero to seven day user experience. And I would say this is, if you look at whatever our breakdown of experiments are, we run definitely more than average number of experiments on getting users to go from a zero to seven day streak. And a lot of this is because we've looked at the data for our retention curves, and what we found is that once you get to seven days, loss aversion kicks in, and you retain. So, going from a one to a two-day streak, huge jump in retention, two to three day streak, slightly less but still huge and it's up until day seven. Once you hit day seven, it flans out. And it's not to say that if you have a 30-day streak, you're way more attentive than day seven, but not in the order of magnitude that it is from day one through seven.

(00:20:05):
So, we do a ton of work to get users to that point where loss aversion kicks in, and then they don't want to lead the app. One of the fun ones that we did, and it's honestly as much about process as it is about the feature itself, was we have a feature called streak goal, and it is... Again, so much of this stuff seems so obvious in retrospect, but it was really novel at the time. We had this idea of like, hey, maybe we'll just goal users to hitting a certain streak length. As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful user psychology, and we started with the simplest version of this. And this is how Duolingo does a lot of our testing. Rather than design the big complex feature for V1, just do the simplest encapsulation of what that feature can be, see if it has legs, and then just add to it iteratively over time, this is partially how we get to 600+ experiments on streaks, they're not all big ones.

(00:21:01):
But we started... And it was funny, we actually took a learning from our monetization win teams. One of the strings that they had, the pieces of copy that they had, worked really, really well was, I think it was your 5.6 x more likely to finish the course if you subscribe to Plus. Now, it's Super, our subscription. It was a really good hook that if you really cared, you'd sign up. And so, we had a similar thought, where it's like, oh, let's just tell you how much more likely you are to finish the course if you get a 30-day streak.

(00:21:34):
And so, we started with that, and I think it was like you're seven times more likely to finish the course if you have a 30-day streak, and just that message when you started your streak, I telling you that, was awesome. Huge win. Indicating an outcome... And Duolingo doesn't have, we have a gem economy but we don't actually have, it's all you learning. But being able to actually talk about it in terms of the outcomes that a user would think about, in this case, trying to finish the course, was a huge win. So, this is where we started and we're like, ah, goal setting, all right, we should go much harder on this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:06):
Found a-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:22:06):
Yeah, we found our thing, and now let's just beat the heck out of it. So, we followed that up with another experiment, where we tested different lengths. So, we test 14 days and 50 days, and we found that they were all good, but they appealed to different users. And so, we started to realize, all right, well, we probably need to be more thoughtful about who we give these different options to. And so, then we followed that experiment up with, all right, let's start with 30 days, and then we're going to let you opt out, we'll say, no, I don't think I can hit it. And our thinking was, and then if you say no, we'll hit you with an easier goal. Because we just wanted to get you to commit to a goal. And this was a fascinating one because it was a good win to give users that easier goal, to try to capture them before they said no, but it was almost just as big a win to add that opt out button.

(00:22:58):
So, we tested separately, and I'm a huge fan of testing way too many arms for an experiment, just to be able to isolate your hypotheses, but we captured just what happens if we add an opt-out button, and adding an opt-out button... And you would think, as a PM, oh, now users might not engage with my feature, that's a bad thing, but it was a huge win to let them do that. And the learning here was that this intentionality of saying, no, I want it... Previously it was just a continue button, but now it's like, no, I want to hit 30 days, and having that be an intentional decision for them, yes or no, even though again, this had no impact, or no impact past this screen. Everything that I'm talking about now was just that screen that day, and then was all thrown out. So, that optionality was a huge insight, and so because of that, we built a goal setting feature where you could choose between different goals, giving users that optionality was likewise a huge win.

(00:23:57):
I'll say one final learning on this, again, you talk about friction, and good and bad friction, we thought once we built a goal picker screen, where you could pick between different streak lengths, we were like, oh, well, let's recommend that users do a harder goal, thinking that okay, well, a harder goal is going to be better retention, and we'll the preselect harder goal for them. And based on all the learnings that I just shared with you, you probably imagine lost pretty significantly, we realized that yes, we could speed users through the screen more by virtue of picking a goal for them, but that act of selecting, I think it's 30 days, I think it's 14 days, was where we were getting so much of the engagement from this feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
There's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates, it feels like you guys should write a book on human psychology and motivation.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:24:51):
I feel very much like a amateur armchair psychologist with everything that, at least as far as people who want to learn languages on their phone go, I really understand those folks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:03):
Right. So, one theme I'm hearing here so far is you guys are basically just mining for gold, just looking for a vein in some mine, and once you hit it you're like, ooh, this worked, you just go crazy on just testing all kinds of things to see how far you can take that one little thread.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:25:22):
Yeah, and I think, I shared how this idea came partially from a monetization win that they had, I think there's a lot of, because Duolingo runs... I don't know what percentile we're in, but it's got to be a very high percentile of per capita experiments run for a company, based on company size. We're just constantly learning so many things and there's a really great cross-sharing of monetization say, hey, this thing worked for us, is that something you can use? So, I'd say it's rare that we go into something where it's just like, let's just try something. Typically, we have some insight because of all of these experiments that we've run, that hey, if we do this, I don't know, it's one here, or it's worked here, it's driven this user engagement, if we massage that and try in this scenario, or a different screen, we come in at least with a strong hypothesis of this will work.

(00:26:17):
A lot of times we do look, and we're like, a lot of the apps that we look at actually are games themselves, so it's like, all right, you're playing Royal Match, or there's the new Pokemon trading card game that I'm spending way too much time on, you look at these games and see what they're doing, and it's really good fodder for what we can do. But a lot of times you're at least going in with a strong hypothesis based on what you've seen work elsewhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):
Got it. So, just to double down on that point, it's not just random experiments, it's here's a hypothesis we're fairly confident, or has a chance to be true, let's try it. It's not just let's just try everything?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:26:49):
Yeah. And I think that how strongly you feel about the hypothesis directly ties to how hard that experiment is. With copy, for instance, we've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. I'm of the opinion that companies should run, as long as you have the user base to do it, copy test constantly. The amount of copy tests that we've had that have won, and I don't know, you just try things and you figure out what wins is definitely legion, and [inaudible 00:27:15] massive wins from little copy changes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):
Is there an example of that, of just the impact?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:27:20):
Going back to that goal screen, we used to say Continue, our standard CTA is Continue, and we changed that to Commit To My Goal, and it was a massive win. And again, it was like, okay, users tapping on that, what are we asking them to do? Commit to the goal, what is that going to lead them to do? Commit, not churn. Just that little copy change, that one time, right there, led to huge wins. And copy changes are so cheap, it's just you translate, for us, we have a lot of users all over the world, and a lot of UI languages, but just come up with a bunch of ideas, translate some strings... This is one where the feedback that you'll typically get from Luis. So, all of our changes at Duolingo go through product review that are reviewed by Luis, so Luis reviews every single change that we propose, every experiment that we run.

(00:28:12):
Typically with copy, he's just like, I don't know, test it, there's nothing better than be told by Luis, I don't think this is going to win, but sure, if you want to. And a lot of times, to his credit, he's right, and a lot of times our intuition was right, but it's just so cheap to do it. I think when the lift is smaller, it's great to have a hypothesis, but you don't need to beat it up too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:36):
So, on this thread, I didn't realize Louis reviews everything you're planning to change, and this may be the answer to the question I was going to ask, which is, one of the criticisms of running a product and company this way, of just experimenting constantly with all these micro improvements and changes, is it can lead to something, like a monstrosity of a product and experience that isn't consistent and cohesive, and just that often happens. Is the solution to that having the founder basically review all the changes? Is there anything else y'all do to avoid it becoming Farmville or whatever, is a good example of that?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:29:06):
Yeah, our product review structure where we've got our head of product design, one of the lead, the product management leaders, and then Luis, NPR. And because they see everything, and they have a really high product bar, and so that helps. I think over time we just, as PMs, have to look at, okay, where is our feature headed? And so, we do this with the streak at least on a quarterly basis, to look at, okay, well, what have we learned, how has our streak developed, and how do we imagine this going in near future? It's easy to do, and in some sort of awful local maxima, if you're not constantly looking at your roadmap and you don't have a clear strategy. For me it's like, if you have a clear strategy where your feature is going, hopefully all of those A/B tests are not just done to get some cheap gain, they're done with a long-term goal in mind.

(00:30:03):
I do think though, and we do this every now and then with the streak, eventually you just hit a local maxima, and you say, you talked about launching neutral experiments, this is a great example, where it's like all right, cool, now we need to throw a bunch of this stuff out, based on all the learnings, can we reset this real estate, can we reset this UI, reset this feature, in such a way that is just as good as what we have now but is way more plain or simple, that we can, again, start to layer on? Those are really hard experiments to get to win obviously, because they are so optimized, but they're really important to do, otherwise, yeah, you just end up with a kitchen sink of a feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):
One other tidbit I just want to mention, an advantage you all have that other companies don't have is people want to learn a language, and so getting pushed to come back to an app for something that they want to do, it's not an advantage a lot of products have. So, anything you want to add there, of just like this is why Duolingo might be a little different from what you're working on.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:31:03):
That is definitely a benefit, if I had an app... And that this is actually why I think a lot of mobile games do streaks differently, because to say that you played a mobile game, and as somebody who plays a lot of mobile games, that you've done it for 3000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3000 days in a row. I think the comparison set is much larger though, than a lot of companies give themselves credit for, and I think that there's... There's a lot of ways that companies think about their... There are very few companies I imagine out there in the world saying, oh, we don't do some degree of good for our users... Even if it's like a game, it's like, I don't know, you're giving somebody a moment away from the craziness of their lives.

(00:31:47):
And so, I do think though that is contingent on companies who are going to figure out if a streak works for them, to figure out how can you frame the streak in such a way that a user does feel good about it. And it's easier for a Duolingo, but I think there's creative ways to phrase this for users. The other thing maybe just on that that I'll say is, the streak works really well for Duolingo because with language learning it's really hard to see day-to-day progress in becoming more fluent. And fluency is not even the right word, it's like becoming better at Spanish or whatever, it is a years long process for someone to get better at a language.

(00:32:25):
Duolingo makes it easier, but you still got to put in thousands of hours if you're going to reach C1 or C2 fluency, and that is really hard to track on a day-to-day, and so the streak works really well for us because we might not be able to tell you, hey, you now know 0.01% more Spanish, but we can show you, hey, you've gotten your streak a little bit higher. And so, I think this works particularly well when you're an app that is doing something that's going to be sensed or felt over a longer term to help contextualize that progress in a way that makes more sense, or at least feels more tangible to a user.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:02):
Great, that was a great context. Empowering to a lot of companies that aren't necessarily doing language learning. Okay. So, it took us on a long tangent away from lessons and experiments you ran along the journey of iterating on the streak. So, a few things you've shared so far is just, it started with this XP idea, and then went to a lesson, then you iterated on ways to make it simpler, maybe harder, you added streak goals, where you commit to I'm going to hit a certain goal of streak. What else? What else have you found that has worked, didn't work, lessons learned?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:33:32):
Again, sticking with this one to seven day streak, the idea of a streak, particularly probably to this audience, is obvious. Like, oh, it's a streak, it just counts how many days. We've realized over time that a lot of users do not understand how a streak works, and it can be as small as, well, I don't understand how streak freezes work, or I don't... Like my mom the other day was talking to you about it, she's like, "Oh, I didn't use Duolingo and I come back and my streak's still there." So, there's certain elements of the feature that we can do better at explaining, but even what a streak is, it's tracking how many days that I've used the app, yeah, the more that we can make the feature easily comprehensible to users, the more retentive it is. And we've run a number of experiments to do this.

(00:34:23):
You asked about early easy copy changes that we made. Actually, this is my first win experiment when I joined Duolingo was, when you start a streak, we have little copy at the bottom of the screen that just, I don't know, it's like flavor copy, we use it to celebrate you, or give you context, and I ran some tests that just tried to in eight words explained what a streak was, that was it. And it was a massive win because it really dumbed down here is exactly how the streak worked, and it really helped users just understand what they needed to do. And I think this is something that's like, you constantly got to remind yourself, particularly if you work in tech and you're building cool tech features, but your user base is not a bunch of tech workers, to think about, all right, who is my audience? And for us it's not just tech workers, it's not people in America, it's people all over the world of all ages of all cultures, and so making sure that your feature is even something as simple as the streak is understandable is critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):
What was the actual copy, do you remember?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:29):
It was... I think it's still on the app, it's like, "Start a day to extend your streak, but miss a day and it resets," something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:38):
That makes sense to me. Very clear.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):
In eight words, I love that. Okay. And then, when you say massive win by the way, just to give people a reference point, what does that look like? What is a massive win in this scale?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:50):
Well, and it's funny, and this was four years ago, but I think it was in the order of magnitude of over 10,000 DAUs for us, and actually, maybe a small bit of context. So, Duolingo really cares about the metric CURR current user retention rate, and actually our first ever Duolingo post with Lenny was the newsletter that our former head of product wrote, Jorge.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):
Still the single most popular newsletter post of all time in my newsletter, across 300 plus-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:36:15):
I would highly recommend that if you were interested in this, give it a read. To summarize, basically, what we found is that, if we wanted to drive DAUs, and Duolingo cares, our growth North Star is DAUs, the metric that is most effective, where a percentage change in that metric is most effective at driving DAUs is current user retention rate. And this is just users who are not new or resurrected, getting them to come back tomorrow. And so, most of the work that our teams do, our retention-based teams do is focused on CURR. And so, the retention team that I lead focused on CURR, it just so happens the streak is the best feature at driving CURR. And so, this experiment was the biggest CURR win that we had had, and it was like a top three CURR win, anyway for us. Just this little copy. And that's why I say, test copy 1000 different ways, sometimes it's not the big beautiful feature that's going to drive the huge gains, sometimes it's just something simple as a few words.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):
I love this. Okay, so you said 10,000 DAUs, I think that references you guys measure incremental impact and absolute numbers of new daily users you're going to drive attributed to that experiment, is what it sounds like.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:37:28):
Yeah, and we do both. We'll also look at, a lot of times I'll look at, for retention, day one versus day seven versus day 14, a lot of what I'm looking for is for us to have a better day 14 impact than better day one impact because it means that users are retaining better over time. This is particularly for users that would see a feature multiple times. I just like absolute DAU numbers because as long as you're controlling for different biases, like a recency bias or a novelty bias, it's a really easy way to just have an absolute comparison. You start to look at percentage changes and then it's influenced by who your treatment, how many users saw the experiment, but at least an absolute number is easier, in my mind, to start comparing.. Again, there are pitfalls with it, but we find that that's a pretty useful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):
That lesson comes up a lot on this podcast, and that approach to experiment.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:38:25):
[inaudible 00:38:25].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
So, yeah, you're in good company. Quick tangent, if there's not an answer to this, no problem, coming back to the idea of just experimenting like crazy and not creating a product that nobody wants to use anymore, is there an example of an experiment that was positive that you all decided, no, we don't actually think this is what we want in the product, they ended up not shipping?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:38:47):
Retention doesn't only work on the streak, although you would think... Most of our work is the streak. We've touched a lot of different surfaces over the years and there was one experiment that we launched that, we talked about XP earlier, in the lesson, the only UI elements are a progress bar at the top, and then how many hearts you have. So, we keep it really simple, and this very much speaks to the design philosophy of Duolingo, which is simpler UI is better, and we decided, hey, let's add XP in there. And so let's show your XP ticking up as you're going through a lesson, that's going to make the user feel good, it's going to show you what you've earned, you're going to be less likely to quit, all of these good reasons to do it. And then you finish the lesson and then we'll show you've collected all this XP.

(00:39:29):
And it won, the hypothesis was a good one. But we realized, and I remember having this conversation with Luis, is like, cool, this is our most important screen in the app, it is our lesson, it is where users learn, and the focus here is on learning. And now you've added this other thing up there that could be distracting for users. And I think the question, we talked about roadmaps and strategy here, the question that he had for me, and I didn't have a good answer for at the time, was like, so what else are you going to do with this? What's your iteration ideas? Where's this going to go? Is this going to make the lesson experience more gamified? And what we realized is that, honestly, it was just an easy engagement win idea, but we had touched our most sacred space in the app to do that.

(00:40:16):
And so, that was a case where it's like, yeah, it was a nice win, but we'd added that UI element, and at least at the time it was less clear what we would do with it and we realized that long term it was just going to get in the way, and we'd rather, for simplicity's sake, pause that, shut it down, and keep the lesson to be a little bit of learning sanctuary it was. Now, it's funny, nowadays I think we actually have enough XP based mechanics and fun things that we can do, that I think actually a lot of the beliefs about the in-lesson experience have changed, such as something like that could work, but at the time didn't feel good to keep that around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):
That is an awesome example. Hopefully we have time to talk about how the team operates, where my mind goes is like, oh, but you have all these PMs and teams that want to show impact, and the performance reviews, and all that stuff, and you're not shipping something, they're like, oh look, we did a win. So, I want to chat about that later, but let's keep going on things you've learned and things that didn't work along the journey.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:41:15):
The other thing that I'll call out with the streak, it's like we have the... The image of the streak is this flame. And we have the streak flame, and it's very much core to our iconography. It's important to acknowledge that that's a metaphor for a retention mechanic. The idea of keeping a flame lit. And again, I think we've established the flame is for a lot of users as sort of their understanding of a streak, which is great, but there's a lot of people in different cultural context and different stages of life, where the idea of keeping a flame lit to show your commitment to something makes less sense. We did some UXR in India many years ago, and this was something that just did not resonate at all there, which was a really interesting learning. And that's something it's like, again, depending upon what your user base is, the more global UXR you can do to understand how users are actually understanding and experience your feature, the better, because you just, again, encounter insights like this.

(00:42:12):
And so, even our screen design, we used to have a flame, it was mostly this flame that would light up every day. But again, it was like an indication of a metaphor for a mechanic, and when we redesigned it, we did this, Kurt, one of our animators, did this awesome odometer animation where it's like your number would tick every day... It looked good, but from a product perspective, what was cool is we actually focused the design on the screen to show your number going up, and then it would say seven day streak, eight day streak. And I think that as you're thinking about designing around a streak, don't get too caught up into what is this the beautiful story that you're trying to tell, at the expense of it being a really comprehensible feature. And so, as you're thinking about product design, making that product design a clear distillation of this is what we're actually tracking, form should follow a function here, was a learning for us. And you'll see that now in a lot of places where we're showing streak, we're really leading with the number, not necessarily the flame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
That's a theme that I'm hearing again and again is clarity, don't obsess with making it too clever, and don't ever think it, just clarity has a big impact.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:43:29):
Clarity also doesn't have to come at the expense of delight. And this is something where you hit a milestone and Duo gets, it becomes, we call him a Phoenix Duo, and he becomes awesome, and lights on fire, and I think there are things that you can do to still make the experience really exciting and delightful and celebratory, and I would not lose that, but just don't do it at the expense... And I think it's also about figuring out, you can get away with doing more of this for users who are deeper into their streak experience than users who are starting, where it's like your goal for the one-day streak user is just to make sure, do they understand how this feature works?

(00:44:06):
Even something... Again, just another random experiment. At the bottom of the streak screen we have a calendar, and over the years it just looks more and more calendar-like, and that is simply because we find that the more we make it look like a calendar, days on top, little circles, the check... The more we make it look like calendar, the more that people realize, hey, this is a daily mechanic. And so, think about the screen holistically, but every single thing that you're doing on the screen, how can you use it to communicate what is the point of this feature? How does it work?

(00:45:43):
I imagine one of the biggest wins was just giving people flexibility along the journey, like streak freezes and all these things, is that a big vein of opportunity discovery?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:45:52):
It is. Actually, I'm going to show you one of the most thoughtful gifts that anybody has ever given to me, this is our Duolingo Serenity, or Streak Serenity Prayer, my co-lead, Antonia-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):
It's like knitted, right?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:05):
... [inaudible 00:46:05] this for me. It's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):
Wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:06):
And so it says, "Luis, grant me the serenity to accept the flexibility I need, the courage to reach perfection when I can, and the wisdom to celebrate regardless."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):
Aw.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:15):
And that actually is kind of our strategy with the streaks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):
I love the show and tell by the way, that was great.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:20):
Yeah. Well, I guess for podcast listeners, we'll have to get an image somewhere. This idea of flexibility versus perfection, and then regardless, celebration, is core to how we think about the streak. Because I think for the streak for us, it's very much a bend not break. If you're going to miss a day, I'd rather you come back, having missed that day, to an intact streak, but if you don't have to miss a day, I'd much rather you don't, I'd much rather you come back and use the app every day. So, that thing on flexibility though, that's almost certainly been the biggest, from a mechanic perspective, the biggest DAU driver. One of the earliest experiments we ran was going from you used to only be able to have one streak freeze and then we let you have either two or three. So, we tested two different arms. It was, again, another huge DAU win.

(00:47:12):
This actually is funny, it was something that... And this is, again, a callback to that growth model post from Jorge. It actually was really bad for CURR because we were basically saying, hey, you can take a day off, and that's okay, but it was really good for, this is going to be like Alphabet Soup, [inaudible 00:47:31], a weekly active user return rate. So, basically, users who had taken a day off, we were getting them to come back more at higher rates, and so it made up for our losses in CURR. But effectively, what this meant is that, why two streak freezes work better than one was, I don't know, sometimes people just need a little bit more flexibility than one day. But again, the really interesting insight of this experiment was that three streak freezes was actually no better than two streak freezes. And there were two competing things here, and I think this is important if you're going to build a streak to figure out what your flexibility mechanic is.

(00:48:03):
We were getting more users to return after longer times away to an intact streak. But if you start taking three days off from any habit, it's just going to be less likely that you return even four days later. And so, we had these competing things where more users might be returning to a streak, but a lot of users were also just not coming back, we were training them to take more time off. So, that flexibility, what's the right amount of... We've again, this is another area we've run hundreds of experiments on, what is the right amount of flexibility? And we are constantly surprised here. I still don't have the answer for at every point in your streak journey how much flexibility you need. One thing that I can say with certainty though is, give more flexibility when a user is starting their streak. Again, one of our biggest streak freeze experiment wins... I feel like I'm constantly saying this, one of our biggest wins, but they all were really, really big.

(00:48:59):
One of our biggest streak freeze wins was when you start a new streak, we give you two streak freezes. And again, it's so funny to think back, it's like how are we not doing this to begin with? But at the time, the streak freeze was an overly gamified mechanic, you had to buy them with gems, that's our in-app currency, because we wanted the whole idea of this to feel like it was really something you earned, that there was a little bit of pain to getting that streak freeze. And so, we tested though, what if we just give users when they start off their streak two streak freezes, and holy smokes to that win.

(00:49:33):
And it's sort of obvious now, in retrospect, but if you have a one or a two or a three-day streak, it's really easy just to let it die and restart, again, you need to get to seven days, what we've seen in the data, for it to really lock in. And so, giving users more flexibility so that it's harder to lose their streak initially, and then conversely, and this is what we keep learning, eventually, once people get on long streaks, you don't want to give them as much flexibility. Because there's a lot of times where, yeah, users don't... And I'm like this, I've got a 400-day streak. Note that that is a lot less time than I've been at Duolingo, I have lost and restarted streaks a lot of times at my time at Duolingo.

(00:50:14):
But you start getting on long streaks, and you really care about this feature, you really care about your streak. And most people, as long as you're not backpacking through, I don't know, the back country of Utah, you'll be in a place where you can get service. And so, figuring out who is the user that actually could use Duolingo, and not conditioning them to start taking days off that they didn't otherwise need to do is important to figure out where that line is for your feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:46):
This is fascinating. You can also buy a streak, right? With money. That's a feature, right?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:50:51):
Yeah. And it's funny, this is also something that we [inaudible 00:50:54]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:53):
You can buy a freeze, sorry, not a streak.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:50:56):
Yeah. So, you can buy a streak freeze, and the way it works is you can buy gems, and then you can use those gems to buy a streak... And this is something we wrestle with. We're actively working on an experiment, right now that's having a small hit to revenue, but it's a really nice win for retention, and I think it's actually worth thinking about from day one, as you're building a streak, do you see this more as a monetization feature, or do you see this more as a retention feature? What's the role of monetization in this? What's the role of retention? And I think for us it started out much more organically, and so we have a lot of monetization hooks, that again, is the retention PM, I would love to get rid of. But again, it's sort of part of how the streak works right now. And so, we always have this tension of, hey, if we start to make it harder to buy streak freezes, then fewer people buy them, buy gems to buy them, and so there's this more convoluted series of impacts that happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:49):
Yeah, no, I love that people wanting to buy streak freeze is like the ultimate sign of how much streaks matter.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:51:57):
Yeah, streak freeze is the other big one that we've recently demonetized, or introduced a free option for, is getting back a lost streak. So, used to lose a streak, we had a feature, in the day, back in the day, called Streak Repair, we'd give you your streak back, you had to pay gems. But what we found that worked way better was a feature called Earn Back, and this is basically where you would have to do a certain number of lessons, as long as you came back within a window soon after losing your streak, do a few lessons and we just give you your streak back. And that was such a retention winner. And again, what we thought about was it feels like you've earned it so much more when you've done... You deserve to have your streak back, we haven't cheapen the streak because you've done something.

(00:52:44):
And in this sense, this idea of cheapening the streak is something, like from a philosophical... Philosophy of the streak. From a philosophical level, we wrestle with all the time, of, cool, we're giving out more streak freezes, at what point do we cross the line and users start to realize their streak means nothing? Now, everything that we've seen, users are totally cool with using streak freezes and still thinking about their streak is this meaningful thing, but my co-lead, Antonia, who made that awesome cross-stitch for me, she is the keeper for us of the sanctity of the streak. And a lot of times as we... And I think this is really important to have, as you're thinking about building your streak. You can almost always get engagement wins, up to a certain point, by just cheapening the streak, making it easier to extend, letting users have more flexibility, but you kind of got to hold the line at some point.

(00:53:30):
And it's not clear where that line is. And once you... You talk about one-way doors or two-way doors, there's a point where you go too far and it's a one-way door, and all of a sudden those users, those 9 million users on one-year streaks don't care about their streak anymore. And that is, I don't know, again, retention PM perspective, that'd be an extinction level event for us. I don't want all of these users to stop caring about their streak. And so, to have somebody who is invested in the sanctity of this streak, and for us it's Antonia and Luis, he's very good about this, is really important, just so you make sure you don't go too far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):
That's an awesome insight. So, to protect... And push notifications I think are another example of this in general for companies, how much is too much? Because everyone is just like, let's just send another push, it's fine, just one more. And so, your solution to that is a person is like the keeper, and almost the gatekeeper, plus the founder, of how far is too far.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:26):
It's good if you can have that. I think push notifications are also easier because there's a lot of things you can do around, all right, we'll send a budget cap for how many notifications we'll send, you can-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):
It's like [inaudible 00:54:38] policy.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:38):
Yeah, policies. But I think with a lot of things, at least for the streak, it's harder to create policies for in the same way, a lot of it has to be done based on feel, and so you just got to use your best judgment at times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):
Sweet. Okay. Any other, maybe one or two more lessons from this journey of what streaks has become today.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:56):
You mentioned notifications, and I've mentioned this a few times. One... It's funny, you tend to think of, exactly as you say, you can just always send another notification, it's going to be some win, and at some point it'll be a bad experience, but it's tough to see that. There's actually a notification that we... So, we send two notifications related to your core streak each day, the first is a practice reminder, we send it, this is actually an interesting insight, 23 and a half hours after you practice the day before. Whoa, that is a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:21):
23 and a half. Okay,

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:55:23):
So, basically, if you practice at noon today, we'll send it to you at 11:30 AM tomorrow, and we have done-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
And it's, because it's like assuming they are free in that time the day before, maybe they'll be free at the same time?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:55:36):
And we actually moved, we used to let users set this practice reminder time, and our thinking was, cool, you're going to say 7:00 PM, that's when I really want to extend my streak each day, and then you know what? I say this to somebody with two kids, life gets in the way, life always gets in the way, and when you think you're going to practice will change, your life will change, whatever. And what we realize is the best indicator of when you should practice was when did you practice the day before. We could almost certainly get more detailed, we have tried a bunch of ways to have much more complex logic, and what always wins is 23 and a half hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):
That's so interesting. Revealed behavior versus stated.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:56:10):
Yeah, exactly. So, again, we send this practice reminder 23 and a half hours later, the other thing that we'll do though is we'll send a, what we call a streak saver, and this is at 10:00 at night, if you have not extended your streak, we'll send you a message saying, hey, it's your last chance, this is it, if you don't extend your streak. And you would think that, that's kind of spammy, that's kind of annoying, to get a notification from an app at 10:00 PM, but what we found is because people care about their streak, their streak is this good thing that they attach positive emotions, that they don't really want to lose, that notification reminding them, hey, come back and... People see this by and large as a positive notification and not a negative notification.

(00:56:53):
Obviously, it serves our purpose as well of getting users to come back and not lose their streaks, but again, I think if you can think about your notification strategy related to what is the feature that it's tied to, how do users perceive that? You can almost certainly, not get away with more, but you can be thoughtful about notification load, and when to send notifications, and again, for us, this late night message, that's also highly impactful, super good, is actually something that could be perceived as spammy, but a lot of our users really do... Somebody who, it's often late at night, and I work here, and I'm like, oh, forgot to do my... I was think about Duolingo all day, here it is, 11:15, and I still haven't done it, that message is really powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:36):
Yeah. It has saved me many times, I totally know that message, and I love that it's a late night message from an app, very rarely do you actually, are happy about that, and I love that this actually is a good example where-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:57:51):
It's really funny, all of the stories that you hear about people extending their streak, if you look around a Duolingo party, where it's like 11:30, 11:45, all the Duolingo employees, they're are doing their lesson at the last minute. You always see these pictures of people in the club doing, or at a concert doing Duolingo, and yeah, because it's like otherwise you're going to use a streak freezer, or God forbid you will lose your streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):
That's so funny. Okay, anything else? And if there's more than one more, definitely share, but any other really interesting lessons or wrong turns or insights?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:58:23):
I talked about streak freezes, and we've done a lot with streak freeze, but I think if you're going to make flexibility a thing, it's probably also useful thinking about how do you celebrate perfection. And so, we have a feature that we have, it is the simplest thing in the world, it's called Perfect Streak. And it's just, if you don't use the streak freeze for a few days, we make your streak look gold, and we make your little progress bar on the calendar just look a little bit nicer. There's no reward for doing it, you don't get anything other than this nice little indication, and it is awesome. It is a simple feature, it is ultra not complex, and it is really powerful, not only for getting users to, as a bit of a reward, they'd be hey, get to seven days without using a streak freeze and your streak becomes perfect, but it's also a really nice indication of users who aren't using streak freezes.

(00:59:14):
Here is the thing that if you don't use a streak freeze, which, again candidly, I would love for you never to use a streak freeze, if you don't use a streak freeze, your streak will stay perfect. It's funny, we actually just, we're constantly responding to bug reports about the streak. It is... I swear to God, we have the best infrastructure around this feature because it is so important. We had an employee who lost her, I think a four-month perfect streak, and it was a big deal for her because she did her lesson, and she was crossing international dateline, there was a bunch of stuff going on that was like, it was just kind of weird in our backend. But people start to care about perfection as much as they do their streak, and for that person it was a big deal when they lost their perfect streak. And so, this is just an example of, look, if you're going to go after flexibility, which is good, finding a way to pull users back into perfection is a really important counterweight to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:13):
What I'm imagining is you guys need a Amazon style chatbot that just gives you the streak back, it's just like, okay, here you go.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:00:20):
We have very much... So, we have, if people lose their streak, there's ways to get in contact with us, but we've actually thought about that, where it's like, okay, we should just build a self-service feature, and if we think that your excuse is good enough, whatever, we'll just [inaudible 01:00:34].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
Yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:00:35].

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:00:36):
Because again, I'd much rather you be on a streak than have lost it, particularly [inaudible 01:00:41].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
Right. But it also can feel that easy. I love this, I also love this point about just the power of the animation and user experience having impact, that's really interesting. Is that something you find often, just celebrating and making it feel really amazing without copy or any feature is just like, holy, you're awesome?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:01:02):
This is another thing where it's like when users care about the feature, using not only animation, haptics, sound effects, using... And it's funny, we don't have sound effects on the streak, this is probably something we'll look at in the not too distant in future, but haptics are something we have done a lot of testing on-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):
Like the phone vibrating in various ways.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:01:20):
Yeah, exactly, your phone, there being a really cool haptic pattern as you extend your streak, all of this stuff wins. And it's cool because I think it wins... There's a few reasons. One is it just makes you feel good, you get some cool moment in your streak, and we celebrate you, and we celebrate you in this visual way, and your phone's buzzing, it just feels awesome. The other thing it does is it causes you to pause on that screen, and I think there's this desire, as you think through a lot of, as PMs think through, oh, how can I get users through this funnel as painlessly as possible? I talked about [inaudible 01:01:52]. There's a lot of times where I don't, I want you to stop. I want you to stop and land on the screen.

(01:01:56):
You got to be careful not to do this for too many screens, but the one big ones, sometimes I just want you to pause there and enjoy the moment. If I can get you to enjoy the moment more, you're going to care more about your streak, and you're going to be coming back tomorrow. And so, animations that are cool, and that cause you to really soak it in, haptics that feel good, all of that comes together to make you really focus on that moment, all of that just gets users more connected to their streak. So, animation in the right times works well and it's something we've had win quite a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
Who designs the haptic stuff? Is there a haptic designer?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:02:33):
For the longest time it would be a product designer, or actually, it initially started as the engineer would be like, all right, would cobble together haptics, based on what they felt good, then it became a product design role, where they would use their best judgment. We actually just recently required an animation studio, Hobbs in Detroit, and now they are the sort of keepers of, they do a lot of motion design work, haptics very close to that, and so they do a lot of that. I do remember trying to hire for a while a haptics contractor, like haptics design, and it was the saddest hiring I've ever done, because it was just, I don't know, it was such a specific... I don't know. I just went through a lot of people who, it's just a really tricky space of kind of sound effects, kind of motion design, sort of technical...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:22):
Yeah, such a unique role.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:25):
Very unique specific skill set.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):
Right. And there's very few apps that really need this this deeply, so you're almost creating this person.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):
That is fascinating. That's like a whole podcast on its own. By the way, I was going to say as you're talking about this, I love that it's a win to celebrate people that don't lose their streak, you introduce this way to make it flexible, and that's a big win, and then you go the opposite direction of, if you don't use this feature, you also feel even better.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:51):
Well, and it's funny, you talked about the danger of feature bloat, or we sort of talked about the danger of feature bloat, this is actually something I'm constantly thinking about with this. We have the streak, but then we also have the perfect streak, and we count how many weeks you've had a perfect streak. Well, all of a sudden we have two streak numbers that are competing with each other. It's funny, we actually don't introduce the concept of a perfect streak until after you've hit seven days, and some of this is just because the cognitive load of additional streak features. A lot of our cooler streak features, you got to get on a long enough streak. And not to say we haven't tested it because we have, because we test everything, introducing these features earlier, but what we've found is that pretty universally they lose when we introduce too many things, too many concepts to users too early in the experience, it's just hard for them to manage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:39):
Okay, sweet. I know that we can go down this track for hours and hours, there's endless learnings about all the things you all have done along the journey. I want to shift to talking about how your team operates. So, there's a lot of threads you touched on of just how a team can do this so well, shift 600 experiments, as you said, continue to find opportunity. What are some maybe lessons or advice you'd have for folks that are like, oh wow, I want to work more like this, from your team's experience, how does your team to operate that folks can learn from?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:05:13):
Yeah, maybe just a little bit of context. Duolingo cares a lot about... So, most of our teams are metric-based teams. So, we do the most work with streak, but the metric, what we really care about at the end of the day is CURR, and DAUs, because we see that DAUs hit CURR. And so, when you can be really laser focused on, my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up, I think it's much easier to make sure that you're working on the highest ROI thing. I think when you think more about like, oh, I want to make this feature better, I think it's easier to get lost in what better means, and how you think about better. And so, I do think that having a really strong degree of focus as a team on what is the metric that I'm caring about, and how is that directing my efforts is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:59):
Versus feature-oriented. So, basically your teams are structured around a metric/a goal/outcome versus we own this feature, or this product.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:06:07):
So, retention owns streak, I guess, but that's only because we've seen streak drive CURR better than any feature. But we are not, we have this IAP hook with our streak freeze purchases, there are other teams that work on, that can and have worked on the streak, because it's not ours to say, no, no, no, we do all the iterations here, we just know that it drives our metric better. In the same way that leaderboards, we have a team that focuses on how much time you spent, we want users to spend more time on Duolingo so they're learning more. Leaderboards is the best vector for doing it, so that team does a lot of leaderboards work, but every now and then I have an idea that I think will be highly retentive, and I will go in, and I'll pitch to them, and then we'll do some change to the leaderboard to make it more retentive.

(01:06:53):
But I do think having that clear metric of we're trying to drive CURR not we're trying to just make this feature better, helps at least make sure, give the team clear marching orders, and that focus I think is really good for prioritizing backlog.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:07):
Cool. This is a really important point, this is the same way Airbnb worked, when I worked there for a long time, is it's, here's a goal that we want your team to be responsible for, you can work on any product you need to hit this goal, as you said, often various products are most connected to what you're doing, but what you're describing is, even though a team's kind of... I imagine you own it from a [inaudible 01:07:29] perspective, and you're like are the shepherd of this part of the feature because it hits your goal, helps your goal most. But any other team can come in and be like, hey Jackson, we need to work on some streak stuff to help with learning, you're like, go for it. Just a tangent there. Do they work really closely with your team if they want to do some work in the code? How does that work logistically?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:07:49):
Yeah. If you are, again, this is where I say there's soft ownership, we're not against teams doing things to the streak, but if we're going to do something given we probably have multiple quarters worth of a roadmap around the streak... I say probably, we do. Multiple quarters of roadmap for what we can do to the streak, if other teams want to come and mess with it, okay, we got to just figure out how is that going to work with what our plans for the streak were, how do we make sure a lot of times when teams are coming in thinking, hey, let's do this to the streak, they're in context that we might have, and so there's as much of a much simpler version of what we're doing now, a bit of a knowledge sharing, of saying, all right, well, this is what we think about the streak, this is what we've seen work, hasn't worked, how does that influence some of the hypothesis that you have. And so, I think getting that really... Making sure the juice is worth the squeeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):
Good old-fashioned product management work right there.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:08:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):
Cool. What else is interesting about how you all operate and how you all work to achieve this sort of success?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:08:41):
Again, my team lead runs, Antonia runs the most... A really process, if you're going to run this experiments, you have to be really process-oriented and really thoughtful about which experiments am I going to run when, how is that going to set up the next one, there's heavy Jira automation, I think sometimes the Atlassian suite makes my eyes bleed, but there's a lot of times where that degree of process helps the team unblock engineers and make them move really fast. And so, making sure that you have really good process around how are you going to run so many experiments, it's worth investing in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
Can you follow that thread actually? Just when you say that, what does that look like? What are some elements of that process to make this work efficiently?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:09:25):
All the way down to, really detailed roadmaps around, all right, we're running this experiment is based on the results of this experiment, or might hook into an element of this feature, how do we make sure that we're lining up implementation on this so that as soon as this thing runs and we're ready to go, we can start rolling out the next one. I hate features just sitting around and us not, again, continuing that thread. So, it's not just thinking about what's our engineering bandwidth, but also what's the design bandwidth to make sure that we have the next iteration of this feature ready to go. We're planning months out, as we think about these feature iterations, even small ones, feature iterations, because when you lose cycles, not pushing on a feature, it's just sort of lost opportunity. And so, everything from being thoughtful about engineering roadmaps to design roadmaps to product roadmaps, all of that needs to come together in a system.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):
So, essentially, mapping dependencies across function, and you're saying in Jira you can do this.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:25):
You can do a lot of it in Jira, there is a non-zero amount of Google Docs that we have, that sometimes does things a little bit... I don't know, sometimes it just looks a little bit nicer, it's a little more flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Yeah. [inaudible 01:10:38].

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:37):
But Jira is our, it is where the motherload of process is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):
Great. Okay. What else?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:44):
Another thing that I'll just say is, we really resist the urge to do the big V1. And I think this is, I shared the streak goal example, where, a lot of times when we're exploring something we will say, okay, well, that's cool, how do we strip away a bunch of stuff and figure out what our core hypothesis is? And then, just ship that thing first as a V1. Because it's easy, and I've found this time and time again, it's easy to add things, features that make them win, I've worked in retention engagement long enough, I can add, I know enough things to pull, and bells to add, and whistles to make something win, but there's a lot of times where it's like cool, t [inaudible 01:11:27] because all the whistles you added, not because of what your core hypothesis was, and a lot of times if you can just really simplify what the feature is, it's also much easier to ship, it's easier to design.

(01:11:37):
You're not designing for a whole system, you're designing for something much simpler. And so, getting everybody to think that way, allows us to end up shipping faster, shipping simpler, designing faster, getting faster approval, getting insight, and then doing what I talked about with streak goal, being able to run iteration after iteration after iteration, add these things iteratively. And then not only by doing this are you able to move faster, but you get confidence at each step of the way, that, hey, my series of hypotheses is actually born out. Or if it's not, cool, then we're going to drop that part of the feature, and then just ship what actually matters.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):
If I can try to summarize the broad lesson so far that I'm hearing, and maybe you would've shared this, but I'm just thinking, if I were to try to design a company to operate, that we all operate, you essentially map all the levers that drive the business. So, you have this mapping of all the metrics that drive up to growth and daily active users. CURR ended up being the biggest specific metric to drive growth long term, so there's imagining a tree of all the opportunities you could work on, you found this is what is most connected to our growth. You basically just start mining, I don't know if mining is the right metaphor, but just looking for things that move that specific metric.

(01:13:04):
You just look and poke and explore, and then once you find one, you just go real deep on trying a lot of different... You come up with a hypothesis, and a strategy of here's how we think we can do this, and how we can move this, and then you just try a bunch of stuff. There's also this element of the Arrested Development quote, "There's always money in the banana stand," comes to mind, where it's just keep working on, see there's more, there's going to be more opportunity at this.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:13:29):
When I joined Duolingo, the PM that I took over for, Anton, who used to lead the retention team, I remember saying, "Dude, the streak, it just counts up, you guys have been testing on it for years, how much more work can we do on the streak?" And he was like, Jackson, you child... He didn't say exactly this, but this is how I felt it. Like, Jackson, you child, we're not even 30% of the way optimized. And four years later, I say that with such conviction, we are so far away from... We've made a ton of strides, but we are still so far away, and every quarter where we ship a ton of wins and improvements to the streak, it just continues to prove to me that there is so much more to be done.

(01:14:11):
So, I think your framing of it is... And I would say there's a lot of thought that goes into, again, I talk about the strength of the hypothesis that you have to have as you start to build out larger feature strategy, I do think it's really important to not just do a bunch of random stuff but do it with intent, with a goal in mind, otherwise, you do end up in these local maximas. But yeah, there's still a bunch of stuff that we haven't tried that I think we have high confidence in working out and so we'll keep doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:45):
Are there any other, say, lasting lessons from this journey that if someone were to try to operate this way, build streaks into their product, anything you'd recommend?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:14:55):
Yeah, I really do think it starts with... Streaks are an engagement hack. You can make your app more retentive, I'm almost positive, almost every app out there can make it more retentive. It is loss aversion, that is, again, armchair psychologist Jackson, it's just a thing that works on humans. But if your app is not something that users want to use every day, or whatever cadence you want your app to be, to work on, it's going to be, you're only going to get so much from that streak, and honestly, it's probably going to distract you from what really should matter, which is making your app something that people want to use every day.

(01:15:35):
And so, if you start focusing on the streak but you haven't made that an enjoyable experience, you're just going to waste a lot of time, honestly. And so, I think making sure that you have your core loop of your app figured out, that it is giving value to users, it is something that they want to come back to every day, that really sets the stage for something to layer a streak on. So, resist the temptation, if you don't think you've reached that point, to go too hard down the path of streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):
That's a really good point. Just like a streak is not going to solve your problems if people don't actually care about the core value you're providing.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:16:09):
No, and honestly, it'll probably cause more problems if what you end up focusing on is how do I make the streak highly engaging, but your app is... You're wasting time that could otherwise be better spent on solving more critical problems. So, that's one learning, the other thing that I'll say is, we met with one of our board members, Bing, Bing Gordon, a few weeks, or a few months ago rather, and he had this comment where he was just like, "The reason why users care about your streak so much is because you care about your streaks much." You being Duolingo. The reason why users care about our streak so much is because Duolingo cares about the streaks so much. And we're like, what do you mean? Well, he's like, well, after every session you see a big streak screen, and it's animated cooler than almost any other screen in the app, and then sometimes you see some other screens, and there's all these other... You don't let a user forget it, you talk about them in messages.

(01:17:01):
And so, I think it's worth thinking about, look, if you're going to build a streak, and then you're going to [inaudible 01:17:06] it off into the corner of your app, where users aren't going to see it, they're probably not going to care about it as much, which might be fine, because there might be other levers that you think are more important to pull on, but there's a reason why we focus as much on the streak as we do, and that's because we want it to be top of mind for users. And that's not by accident then that users start to care about it. And so, I think just as you're thinking about building the streak, making sure that you're giving it the visibility it deserves, if you want it to have the kind of impact that Duolingo has, it's sort of an important hierarchy principle to think about as you design things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
That's such a good point. You look for cues to the app of tell me what I should pay attention to, what's important? If you're just like fire, explosions, you made a streak, oh, maybe I should pay attention to this feature. And then the push notifications obviously encourage you there too. Anything else along those lines?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:17:58):
Maybe final thing is, look, we ran so many tests on our Duolingo streak to figure out what worked. We have a philosophy at Duolingo, of test it first. We are a lot of times willing to test things. I really think that if you're going to try to introduce a streak, or you want to improve on the streak you have, don't get too caught up in the philosophy of everything, make sure your hypotheses feel like they're good, but my recommendation is just try things. And this is, again, you said it earlier, it's like this is as much human psychology as anything, and as soon as that becomes the case, you kind of just got to understand what users respond to. And the easiest way to do that is to stop spending time batting around ideas in a conference room and just try some stuff. So, huge recommendation to if you're going to invest in a streak, try and figure out what works through testing with users rather than trying to get it perfect on the first try.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):
Say someone's listening and they're like, should we do streak, is this worth doing? What's your take on just the chances that a streak feature would be helpful to another consumer?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:19:07):
I am well known for saying in the company that I think every team, every app could benefit from a streak. Now, how you implement it is very different, and I think you got to, what is your user's use case? If they're going to come use, I don't know, tax software... Okay, you know what? Now that I say this, tax software would be a hard one, but maybe it's all about you need users to come back every day, during the tax season, or how many times... I don't know. Now, that I say this out loud-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:35):
Times you upload your [inaudible 01:19:37] forms.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:19:37):
Yeah, that is a hard use case. But the vast majority of companies I think have a good idea of like, all right, here is my ideal use case, I want users to come here three times a month, that would be ideal. Or four times a month. You can build a streak to work. Peloton has weekly streaks because the idea of doing a Peloton workout every single day was hard for this user during COVID. It was just like every now and then you get on the Peloton, that was great, but the idea of a weekly streak was something that I could keep up. And so, I think figure out what your usage pattern is, as a user, and then build your streak around it. But as long as you're not a really, again, the tax example is probably a good counterfactual, but as long as you have some degree of frequency in your use, I think almost anything can have a streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:29):
So, Duolingo, it's, again, a $14 billion company, this feature, possibly the most contributing factor, other than the core product, to that level of success in market cap, and it's hard to imagine another just feature of a product that has had this much impact on growth and revenue and building this sort of business. So, I love that we spent this much time on it, the motherload, the motherload of advice and insights. So, thank you again for putting-

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:20:59):
Of course. Very fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:00):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:05):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:06):
First question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:10):
All right, I'll start with A Guide to Midwest Conversation. So, I'm based in Kansas City, I'm a proud Midwesterner, and us Midwesterners talk in a certain way. I think you hear about Minnesota nice, but we tend not to say what we mean, and it is a very funny primer into what Midwesterners actually mean when they say what they say. So, highly recommend reading that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
I like that you give that to people, just like, here's what I might be telling you, which you may not read.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:38):
My wife is German, and I gave it to her so she could better understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):
I see German being the opposite of that, okay.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:44):
Very different. Another book, this is a good one, Fate is the Hunter. This is a really cool book, it's a memoir of one of the early commercial airline pilots, and it is wild to hear the stories about what flying was back in the day. I'm a former management consultant, I flew every week for almost six years, and I never once had to worry about, am I going to make it to the other end of this flight alive? That was not the case back then, and so some of the stories about what it used to be like to be a pilot on some of these planes, before modern aviation technology, is fascinating, and makes you really appreciate what we have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
It feels good to read a book like that, being a software PM or engineer or whatever, how different that life is.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:22:28):
Hardware is hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:28):
Hardware. Oh man, it's not haptic design. Okay. Next, unless there's any other books you're going to share? No, okay, great. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:22:40):
So, I have two kids, I watch a lot of Bluey, it's really good, I swear, it brings me no shortage of joy. But adult show or show not meant for four-year-olds that I have watched, I just finished the latest season of Emily in Paris, man, wonderful. I realize it's not the highest brow of television, but just beautiful people in beautiful cities, solving problems that are not earth-shattering, sometimes it is nice to just tune out. Also, I'm learning French on Duolingo, slight plug for the app, I can understand a lot of the French that is being spoken, and there is no better joy than having invested as much time as I have in French, and actually being able to use it. So, huge fan of Emily.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):
That is so funny, what a fun Venn diagram of interests. My mother-in loves Emily in Paris, I saw someone tweeting about what Visa is she on? How is she still in Paris?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:23:33):
Yeah. You best just not ask questions, there's a lot of questions for this show that are better left unasked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:40):
[inaudible 01:23:40] Okay. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like? Other than Duolingo.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:23:44):
Last week I went to Home Depot, and I bought a new ladder, and ladder innovations, you don't think of often, but you can make one of the legs go a little bit further than the other leg. And as somebody like myself who has a house that is built on a slight slope, every time I go up on my ladder, I take my life in my hands, but with this ladder, I'm always even. I cleaned my gutters twice last week just because of how awesome this ladder has... How much this ladder has changed my life. So, ladder innovation, I don't think it gets talked enough about and so I'm happy to give it the spotlight it deserves.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:18):
I appreciate you doing that, and it's the first ladder recommendation we've had on the podcast. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you really find useful in work or in life they share with folks?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:24:26):
This probably will not be much of a surprise based on how I've talked about our willingness to test things, but you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm a big fan of just trying things, even if your possibility of success is not 100, because you learn a lot along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:44):
Final question, do you have any fun traditions at Duolingo, amongst either the PM team or the company in general that might be delightful to share?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:24:53):
We have way too many traditions to count. I will share the weird tradition that we do at every retention standup, and this started during the pandemic, we obviously used to stand up in person, and then when we went remote, we did this thing where whoever's the last person to go would count down 3, 2, 1, and then we'd all try to clap at the same time, which was kind of fun and dorky, but we fell in love with it, and four years later we're still doing it. Recently we've added, we all say yee-haw in unison afterwards, I can't tell you why. But trying to synchronize a clap via Zoom, and then all shouting yee-haw... I did this in a phone booth the other day and after I came out someone told me, "You know that those aren't as soundproof as you think," but when you get a good opportunity to give a yee-haw, you can't pass up on it, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):
I love these little things, they sound so minor, but they're such important elements of team culture and tradition, and so important for PMs to find ways to just have fun and do something ridiculous.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:25:58):
I will say, it took a while to get people behind shouting yee-haw, but now that we have people doing it, you can't take it away [inaudible 01:26:08], we all love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:09):
Oh man, I called our all hands for a while, y'all hands, feel free to steal that.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:26:14):
You get it, you get it Lenny. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:17):
I get it. Jackson, this is incredible, I feel like people are going to listen to this with notebooks, and just like, okay, here's a bunch of ideas we should try with whatever we're working on, whether it's streaks or not. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Duolingo? I know you're hiring product managers, so share more there, and finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:26:37):
Yes, you can find me on LinkedIn, that is where most of my online social media is, so Jackson Shuttleworth, and then how people can be useful to me, yes, as you said, we are hiring. We're actually hiring for my team. Are you interested in thinking about streaks as much as we do? We might be the right home for you, so please, you can apply on our website. We're also hiring from a number of other product management roles, and they're all as thrilling as this work is.

(01:27:05):
And then, I'm always interested about how other companies have implemented streaks and what they've learned, and so what I'd say is if you're a company who's implemented a streak maybe in a different way than Duolingo has, or you found a whole ton of success and another vector, another element of the feature that we didn't talk about today, I would love to know more. I used to catalog basically every streak I found out there, and as it's become more of a popular feature, it's just been hard to keep up on. So, if you have interesting streak insights to send my way, I would love to hear them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):
I love that, a collection of all the best ways of doing streaks. Jackson, just I want to say congrats to your team and you for having so much impact. This is like the dream of a lot of PMs and teams, is to see this much impact and continue to ship wins, and so congrats, nice work.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:27:57):
Thank you very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:58):
Thanks for [inaudible 01:27:59]. And with that, Jackson, thanks so much for being here.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:28:02):
Yeah, thank you Lenny, this was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:04):
Same. Bye everyone.

# Making time for what matters | Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (Authors of Make Time, Character VC)

## Transcript

Jake Knapp (00:00:00):
It's not really about productivity, it's not about time management. It's really just about, look, at any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not. The notion with the highlight is imagine it's the end of the day if someone asks you, "What was the highlight of your day," what would you say? That's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that, and you still feel really good about your days. You still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.

Lenny (00:00:37):
Today, I've got two guests, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. Jake and John are authors of two incredible books, Sprint and Make Time. With Sprint, they've helped more than 300 teams design new products and bring them to market, including teams at YouTube, Slack, Gusto and One Medical. Previously, John and Jake worked at Google Ventures, and before that, at Google, where John was a leader on Google Ads and YouTube. And Jake helped build Gmail and co-founded Google Meet. Today, they run a venture capital firm called Character, and they actually just opened up applications for their accelerator program called Character Labs, which you can learn more about at character.vc/labs.

(00:01:16):
In our conversation, we focus on their more recent book, Make Time, which a guest of this podcast, Ben Williams, recommended in the lightning round, and I absolutely loved and wanted to make sure more people learned about it and the advice within it, especially product leaders and founders who are constantly looking for ways to be more productive. I want to get you right to the meat of the conversation. So, let me just say that we get into a ton of very practical pieces of advice for how you can be more productive in your day, and if you listen to this episode, I guarantee you'll find at least three things that you'll want to start doing differently starting tomorrow. With that, I bring you Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:57):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers. Sidebar is a private, highly- vetted leadership program, where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback.

(00:02:38):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.

(00:04:13):
Jake and John, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jake Knapp (00:04:17):
Thanks for having us. We're so stoked to be here.

Lenny (00:04:20):
I was just re-listening to the audiobook of Make Time to prep for this conversation. And I feel like I kind of know you guys from listening to your voice for so long in the car, and it's a little surreal to be talking to you guys.

John Zeratsky (00:04:31):
That was really fun to record. And while we were doing it, we kept saying to each other, it was like we were recording the world's longest podcast.

Jake Knapp (00:04:39):
That's what it felt like.

Lenny (00:04:41):
Actually, on that, how long does it take to record audiobook? I've always been curious. How much time does that-

Jake Knapp (00:04:45):
Well, it takes twice as long as it should have because my stomach kept growling and the microphone would pick it up. And so, John would do a perfect take and we're both sitting in the little room together and the engineer was in the other room and he'd be like, "You got to do it again. You got to do it again. The guy's stomach keeps growling."

John Zeratsky (00:05:07):
I think it took two days, right?

Jake Knapp (00:05:09):
Yeah, I think it was two days. Yeah, and I think actually they thought it would take two days, so I don't think my stomach slowed us down too much.

Lenny (00:05:16):
That is not as long as I thought. I thought it was a month of recording and such a painful experience. Sounds like not so bad.

John Zeratsky (00:05:21):
No, honestly, it was really fun. I mean it's weird, but it's just like, I don't know, you can get into this very intense zone where you're singularly focused, right? There's nothing else that you need to do or should do, so it's just like read, drink tea, read, break for lunch, read, drink tea. It's just like this really satisfying flow.

Lenny (00:05:45):
That sounds like a great few days.

Jake Knapp (00:05:47):
Yeah, I think it was really fun doing it together too. I think it would've been harder to do... I mean obviously people do it and I think they like doing it on their own, but we've been working together for so long, it's always more enjoyable when we get to do something together. So, that made it cool.

Lenny (00:06:02):
Amazing. I want to do an audiobook now. That sounds like a lot of fun. So, to start diving into our conversation, so you guys wrote this very seminal book called Sprint, which we're going to talk about. But you also wrote this other book that I have right here called Make Time, that to me was even more powerful and I think it might be even more powerful in people's lives than Sprint. And I think it's one of the most interesting and most fun productivity books out there. My wife actually grabbed the book from my desk the past week as I've been prepping for this, and just started highlighting it. You could see all these highlights in here. She just goes-

John Zeratsky (00:06:36):
Awesome.

Jake Knapp (00:06:37):
Oh, that's so cool.

Lenny (00:06:38):
[inaudible 00:06:38] I want to be more productive. Also, a guest on the podcast introduced me to the book. At the end of the podcast, I'll ask you this too, but I ask people, what book do they recommend most to other people? And he mentioned this book, and so that's how I uncovered it. So, it all comes full circle.

Jake Knapp (00:06:49):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:06:50):
So, I thought we'd start with Make Time and then get to Sprint in the second half of the conversation. First question is just what do most people get wrong when they're trying to become more productive?

Jake Knapp (00:07:01):
To set the answer up, I'll give you a super brief history of Make Time. And for over a decade, John and I have been, in quotes, designing time as part of our work with startups, helping them find or expand product market fit. So, we developed a design sprint at Google Ventures, which the Sprint book is about. And now, we run this venture fund of our own called Character. And we run these highly-structured sprints with companies. And when we're doing that, we get to control how everything happens. We get to change the defaults of the way the workday happens, of what happens sort of hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute, how people are using technology, how people are interacting with each other. All those things are sort of under our control because we're trying to achieve these big goals in a really short period of time. Everybody focused.

(00:07:53):
So, as this stuff was going on, John and I started applying some of the lessons, the things that we found were working really well in those structured sprints. We started experimenting with applying those in our own day-to-day lives, and we found that some of those things were super effective and they were a bit counter to the way we'd sort of heard or learned about productivity. And there's all kinds of habit books and productivity hacks out there. And I think John and I have probably tried most of them, if not all of them. But it seems like 99% of the people who follow those things are still feeling overwhelmed, they're still stressed out all the time anyway.

(00:08:33):
So, even though we are not productivity gurus, this hasn't been like this thing we were doing forever, it's not our full-time job, but we thought we want to share this framework. So, Make Time, the book and the blog that proceeded it was just kind this side project to share what we learned. And yeah, it seems like it is resonated with a bunch of people. There's this kind of steady stream of interest in looking at these things a different way.

Lenny (00:09:00):
I love it. I love that it emerged out of the sprint concept. I know you talked about the book, but I forgot that and these are all very related. I also love that a lot of the best stuff comes from people actually doing the thing. This came from, "I just have discovered all these little things and I'm just going to share it." Not just like, "I need to write a productivity book."

John Zeratsky (00:09:16):
Yeah, I think, like Jake said, we both had always sort of been dissatisfied with the state of the productivity art, and we had big things we wanted to do. I mean, when you work in any kind of job, I mean we've both spent our early careers as designers and the job is really all about doing big projects. It's all about being able to focus, being able to spend time on the things that matter. And that's to say nothing of what we want outside of work, things that we want to learn how to do personally, people we want to spend time with. And it's interesting, we've found that when we talk to people about Make Time, they always know. They always know what they want to make time for. The problem is not like what should my goal be or how should I figure out what to do with my life? They usually know, but it's very hard to actually make time for those things.

(00:10:16):
And I think the problem is that most productivity advice focuses on getting better and faster about doing the things that are already in front of you. So, the messages that are in your inbox, the meetings that are on your calendar, a lot of focus on efficiency, like crank through that stuff. Our perspective is basically that those are the defaults. Just like our software that we use, apps that we use have defaults, those are the defaults of life, of the companies that we work in, the culture that we live in. And so, the solution is actually to change those defaults and to really flip this way of thinking on its head. So, it's not about how do I go faster? How do I get more efficient? It's about how do I put the thing that is the most important first in my day or in my life, and then build everything else around that and accept that you're going to need to do a bunch of those little things. You're going to need to answer those messages and go to those meetings, but really, start with the idea of what's most important to you? What do you actually want to make time for?

Lenny (00:11:25):
Along these same lines, we're going to talk about this kind of four-part strategy that you recommend, but a couple of things before we get into there. One is along the lines you just talked about is this insight that you had of just like willpower is never going to be enough to get you to make time for the things you want to do. And you had these two concepts of busy bandwagon and infinity pools, so maybe just talk about those two briefly.

Jake Knapp (00:11:47):
The idea of the busy bandwagon is just this expectation that everybody's busy. And in the United States, there's kind of this thing that I think if you travel abroad and talk to people for a while, then you come back, you'll notice, which is like if you ask someone, "Hey, how's it going? What are you up to?" And they'll be like, "Oh man, I'm busy." It's kind of the default answer. "I'm busy. Things are busy." And it means, usually, it could mean a variety of things, but usually it's good. Like, "Oh, it's busy, so business is booming," or, "It's busy, I'm overwhelmed," or whatever. But busy, it's kind of the expectations that everybody's busy. And we are, I mean we are busy, but we call it the busy bandwagon because it feels like you should be busy. And it's this inner feeling caused by what we see or perceive other people are doing that drives a lot of the stress. And I don't mean to sound like I'm above it all and have figured it all out. It still drives my stress, this inner feeling that other people haven't figured out, other people are expecting fast reactions from me, all this. That's the busy bandwagon, this sort of feeling that I should be busy, that everyone else is busy. And what that does inside of us is really the core of what we have to change and figure out, this getting out of a reaction mode. The other thing that happens to us are the infinity pools. And John, do you want to describe what infinity pools are in our context?

John Zeratsky (00:13:14):
Yeah, we came up with this name because we were trying to think of endlessly replenishing fount of content. So, basically if you can pull to refresh or if it streams, it's an infinity pool. So, this is pure entertainment stuff. This is stuff that people say like, "Oh, I spend so much time on Instagram," but it's also stuff that's important and necessary and productive. Email is a huge infinity pool and it's probably the single hardest thing for the two of us to control and avoid getting sucked into. And anybody listening to this is going to, I think, understand how powerful those pools are and how effectively designed and engineered those products are to be really compelling and to be friction-free and to just make it easy for us to dive back into that pool.

(00:14:15):
And so, when you put these two things together, the busy bandwagon and the infinity pool, you kind of have this, it's like a flywheel, but bad. You feel like you really need to be busy, you really need to be on top of everything. And then, you've got this whole collection of apps and services and products there that are ready to pounce on that, they're ready to take advantage of that set of defaults, that cultural and internal set of defaults that you have about what you should be doing. And for a lot of people, it just sort of spins out of control. So, our view is if you can name those two things, if you can understand those two things, then you can start to deliberately change some of the defaults around them, so that you can put your most important projects, people, work first, like we talked about.

Lenny (00:15:04):
I'm guilty of both these things. I feel like the reason I do some of these chats, this one in particular is it's like one-on-one coaching almost. This is going to help me stick to some of the things you teach. And I've already actually implemented a number of the things you recommend, but this is reinforcing it. And then, obviously, also helping all the listeners get better at these things. Before we get into it, one last question is just like real talk, how how's your guys' productivity? You wrote this book, it sounds amazing. There's 87 I think pieces of advice. How is it going for you guys? As we go through, I want to hear what you're actually using, but just broadly, how's your productivity?

Jake Knapp (00:15:40):
At the top of the interview, Lenny, you asked, "What do most people get wrong when they think about this productivity, time management, whatever?" And I'll frame my answer in those terms. So, most people, I think they try to get better and faster at doing what's right in front of them. We don't change the defaults in our environment, so we can focus and spend time on these different more important things. And if you think of that sort of what do I want to do? What's my goal? What do I want to spend time on that John referred to as project A, generally the things we want to do, these project A things, they're big, they're not easy to start, they're slow to create, dopamine hits, they're non-urgent. Like boss is not asking for them if you have a boss. And generally, the tasks and activities that stand in our way that keep us from doing project A, they're small, they're medium size, it's obvious how to start them, they create dopamine right away, they're supposedly urgent, email meetings, TikTok, Instagram, news, what's on your OKRs, all these things.

(00:16:47):
And I know what's on your OKRs may not sound like it's a peer of those others, but in a way it really can be. So, these big things, they're at odds with these little things that get in the way that the busy bandwagon expects us to do, these things that have infinity pools built in. And so for me, right now, it's a constant battle between the Jake and the busy bandwagon and my inner feeling of how can I live up to people's expectations of me and respond in the way that I should and react in the way that I should? And then, how can I do the project A stuff, the big important stuff? A lot has changed in my life since we wrote the book.

(00:17:28):
The summary is every few months I need a few new experiments. I have found in what has been some trying times that the tactics and the framework that we use... Because it's kind of simple and it sort of fits with these experiences that I've had for many years doing sprints, that it works. And that if I can go back to that, that if I can create space for it, if I can think about this as it's a series of experiments, if I can look at myself with curiosity and say, "Why are things not working out?" And then try to experiment my way out of it that I'm able to. But yeah, so at any given point in time, I probably give myself a B to B-, and sometimes it's a C and sometimes it's a D, and sometimes it's an A, and I'm really plugging away, but it's totally an ongoing challenge.

(00:18:22):
So, I'm not going to sit here and say, yeah, just follow me with a drone for 48 hours and you'll think that's exactly how you should do things. But part of our philosophy, I think that part of the way I look at it is it can be a mess. And yet, if you can create the space for those project A moments, for your highlights, that can shape everything else, if you just have those moments. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that and you still feel really good about your days, you still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.

John Zeratsky (00:18:56):
And having a framework for it gives you a path back. If you're just stuck and you're looking... You're sort of grasping for hacks. You're sort of like, "Oh, I read this blog post about this thing, I'll try it." That might have some short-term effect, but ultimately, you're probably not going to stick to it. You're probably going to fall back into that place of overwhelm and disappointment and burnout. But we find that if you have a system, that you can use the system and you can return to it and continue to build on and experiment, that you can make more sustainable progress on these things.

Lenny (00:19:33):
I think a really important takeaway from these two stories you guys just shared is you don't have to do all of these things. You don't even have to do most of them. If you just do one or two, if you find one or two things that can make you a little bit more productive every day, that makes a huge dent. And so, I think it's okay to feel like, "Oh, I tried this stuff. It didn't work." I think as long as you take a couple of things away today that might be useful to you, and then just try them again in the future. If they end up not working out. Like you delete an app and then you reinstall it, I think that's okay. So, I think that's an important takeaway from this is don't feel like you're failing if you're not doing all of the things that we're talking about today.

(00:20:10):
But let's get into it. There's this kind of four-part framework for how to help yourself be more productive. Basically, if you could just give an overview and then we'll just talk about each of these steps one by one. So, the four parts are create a highlight, laser, energize, and reflect. So, I'll turn it over to you guys just broadly, and then let's go through each of these one by one.

Jake Knapp (00:20:30):
It all starts with this notion of a highlight. And highlight is, I hate to say this, it's the most powerful best part, I think of the whole process. And I hate to say that because John came up with it. It wasn't even me. But I have to admit, it's really good. And I think as folks have read the book and shared it, that's the thing we hear back from people. If you could just do one thing from this book and try this out, it's a big deal.

(00:20:54):
The notion what the highlight is, start your day out and you imagine it's the end of the day, you're looking back on the day. If someone asked you, "What was the highlight of your day," what would you say? What do you want to say at the end of today was the highlight of today? And you start there, just like, "Okay, what would I like to say the highlight of the day was?" And you might think about what's urgent. Sometimes the highlight is this thing that really has to happen today. Today is the day there's a big meeting, or there's this thing I absolutely have to get done for work for tomorrow. That could be your highlight and getting that done well, having good attention to that will be very satisfying.

(00:21:37):
But a lot of times the highlight comes from joy or satisfaction, projects that wouldn't otherwise get attention. And it also doesn't have to just be something at work. It could be people in your life that you want to spend time with, a hobby that you want to spend time on. If you want to get better at Mario Kart, having a good session at Mario Kart, whatever might be the highlight of your day. The notion is just in the morning to think, "What is it and what is that highlight going to be?" And then, try to find a block that's 60 to 90 minutes. That's just usually the rough time we think it takes to really get in the zone on something, do a really excellent job, be totally focused on it. So, that highlight, that's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. And you start that way, you're now trying to shape your time around that highlight, and making sure that you have your peak energy, your peak attention when the time for that highlight comes around.

(00:22:37):
So, laser is about the tactics you might need to actually focus on that thing. In highlight, we have a set of tactics for how to create and think about and frame that highlight. Laser, we have a set of tactics for how do you pay attention when that time comes? Then for energize, it's about having the right amount of energy to do the thing, to pay attention. My highlight for today is trying to be coherent in this podcast, so this morning I need to think about what's the best way for me to have peak energy when a podcast starts.

Lenny (00:23:08):
That's my highlight too, actually. I have [inaudible 00:23:10].

Jake Knapp (00:23:10):
Oh, good. Right on. Okay.

Lenny (00:23:11):
Record a great podcast episode.

Jake Knapp (00:23:14):
Excellent, excellent. Okay. Yeah. And if you're not watching on video, Lenny had a sticky note and he wrote it down. So, that's actually literally the best way to do this is write it down on a sticky note, put it somewhere where you can see it. And so, you've got highlight, laser during the time of the highlight, energize, make sure you have the energy you need when the time comes. And these are just tactics around sleep and food and exercise, and just things that help with your mental energy, not crazy stuff. And then the final thing is reflect, and this is where we think about this as the scientific method. Did it work? Did what I tried today work out? And if not, just being curious about it, what didn't? And adjusting and trying to think, "Okay, maybe there's another tactic I can try."

(00:23:54):
So, the book is like... What are there like 87 tactics in the book? There's a lot of different approaches, but the expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that-

Jake Knapp (00:24:00):
... expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that all of them will work for each person. I use different tactics than John does, and some of his don't work for me, and vice versa. But that idea of centering on a thing, focusing on it, having tactics for that, having tactics for energy, and then having some tactics to reflect and reframe and be curious. That taken together, we find, just can reframe the way it feels. It's not really about productivity. It's not about time management. It's really just about, look, in any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention, and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not.

Lenny (00:24:47):
I think that last point is so important and why the highlight works so well for me is usually there's... You don't get anything amazingly done in a day, often. And usually, you're just distracted by all these things, and you're doing all the easy stuff. You talked about this idea of Project A, like here's the thing I really want to get done, but the dopamine hit us so far in the future, and it's so hard. And so, the reason I think the highlight is so powerful is, you get one thing done you're proud of, that is a great day. And it may sound crazy that that's true, but it's so true.

Jake Knapp (00:25:14):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:25:17):
So, I want to talk more in depth about each of these four things, and maybe spend the most time on the highlight and the laser because I think that's where most of the impact comes from.

(00:25:25):
So, with the highlight, do you have any advice? You shared a couple examples of how to come up with like, "Here's the thing to pick for the day." There's a few questions that you recommend, and I think you shared a couple of them. And then, are there any examples of highlights from your guys', I don't know, past couple of weeks that would be good for people to hear an example? And then, also, there's this calendar component, which maybe fits into the laser, but I guess that feels like a really important element of this. So, if you just talk about that?

John Zeratsky (00:25:51):
For me, and again, this is where the framework is intentionally flexible, different people have different highlights. But for me, I am very project oriented. I'm very work oriented. And for me, most days, a really good day comes from having made progress on something that is really important to me. So, my highlights are usually focused work, creative work related. And this has become even more important since we started our own VC firm three years ago. And before that, I was sort of, I guess, more or less a writer, full-time writing, and speaking at events, and doing some consulting. And before that, I was a partner at Google Ventures, at GV, and before that I was a product designer. So, I've been through different modes and contexts in my career. But if you know any VCs, if you're listening to this and you know any VCs, they're probably the busiest, most frazzled people that you know who are constantly on email, constantly in Zoom calls and meetings, and on airplanes all the time.

(00:27:08):
And so, the natural environment of that work is the busy bandwagon, and it's to have a lot of infinity pools that you need to care about. And so, in that context, in order for us to make progress on projects, in order for us to move the ball on a launch related to this program, Character Labs, that we run with pre-seed founders that's coming up, or we're writing a new book, and that's a big project, or working with one of our portfolio companies and running a sprint with them, or writing a newsletter that goes out to our LPs, those things are all really important, and I feel like they give us a unique edge as a VC firm.

(00:27:55):
If we accept the premise I said before, that most VCs are just sort of frantically running around, if we can take these bigger swings at things, then theoretically, they should really help us be successful. So, most of the time, it's all a very long way of saying that most of the time my highlights are like, "What do I want to accomplish at work? What is the thing that I want to get done today?"

(00:28:18):
And so, what I do then is, I structure my calendar around making time for that. There's a tactic in the book called Design Your Day that is really about kind of drawing out your day, and using your calendar as a canvas where you can design how you want to spend your time rather than using your calendar as a thing that is done to you, a thing that tells you what you have to do. Reclaim control over that.

(00:28:48):
And so, most days, the first half of the day before lunch is my focus time, and I protect that very, very intensely, and then use that time to work on whatever my highlight is.

Lenny (00:29:06):
We had a previous guest on, Neer Eyal, also talking about productivity, and he had actually the same advice of just using your calendar as your to-do list, basically, because that's where time's going to go, what your calendar's telling you to do. So, I think there's a pattern here that I think people need to pay attention to.

John Zeratsky (00:29:22):
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and I mean, we take it even further, and we have sort of a calendar template that we use as a team. So, we have certain times of the week. And it's not exactly the same for all of us on the team, but there are certain times of the week where it's like, yeah, this is when we do these kinds of things. This is when we have these kinds of meetings.

(00:29:43):
And not to say that those are all standing meetings, although we have some of those as well, but these are kind of the content buckets in the template that we can fill with a specific type of activity, but then other parts of the template are sort of reserved for focus work, reserved for individual, solo time to work on things that we need to get done.

(00:30:03):
So, yeah. I think the calendar is, at an individual level and especially at a team level, is this really powerful tool that most people just kind of... Not only do they not use it as a tool, they just sort of hate it. They're sort of like, "Ugh, my calendar, it's a mess. If I could live without a calendar, that would be the dream." But I think if you can use some of these tactics or use other approaches to reclaim it, and use it proactively as a tool for yourself, it can really help you structure your time around the things that you care about.

Lenny (00:30:41):
Yeah. The way I've been starting to use my calendar is this way, exactly, is I try to prepare for work on next week's newsletter post for like an hour and a half, then prep for the podcast coming up in a few weeks. So, it's very specific and broken up.

(00:30:55):
Along those lines, I often don't do these things as I planned. And one of your principles, something around Groundhog Day, it's okay to repeat it if you didn't do it. If you highlight you didn't do, just repeat it again and again until you do it. Right?

Jake Knapp (00:31:09):
I think that what's so cool about this notion of Groundhog Day. And if you've seen the movie... Well, if you haven't seen the movie, see the movie. What a great movie.

Lenny (00:31:09):
It was a good movie.

Jake Knapp (00:31:15):
If you've seen the movie, you know it's like, not to give it away, but he gets better and better at doing the day, and that's kind of this core philosophy that we take on.

(00:31:30):
I think a lot of the time, when in the past I have thought about, "How can I be effective with my time? How can I be productive?" It's beating myself up. It's not a good feeling to be in that head space of like, "I'm screwing up. What can I fix?"

(00:31:49):
And this notion that it's like, you're going to have another chance, you're going to have another chance. "It's okay, just try again, just be curious about what happened," is a big deal. And starting with the calendar, using the calendar as a framework for saying, "Hey, here's what actually happened. Here's what I think is going to happen." That's what you're saying when you do this Design your Day tactic.

(00:32:12):
And I did this exercise earlier this week. I was switching to a new calendar thing, and trying some new features with... We invest in this company called Reclaim, and they do this stuff-

Lenny (00:32:26):
I'm an investor in Reclaim also.

Jake Knapp (00:32:27):
Oh, well.

Lenny (00:32:28):
How about that? Not planned, this promotion.

Jake Knapp (00:32:33):
Yeah, little [inaudible 00:32:36] there.

John Zeratsky (00:32:37):
It sounds like we knew that, but we actually didn't know that. I didn't know that you-

Jake Knapp (00:32:37):
We did not know that.

Lenny (00:32:41):
How about that?

Jake Knapp (00:32:41):
That was just discovered. So anyway, I was just looking at my calendar, and I was like, you know what? I'm going to do what John does. When I wake up, I'm going to schedule when I exercise, when I eat breakfast. I'm going to schedule when I take a shower, everything, and block it all out. When I walk and feed the dogs, everything's going to be on there, so that then I can have this idea, and when the day starts, I know there's slots for all those things. And then I've found this week that what I thought happened, how long I thought those things take, was not how long they take. And so, set that thing to repeat every day and look at it, and then I'm like, "Oh, okay, interesting. That's not what happened."

(00:33:20):
Okay, so I can adjust it. I can adjust the template and be a bit more kind to myself about this part, be a bit more kind to myself about that part. Gosh, the morning time wasn't a good focus time for me. I'll see if I can... Is there a way I can make that block happen in the afternoon? It's just a helpful way to track stuff and see it.

(00:33:41):
Especially, I think a lot of people are visual learners. We can benefit from seeing things. It's not everybody, but a lot of us are in that camp. And when you put it on the calendar, you can see it, and that helps a lot.

Lenny (00:33:54):
And also keeps someone else from booking that time. Double win.

Jake Knapp (00:33:58):
Not to be undervalued, keeps someone else from booking that time. Right. And they look, they see, oh, okay, Lenny's already got stuff going on. I figured out, okay, I better be cautious before I ask for something. And that default, to be helpful to other people, and say yes when they put something on a free spot on your calendar, defeats a lot of our inner purposes.

(00:34:20):
And one core idea I don't think we've mentioned yet is that we strongly believe in people's intuition about how they should spend their time if they have the chance. What really is important. And that is true. We're talking about running this VC fund, or writing books, which are obviously very like, well, we're in charge of those things.

(00:34:39):
But this is also true, we've been employees in big organizations, I also believe it's true that if you have a boss, and a boss's boss's boss, that you have great insight about what, if you had a window of time, would be the highest leverage thing for you to do. And it might not show up on your OKRs, it might not be on your boss's radar, your boss's boss's boss's boss's radar. You have great intuition, and we want to create space for you to do that thing because you're going to feel better about it, you're going to be more satisfied, and also good things are going to happen.

Lenny (00:35:10):
We're spending a lot of time on this highlight, but I think it's because it's so powerful. It's such a simple idea, but so effective. So, just to kind of give people tactical advice for how to actually implement this, just a couple things that I'll summarize.

(00:35:23):
One is, to pick the highlight, you had a couple of questions I have here, for how to help you pick one for the day. So, you either ask which highlight will bring you the most satisfaction? Or, when I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? Maybe that's the same question. But I-

Jake Knapp (00:35:39):
Slightly different, slightly different.

Lenny (00:35:41):
Slightly different. That's true. Okay, good.

Jake Knapp (00:35:43):
Satisfaction could be like, "I know this thing has to get done, and I got it done."

Lenny (00:35:47):
Good point.

Jake Knapp (00:35:47):
Joy could be like, "Man, that was great." And they're in the same family, but they're cousins.

Lenny (00:35:55):
Great point, great point.

John Zeratsky (00:35:56):
Yeah. And I mentioned, a lot of my highlights, personally, are very much in the urgency or satisfaction camp. They're these big chunky projects. I got it done. I finished that deck. I finished writing that thing.

(00:36:11):
But I also try to stay attuned to when I need something else in my day, when I need... I need some joy. I need some fun, some play. I need to prioritize going for a run, or going for a walk, or cooking a big dinner. And so, I trust my gut on those things, and I say, "Okay, what's most important to me today is not to be productive, but to do something else."

(00:36:39):
And sometimes that's the best highlight for me. For other people, maybe that's their highlight every single day. Maybe they work as a... I don't know, I've talked to a lot of people who work in healthcare settings about this. They're a nurse or a doctor, and when they're at work, they're at work. They're not bouncing around between meetings and emails and Zooms. They're on their feet. There's no time to do anything else. So, their highlight is probably something they need to do at the end of the day to unwind, or take care of themselves.

(00:37:11):
So, you have these three different strategies that we talk about, urgency, satisfaction, and joy, as being three different places you can look for the right highlight for you each day. But ultimately, I think it comes down to just trusting your gut and sort of asking yourself, like you said, "What do I want to look back on and have said, yeah, I'm glad I made time for that"?

Lenny (00:37:33):
Awesome. So, you touched on the third. So, it's basically, what would give you the most satisfaction? So, in the morning, you essentially ask, or the night before. I think one of you, I forget, because when I was listening to the audiobook, I don't know who's talking. But one of you is like, "I like to do it the day before." Is that right?

John Zeratsky (00:37:48):
Yeah, that's me.

Lenny (00:37:50):
Okay. Okay.

Jake Knapp (00:37:51):
That's John talking.

Lenny (00:37:52):
Okay. So, the questions you asked either the night before or in the morning are, "What would give me the most satisfaction today, or the next day? What would give me the most joy? Or what's the most pressing thing that I need to get done?"

(00:38:03):
So, you do that, and then the advice is either write it on a Post-It... I actually bought these tiny little Post-Its by accident. I was trying to buy regular Post-Its, and they're actually really great for this specific use case, so it's perfect. Write your highlight, stick it on the monitor.

(00:38:17):
So, that's one way of doing it. The other is stick it in your calendar, where you have focus time. In theory, it's like every day, here's my focus time, where you have the most energy. Is that the general advice?

John Zeratsky (00:38:28):
Generally, although I think that that's probably more important for a certain kind of highlight. I have focused time most mornings. To be really specific and nerdy about it, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings I have focus time. Tuesday and Friday mornings I have meetings. But on a Thursday night, my highlight might actually be to have friends over and cook dinner. And that's not the same as focus time, but it's this pressure release valve where I'm like, "That's the thing that I want to make sure..." I want to make sure I wrap up email at 5 so that have time to get everything ready, but it's not necessarily that peak energy moment in the way that we might think about being productive or getting things done or getting into that flow state.

Jake Knapp (00:39:22):
Awesome.

Lenny (00:39:22):
So, there's a lot of ways to do it. So, maybe you just take away, if you're listening to this, is just think about what could be your highlight for today or tomorrow?

John Zeratsky (00:39:30):
Yeah. And I would say, go one step further and make sure to write it down. Don't just think about it, because there's something really special that happens when you write things down, even if it's on a sticky. Even if it's in your notebook, your journal, even if it's a note on your phone. Take that step as well.

Jake Knapp (00:39:50):
Even if you don't see it again, just writing it down is a big deal.

John Zeratsky (00:39:55):
Yeah, that's a really important point.

Jake Knapp (00:39:56):
I can give you a concrete example of a highlight, and a failed highlight, from yesterday, actually. And so, most days these days, my highlight is around making progress on the book. John alluded to working on a book, and so obviously it's a huge project. I heard it said that if you are writing books, it's like having homework forever. You always feel like there's always more to do. And so, that's mostly been my highlight.

(00:40:24):
But yesterday, I wanted to prepare for this podcast. I knew that was going to be satisfying, to feel like I was ready. We don't think about talking about Make Time all the time, like we said, it's sort of like a side project for us. So, I wanted to be ready and somewhat coherent. And I knew I'd be satisfied, but I also knew it was urgent. We're going to be doing the recording today. So, that was my highlight. Write that down. "Get ready for podcast."

(00:40:50):
And I had two focus blocks, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. It should be easy. Focus block number one, kind of just didn't do a good job. I was distracted, I was in my email, I was doing everything that I would say you shouldn't do, I was doing. Feeling down on myself. I've become a loser. I didn't get anything done.

(00:41:10):
Okay, second focus block. Man, now the pressure's on. I got to do it. And so, I finally get into the zone. And my wife thinks I have a pretty serious case of undiagnosed ADHD, so a lot of it is just, if I really do have a deadline, then I really will click in. So, now I have a deadline. I'm doing it, and I'm making notes, and getting there, but I feel like there's still a ways to go.

(00:41:32):
And my 12-year-old son bursts into the room, and it was, "Oh gosh, you're invading me right when I'm at peak focus." And he is like, "Hey, I'm going to do one more trip outside to sled in the snow. Do you want to come?" And I'm like, first reaction, "No, absolutely not. I can get this thing done. It's my highlight. This is the one thing I need to do today. I can do it max level of quality if I can just stay in this precious zone of focus."

(00:42:02):
But then I was like, "Wait a second, what's really going to be the highlight of my day? What's really going to be the highlight, the thing that I might actually remember in the future?" We rarely get snow here. I live on this island in Washington state. We maybe get significant snowfall once every two years. We've only lived here for a few years. He's 12. He loves snow more than anything in the world. He loves snow. But he grew up in California, so he hasn't had many days, and he's 12. He's on the cusp of being a teenager. There's not, maybe, any more days in his life that he's going to want me to get on the sled with him and wrap my arms around him and go down the hill.

(00:42:38):
I was like, "I got to get out there." So, okay. Pause this, ran outside. We did it. And man, it was magical. And I didn't know we were going to get one more in, because the snow was supposed to be melting already. We went down the hill, we went down the hill, we went... It got dark, we had to stop. But it was so magic. And I remember the very last end of the sled run, and it's like the last one, and he's like, "Man," he's like, "That was a great last sled run. So glad we did it."

(00:43:10):
And I was like, "Yeah, so glad we did it. It's great." Come back inside, 15 minutes. I try to hustle and get this done. So, I was like, maybe it was like 80% or 75% to where I wanted to be on this. I couldn't check off that highlight as being the most important thing. But because of the framing of, it might be wrong, what am I going to remember, all this stuff, it just felt natural to me to switch modes and say, "Oh my god, that actually is a highlight. That's this thing that's going to be really, really precious. That's where the joy and the satisfaction are most for today."

(00:43:47):
And still, because I had written down the other thing, I still did it instead of churning on email the entire day. But I screwed up twice, but it still turned out pretty good. So, anyway, that's kind of what it can look like at its best. And a lot of times, it doesn't make that much sense, and a lot of times I miss the special moments, or I miss the key work moments, or the key time when I could have gotten the most done. But I just feel better about it, which is a lot of what this is about. I just feel better about it because I feel more intentional.

Lenny (00:44:17):
Well, thank you for sharing the real talk. I think you made the right choice. I feel bad for having you have to decide between your kid and this podcast.

Jake Knapp (00:44:24):
You didn't have anything to do with it. No, no, no. I just wanted to... It's selfish for me to want to be prepared. I just want to look good. I just want to sound like I know what I'm talking about.

Lenny (00:44:32):
Well, it's working out. It all worked out. That's a great story. It reminds me, in your book at some point, I forget who it was of you that had to... You're like, "Here's my priorities in my life right now." And it was like family, writing, Make Time, something else, and then you're like, "Okay, actually Make Time is more important right now than my family," because you just have to get this done, and I wonder if this is a counter.

Jake Knapp (00:44:51):
Well, yeah. I mean, I think that part of what people have found useful about Make Time is that John and I come at this from different perspectives. And I have kids. I have a twelve-year-old and a twenty-year-old, sons, and dealing with being a dad is a big part of how I try to figure out how to make sense of what to do.

(00:45:13):
And John doesn't have kids, and so he has it easy. No, he doesn't, but that's just a different frame of mind. And I think sometimes I read something that people without kids wrote, and I think, "Well yeah, sure. I am sure that's wonderful for you, but what about X-Y-Z?"

(00:45:34):
And although, I'm sure a lot of people who have more kids, or when they have young kids, it would... But that's a real part of it. And whether it's your family, your significant other, anything that's going on in your life that's not part of your work, there are times when you, on a day, or in a moment, you have to shift those priorities. And it can help to just be this idea of stack-ranking things, and being clear about it, can help you just come to terms with it. "I'm making that decision right now. It makes sense to make right now." Or at least, I can see that I did it, and if it seems like I screwed it up, I'd flip it back. I know where it happened.

(00:46:14):
A lot of this is just like if you were designing a product or writing code or whatever, you can see that's where the bug happened. I'll just try to fix that line.

Lenny (00:46:23):
Yeah. I love how real you're getting, and it also reminds me of... We just had a kid. He's seven months old, so I'm going through a lot.

Jake Knapp (00:46:30):
Oh, congratulations.

Lenny (00:46:31):
Thank you.

Jake Knapp (00:46:31):
That's busy times. Seven months old is busy times.

Lenny (00:46:34):
Yeah, that's great.

Jake Knapp (00:46:34):
People always told me, told us, when we had kids when they were babies. They're always like, "Oh, just you wait." I just feel like this is a thing that people want to tell other parents. "Just you wait until this happens." And then one person said, "You know what? Generally speaking, it gets easier and easier and easier. Every month, every week, generally speaking, it gets easier." And I think that is true, so just keep that in mind if you're ever feeling like it's overwhelming.

Lenny (00:46:59):
No, I think that is true. I've experienced that. It also gets more amazing. That's what I'm finding, too.

Jake Knapp (00:47:03):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (00:47:05):
This episode is brought to you by Work OS. If you're building a SASS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where Work OS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.

(00:47:22):
Their APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by Work OS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

(00:47:35):
Work OS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to OP Zero, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.

(00:47:52):
It's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users. Check it out at work-

(00:48:09):
I want to talk about the next bucket that, you call it laser, you could also think of it as just how to focus better, and this is where most of the very tactical tips for how to avoid getting distracted are. So what I think might be helpful here is let's just do a rapid fire through as your favorite tactical tips to help people stay focused, and the ones that you actually do and find most helpful, I think it's like six years later now since you published the book, the better. So let's go through some stuff here.

John Zeratsky (00:48:37):
Yeah, the basic principle with laser is that willpower is never going to win, and there's great research on this, but for now just trust me, you're not going to white-knuckle your way through not looking at Twitter when you're trying to work. So it's all about making it hard, creating barriers to getting distracted. So a few things for me, I'm not on Instagram and I'm not on Facebook. I was on both of those things and I left both of them, I disabled my accounts. I am on Twitter and LinkedIn, but I don't have either of those apps installed on my phone. I stay logged out of those sites on my computer, except for when I want to use them for some specific purpose.

(00:49:22):
LinkedIn I need to use all the time, because I'm a VC and I have to look people up and stuff, so I found this Chrome plugin, or Chrome extension, I guess is the right word, that disables the feed in LinkedIn. So when I go to LinkedIn.com, it's the search bar at the top but there's no feed, which is amazing because I can use LinkedIn as the phone book and then not get distracted. So those are some of the very, very concrete specific things that I do, all, again, with the goal of putting a speed bump between me and that thing so that if I go, and I don't do this much anymore but I used to, literally my hands on the keyboard would just be like, T-W-I, like Twitter.com, and then you see that log in screen instead of my juicy feed and I'm like, oh yeah, right, okay, I did that on purpose, great, I broke that feedback loop a little bit.

Lenny (00:50:18):
I did a similar thing with Twitter/X, where I deleted the app and I just used the mobile website. I think this point of logging out is really powerful, I think people haven't heard that idea as much, because it's not like you can't log in really easily, you just click a couple things and you're back. But to your point, it reminds you, okay, I see, I really shouldn't have done this.

John Zeratsky (00:50:37):
Well, I also signed up for two-factor authentication for everything, not because I care about somebody hacking my account, but because it's another speed bump. Because that way, even if your browser remembers your password, or I use one password, so even if the browser extension is going to fill it in for me, there's still another step, so it's sort of reverse engineering my own distractibility.

Lenny (00:51:03):
That feature that everyone's always talking about that Apple built of the code being automatically there in the keyboard, that's counter to this friction that you've created.

John Zeratsky (00:51:11):
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

Lenny (00:51:12):
Okay, so it's interesting is I had this, and then I just like, goddammit I really just want to be on Twitter. And so I just re-installed it again recently, and I need to fight that again.

John Zeratsky (00:51:22):
Well, I go through cycles like that too, and I go through that a lot with email. Jake, you still don't have email on your phone, is that right?

Jake Knapp (00:51:33):
No, I would be on the floor checking email right now on this call if I did, on the floor.

John Zeratsky (00:51:38):
I used to do that, Jake inspired me a long time ago to remove email from my phone, and so for years and years that's been my default. But more recently I've had more reasons to install it, mostly related to travel, if I'm on the go and I just want to stay on top of things. And something that Jake and I have talked about a lot is you go through these different cycles of, hey, I need this thing, or I want this thing, and then part of the reflect step, part of paying attention and reflecting on how it's going is to recognize, oh wow, I've actually been spending a lot of time on email on my phone, or a lot of time on Twitter, maybe I'll just uninstall it for a while. Maybe I'll just reset and do that for a while. And then there'll be some other thing that happens that causes you to reinstall it, and that's totally fine, because you're being deliberate about it and you're paying attention, rather than saying it has to always be this way forever and it's set in stone.

Lenny (00:52:35):
That's a great tip of just coming back to it, not feeling like you're defeated, it's like, all right, let's try this again.

Jake Knapp (00:52:40):
Yeah, I think a big part of it is if you can experience the feeling of not having it on your phone. Like I'm old enough to have lived in a world building products where there were no smartphones, and we got a lot done back then, things happened. I mean, for God's sake, they designed the first iPhone without being able to use iPhones while they did it, you can do a lot. So this idea that we have to have it or everything's going to fall apart, that's just not true for 99.99999% of everyone.

(00:53:16):
It's interesting to see what it feels like if you delete all of the infinity pools off of your phone, and this is something I did out of rage at myself in 2012. It was another situation where I was with my kids, who were much younger at the time, and I was spending time with them, we're playing wooden trains, and all of a sudden my son's like, "Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad," and I'm like, "God, what?" And I didn't even realize it but I was on my phone, and I don't even remember what I was doing, email or something, but I think I told him, he's like, "What's on your phone?" Because to him, he was like, we're doing something really fun, so if you're on your phone it must be something really cool, maybe it would be a cool thing to share, because this is great, so it must be another great thing. He wasn't trying to shame me or anything.

(00:54:06):
And I was all defensive, I'm like, "Well, I need to do this for work," which was, I think, my internal monologue of why I was doing this thing that actually was just a really low-friction dopamine hit. And then I thought, God, this is not what I wanted, this is not why I worked so hard today so I would get done with my work so I could be home in time to do this before my kids go to bed. And I was like, screw this, so I just started deleting things on my phone, and I deleted email and I deleted Facebook and I deleted this, everything that had an infinity pool, everything that had an infinite amount of content. News is like this, anything streaming.

(00:54:44):
When we wrote this book, it came out in 2018, I think we said we thought it was going to get worse, and it has. But at that point in time there was really Netflix, and now there's all these streaming services. At that point in time there was Instagram and Facebook, but now there's TikTok, the best part of every video available instantly right here. This stuff, it only gets harder to resist. When you clear all that stuff off of your phone, it's painful, the idea of deleting all this stuff, and each time the phone's going to ask you, "This is going to delete all the data and settings, are you sure you want to do that?" It doesn't want you to. And when you do that though, what does that feel like? And it's usually a feeling of discomfort, but also relief that I don't have to check this, this thing, I don't have to check it, I don't have to.

(00:55:34):
And if you've ever felt like your phone was in the Lord of the Rings, how Bilbo, I guess, yeah, Lord of the Rings, they want to put their hand in their pocket and touch the ring, or put the ring on without even knowing it, Frodo's like, "I didn't even realize I did it." That's what this thing is like. And when you take those off, just that feeling of relief is, to me, so powerful, that having done this for a decade now, and yeah, there's exceptions, like I'm traveling, God, I have to check my email for X reason, and I install it and I check it. And then it automatically, because I'm aware of it, I'll just feel this static.

(00:56:11):
There's this notion of attention residue, and I think the researcher who coined this term is Sophie Leroy from the University of Washington. Anyway, you can look that up, I think I learned about that from Cal Newport. But this idea says, it makes a lot of sense, that you pay attention to some things and they just stick in your head and they create this static, those apps just create this static. The idea of email being on my phone and accessible at any time creates a discomfort, a disquiet that now that I've seen it and felt what it's like to not have it, I could not imagine experiencing it.

(00:56:44):
You do give some things up. You're not going to be as responsive. John and I don't have as many Twitter followers as we'd have if we used Twitter. There are these things that you look at other people, and I just saw a post on LinkedIn because I haven't used plug-in yet, but I looked on this post and it was a colleague that I used to have and she was saying, "Yeah, I posted a few tweets last year and a couple of them went viral and I gained 30,000 followers." And I was like, man, all I have is 30,000 followers, and that was from years and years ago, I thought I was a pretty big deal, oh jeez, maybe I should... And I was like, oh God, don't do it, because I know when I'm doing it, then I'll be thinking about it all the time and the attention residue will spoil my life.

(00:57:28):
So yeah, anyway, sorry, that's just a rant, but you should try it. The distraction-free phone thing is just worth trying, if you can take off everything, if not just try taking off the thing that's your kryptonite. What's the thing that is the hardest for you to resist, sucks your attention the most, makes you feel not good? Take it off for, try it for a day, or try it for two hours, just to feel that feeling. And then once you've felt the feeling you'll always know, I could release that, and I think that's powerful.

Lenny (00:57:57):
And I think when you delete it, it's important to know nothing's being deleted when you're deleting the app, you can reinstall it, you log in, it's all the same.

Jake Knapp (00:58:04):
It's all the same, that's an important point. They make it sound like, oh my God, this is a big deal. It's not.

Lenny (00:58:09):
Yeah, just have to remember your password or Google auth, or whatever you're using. This metaphor of The Lord of the Rings and the ring is so good for how it feels to just say, I'm just going to check Twitter, what's the problem, I'm just going to check it again, I'll just check it, check it. That's so good. And then in Lord of the Rings, the way they resist the ring is they hide it, they put it somewhere else, they give it to Frodo to take it, right? That's the same solution, it's just like, I can't get access to it, it's over there.

Jake Knapp (00:58:36):
Right, right. Yeah, you got to be like Gandalf. Even if that ring would do great things for you, you got to give it to Frodo for a while, maybe show up at the end with an eagle.

Lenny (00:58:45):
Just too eerie, yeah, yeah, the eagle.

Jake Knapp (00:58:46):
Scoop them up.

Lenny (00:58:47):
Yeah, oh man. So the key tips here are find the apps that are sucking your attention, could be Twitter, could be LinkedIn, could be your email, and delete them and/or log out of them. What else?

John Zeratsky (00:59:00):
There's a few tactics that Jake and I both use that are related to TV, watching TV, and a really simple one, which is also kind of a luxury one, but I think there are ways to do it that are pretty universal, is just not having a TV in your main living space. Again, not having the default be like, I'm home, the TV is on, what are we watching? And so for me and my wife, that's always been the TV is just in a different room. And Jake, do you use a projector where if you want to watch something you have to get it out, set it up, and make a decision to watch something?

Jake Knapp (00:59:40):
Yeah, so it's a bit of a project. And it doesn't take that long, but you definitely are not just click, and you don't see it when it's not set up. So we have a projection screen that's all folded up in the corner, and the projector's in a cabinet, so you got to get it out and get a chair and put it on there. If you're motivated enough you can do it, but it takes a few minutes.

Lenny (01:00:06):
You need an old-timey camera that you have to wind.

Jake Knapp (01:00:06):
Yeah, right.

Lenny (01:00:07):
Someone has to sit there.

John Zeratsky (01:00:11):
Here's another one that-

Jake Knapp (01:00:13):
[inaudible 01:00:13] in the back.

John Zeratsky (01:00:15):
Yeah, right. Another one that's really helpful for me that actually is sort of a bridge is the laser section and the energized section, because it relates to sleep, is I don't keep my phone in the bedroom. The phone doesn't come in the bedroom. And not only that, the place where it charges, the MagSafe little charging place for it, is downstairs. It's on a different floor, it's in the kitchen. So when I put that there at the end of the night and I go upstairs, I might still be awake for an hour, I might read, I might get ready for bed, all those things, but the phone is a way to make sure that the last thing I do each day is not on my phone. That's super helpful to me, and I think there's a bunch of ways, whether it's in a drawer or in a cabinet, there's a bunch of ways you can implement that tactic that I think could make a big difference.

Lenny (01:01:07):
My wife and I have been talking about that actually, but the issue is to watch our kid with the Nanit app we need our phone. I know that you can get other devices that aren't on the phone, but we just like the Nanit, and so we've stuck with that.

John Zeratsky (01:01:20):
Yeah, one tactic that's related to that that a lot of people have told us they've had success with, and not specifically with the Nanit app, but some people have said, "Oh, I can't uninstall those apps because," Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever, "because I do social media for my work. Literally my job is I do marketing at the company, I have to be on social media." So what some people will do is they'll have a separate device. So it's almost like the old days of your personal phone and your work phone, they'll just have a work device, like a work iPad, that those apps are only there, and when they're working they're on it, when they're not working they put it away. So you could have another device that's the Nanit device and that's all it does and it's in a nice little stand by the bed, that can create some separation as well.

Lenny (01:02:09):
That's a great idea. I think there's a company, I think it was Arianna Huffington made a thing where it's a little bed for your phone, where you put it somewhere in the living room and you put it to bed and you charge it there and it's outside your room.

John Zeratsky (01:02:21):
Yeah. There's a company, I can't think of the name right now, but I can look it up and send it to you, there's a company that makes a cool box that not only you put your phone in, it charges, but it has some sort of way of, it interacts with the phone, it puts it into Do Not Disturb, or there's some cool integration that it does. So yeah, those things are a little bit gimmicky, but if it helps you create that default, I think it's worth it.

Lenny (01:02:48):
Here's the trick my wife wanted to share with you guys as she was reading the book, she's like, "Tell them about this thing that we've been doing," which is with TikTok. She doesn't install the app, and she basically relies on me to send her TikTok videos I like to her account, which she then checks on my phone.

Jake Knapp (01:03:04):
You're Frodo.

Lenny (01:03:05):
Yeah, yeah, I'm holding the TikTok, my precious. And so the trick there, there's two wins, one is she only sees the best stuff. She respects my taste of videos to watch. And then two is I'm always like, "Give me my phone back," and so there's limited time where she can watch them, and that keeps her from getting addicted to TikTok.

John Zeratsky (01:03:27):
Yeah. My wife and I have a similar dynamic, but in reverse and with news. I spend very little time reading the news, and I don't have any news apps on my phone, but my wife's pretty into the news. She has a healthcare background and she studied journalism in school, so she loves particularly those two topics in the intersection of those two. And so she gives me a news digest. When we're chatting at the end of the day, or when we're doing something together, she'll just, it's not structured, it's not some official thing, but she just shares what she was reading about that day. It's nice, it gives us something to talk about, I think it suits both of our styles and our preferences. It's good for her, it's good for me, so it's fun to think about how you can implement some of these ideas in a relationship as well.

Lenny (01:04:23):
How do I subscribe to this feed of your wife sharing the news every day? It sounds like a great podcast we all need.

Jake Knapp (01:04:29):
Really, really good stuff, or really important stuff, will find us. I think there is, part of the busy bandwagon, or part of the infinity pools thing, is this feeling inside that I'm responsible for staying up to date with the most important news in the world, or the most important news in my inbox, or my company or my team, work, and I'm responsible also for getting the very best of entertainment that's out at this moment that's the most topical and the funniest, or the most interesting, whatever, at this moment.

(01:05:04):
And it's okay to let go of that and, the good stuff, it'll come to you. People will share it with you or you'll hear about it. If it's a really big news story, you'll hear about it eventually. If it's going to affect you, actually, you'll hear about it. And with most news, and most entertainment, we don't play a role, it's hard to admit, but we don't actually play a role in what happens, and so the idea that we're responsible for being on it all the time, that's a job that we can quit, or at least take a sabbatical from.

Lenny (01:05:38):
So Tim Ferriss talked about this in The 4-Hour Workweek, is way back in the day is just like, I wait for people to tell me what I need to know, exactly what John just shared before this, and I find this with, so first of all you find that when you delete Twitter, LinkedIn, you go week without it, and nothing is any different. You still know everything you need to know, your job, everything's going great. You missed a bunch of stuff that had no impact on your life. And so I think doing that exercise helps you realize that and I don't need to be on Twitter all the time.

(01:06:08):
And not to get political, but with news about Trump, there's always these headlines, "Trump, look what he did in this lawsuit today, it's over." I just feel like there's so many posts about all these things Trump is doing every day, and none of them, nothing happens. It's just the same thing, just keeps going. If something actually happened there I would hear it from a lot of people, the New York Times would send me a big push. So it's like, I don't need to know all these things he's doing every day.

Jake Knapp (01:06:36):
Well, it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is, that is true. Trump is always going to be in the news, and it's always going to, that's the constant, that's the third constant, death, taxes, and Trump will be in the news.

John Zeratsky (01:06:51):
A related tactic that I've been doing for a long time is my main source of news is the Economist magazine, which is far too highbrow for what I need, but the main feature of it is that it's weekly, because at the end of the week, the zillion stories about Trump, or whatever, if there was something of consequence, it gets distilled into this really good summary. Really, really good. The Economist has some of the best journalists in the world, they're just absolutely fantastic, and so not only does it have this really nice cadence of once a week, if something matters it's going to get rolled up there, it's going to get summarized. And so that's one of my most durable habits related to these tactics, is reading the news once a week, reading the Economist. It fits my brain, it fits my life rhythm really well.

Lenny (01:07:54):
Yeah, it's the opposite of Twitter, basically.

John Zeratsky (01:07:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:58):
So yeah, let's hear a couple more tactics and then let's touch on the other two parts of this framework.

Jake Knapp (01:08:03):
Well, first a pairing, and then one more. The pairing is reset expectations and slow your inbox. So these are two tactics related mostly to the email and messaging. So resetting expectations is just about having maybe a conversation with people you work with, but it can be as simple as a signature in your email. And so one great example of this is a signature that says, I'm checking email two times a day as an experiment to improve my focus, or I'm checking email once or twice a day, you decide how spicy you want to get with this option, because I'm working on an important project. And just a simple line that people will see passively as you send emails that will reset their expectations of how quickly you'll respond. And if you like you can say, I'm checking email once a day because I'm working on a big project, you can text me if it's urgent. Feel free to text me, you can invite people to do so.

(01:09:11):
But that very act of just putting it in there, you can also do it as an out of office autoresponder, so just like, hey, instead of I'm actually out of the office like, hey, I'm going to be slow to respond to email because I'm working on an important project. That because is really important, and we talk in the book about this, a funny study about the power of because and this case where people would make up bogus excuses, but they'd say, "Because to cut a line," it's an old study, they're making photocopies, but they would cut the line and say, "I need to cut the line because I need to make copies." And just saying because dramatically boosted the percentage of the time that a person would let them cut the line. We're suckers for explanations, all of us. So if you say because people will feel better, and you can feel better about saying it.

(01:09:58):
But this idea that you're just going to put up a placard, basically, that says, hey, I'm slow to respond because I'm working on a project, and maybe give people an escalation path, or don't, that's a huge deal. And it seems like it would be a huge deal because it changes others expectations, and that is true. But the real power of it is in changing our own expectations about what we are going to do and what we are expected to do. Most of the stress comes internally, from our feeling that if we don't get back to people right away, we're not enough, we're not measuring up, we feel some kind of shame or guilt about not doing it and not being fast and not being responsive. And so doing this statement is just about renegotiating with ourselves.

(01:10:46):
The other one is to slow down your inbox. This is a simple one, if you start to do that, if you start to just check your email once or twice a day, or even less frequently, or even if you check it a little bit more frequently but you aren't responding to emails, you don't hold yourself accountable to this idea of an empty inbox, then the whole loop slows down. If you respond to emails really fast, you respond to messages really fast, people respond back to you and then there's more to respond to. And if you slow down that little hamster wheel, it slows down. And so that's powerful too. So those two around email I think can be really helpful, they help me with this, my default feeling about email and messaging and everything is I should be as responsive as possible, and I have to constantly renegotiate that with myself, and those are ways I do it.

(01:11:36):
This other one that's pretty extreme, that I only just tried for the first time, it's in the book but I hadn't actually tried it, but this was a reader of our blog told us about this. Her name is Krissa, I think she allowed us to use her first name but not her last name. So Krissa, if you're listening, shout out to you, this turned out to be a great tactic, but it's to cancel the internet. And she had canceled the internet at home, which is wild. But what I did was I have an office, a very small office in this small town here where I live, and-

Jake Knapp (01:12:00):
Small office in this small town here where I live and I canceled the internet there so that I could, when I went there, all I can do are tasks that you can't do with the internet, which is a lot. I mean, you can use a lot of apps in offline mode and it's a great place for me to write. It's a great place for me to do focus work, design something, presentation, but any kind of focused thinking, reading, writing can happen there and now the whole feeling of stepping into that room where I cannot access the internet is insane.

(01:12:32):
To create this kind of a thing at home, you can do things like put a timer on your internet. You can actually buy one of those vacation timers, plug it into the wall, plug your router into that, and it will actually switch your internet off at a certain hour or hours. There's also software that'll let you do this selectively, but the big notion of just having there be a time when you are off and it's a fairly significant pain to get back on again, it's more than just clicking wifi on, wifi off. I find for me that's not enough of a speed bump. It's pretty powerful.

Lenny (01:13:07):
Just the way you're describing the feeling of walking into an office that has no internet, I totally feel that. Just imagine, just like, "I have no internet here. I could do so many things. I could read."

Jake Knapp (01:13:19):
It might be a coffee shop where you don't find out what the wifi password is and there's just this amazing, amazing feeling. Maybe it's just you go to a park where there's no wifi, just whatever it might be, finding a place where you can't, you just can't get that stuff. Leave your phone at home if you can't bear to delete all the apps. It's so great. It's so great. And then you're not fighting the battle.

(01:13:46):
A lot of this stuff, there's a visualization I think of where I've got the highlight in front of me. It's right there. This thing I can see that I want to do, but it's like five feet away or 10 feet away, and right next to me just kind of vibrating are all of the... You can imagine all the app logos, they're just kind of vibrating right around my head.

(01:14:07):
They're right there and touching any one of them, it's like they're little pieces of candy. It's all going to feel good. There's this really good meal, five to 10 feet away is this great sandwich, but these little pieces of candy are right in my face and it's going to be hard to resist just popping a little Sour Patch Kid or Laffy Taffy in my mouth, but if I could push them away, if I can just push them far enough away so that there is far away or farther away than the sandwich, I'm going to eat the sandwich. And Mike, if that's what you do basically with these barriers to these distractions, then you can get into laser mode and it's easy. You want to. Once there's space, you'll want to do the thing that's most important. It's just it's hard because the candy is right in our face.

Lenny (01:14:50):
Such a good metaphor. You also have this metaphor of Odysseus sailing past the sirens. If folks know that story where there was a siren, I don't know, cliff thing where he's just sailing.

Jake Knapp (01:15:01):
I know well, in eighth grade I played Odysseus in school play, so I can tell you all about it.

Lenny (01:15:06):
Man, what a character to play. Yeah. And in that story, he wanted to experience these sirens who nobody could resist, but he forced his sailors to tie him to the ship and not allow him to do anything, even though he's like, "Let me go. I need to go there." Because everyone crashed into the sirens. Anyway, I'm doing a bad job explaining this story, but I think it just comes back to the same point again and again that you can't rely on your willpower to not go towards these vibrating candies all around you that you need to set up these systems.

Jake Knapp (01:15:41):
I think there's this notion that we will use willpower maybe comes from the fact that some people can, maybe some people are just using willpower or they're on Twitter, they're on Instagram, they're on TikTok, they're on Facebook, they're doing all these things, and they're also functioning just fine, or at least what we see from the outside is just fine. But maybe internally too, it's fine.

(01:16:07):
It just seems that everybody I actually talk to and certainly my personal experiences, all that stuff makes me feel bad and actually undercuts my ability to do the things that are meaningful. The meaningful contributions I can make through my work or through my life, whatever. They're all undermined and undercut by the bad feelings and the distraction that come from all of social media, all of the news and almost all of my email. And so if that's true for anybody, if it's even remotely true for us, we have to just radically rethink what we're doing.

(01:16:42):
This thing, I think we basically are steered toward becoming reaction machines and this notion of, "I'm going to have an empty inbox. I'm going to do every task. I'm going to be a fast responder, I'm going to be in every meeting. I'm going to do that because I want to help other people, and that's the way it works." I think this desire to be helpful is a big driver of it. I think we want to alleviate our stress and other people's stress, and that seems like the right way to do it. It's candy. Some of the stuff is candy and easy.

(01:17:12):
We also see this modeled by people in power, so like CEOs and bosses, it works for them because they're applying their influence through being constantly reactive and being in meetings all the time. That's just how they do what they do. That's how they apply their influence. But even for them, I think it has limits as a way to apply influence. At the bare minimum for the rest of us. And for those of us who again, I think is the vast, vast majority for whom all of these things create problems and we're not able to easily willpower and self-esteem manage all this stuff, if we're a reaction machine, we're not doing meaningful work, no Project A's and we're not really alive as humans. We're just chat bots. So it's worth experimenting if you don't want to live your life out as a chatbot.

Lenny (01:18:00):
I think the point you made there around the feeling is just a really important point that even if you feel really productive enough and you're getting things done, is if you're feeling bad, it's still an important thing to focus on. This idea of, are you spending time on things you want to spend time on? You also reminded me of this app I'll mention briefly that I think you guys will love, I don't know if you've heard of this. It's called mailmanhq.com. It shuts off your Gmail for periods of time. So you could say, "Only allow my email through at these times of day." And so instead of email whatever, it's just like you can batch your release of email.

Jake Knapp (01:18:35):
That's beautiful. Mailman HQ?

Lenny (01:18:37):
Mailman hq.com.

Jake Knapp (01:18:39):
Okay, I'm writing that down right now.

Lenny (01:18:40):
Yeah, I go on and off it because sometimes I just want on an email, but it makes a big difference. It's wild how just not even knowing your email makes a big difference.

Jake Knapp (01:18:49):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:18:50):
Okay. Let's touch on the last two parts of this framework, energize and reflect, and then let's spend a little time on Sprint for people to get a sense of what this method is all about. For folks that haven't read the book.

John Zeratsky (01:19:03):
So to replay the system overall highlight is about the thing you want to make time for today. The most important thing today, laser is about creating barriers to distraction so that you have much your energy or as much of your attention as possible to focus on your highlight on that one thing. Energize is sort of like a booster to laser.

(01:19:29):
It's sort of like the big idea is that our brains and bodies are connected and our ability to pay attention and to focus and to do those things that we care about only works when we are well and we have slept, we have eaten well, we have exercised, we have talked to other people the right amount, not too much, not too little and so we put this as part of the make time framework because we don't think you should go crazy, try a million biohacker type of things, but we do think it's worth applying this same philosophy of pay attention to what's working, what's not, have a system, try some new things, pay attention to those things, run these experiments. We think it's worth doing that for your health, for your energy as well, because it really does make a difference.

Lenny (01:20:27):
Maybe share one or two tips there real quick for people to energize to create a little more energy during their day?

John Zeratsky (01:20:33):
In the year since we wrote the book and as my life has just continued to change and I've gotten a little bit older, I've realized that sleep is probably the single most important thing. I mentioned earlier, not having my phone in the bedroom, no TV in the bedroom, hopefully that goes without saying, but just being able to really construct an environment that allows me to sleep. I started wearing an eye mask recently.

Lenny (01:21:01):
I do that.

John Zeratsky (01:21:02):
Yeah, really helps me fall asleep and stay asleep and then the other thing is exercise is a big source of energy for me, but I realized that I was making excuses about why I didn't need to or shouldn't exercise in any given day. So even though this is not what we recommended in the book specifically, I ended up signing on with a personal trainer so that I have accountability, I have a schedule, I have somebody who's thinking about what I need that's not just me and those two things have kind of been the pillars of how I build energy over the last few years.

Lenny (01:21:47):
I use this app called Future, I'm a investor, quick disclaimer, but it's basically a personal trainer through an app that's like a real person that helps you design a workout for you, and then they give you the workout on the app and you just follow the instructions and that's the thing that got you working out three times a week.

John Zeratsky (01:22:03):
Nice. Yeah.

Jake Knapp (01:22:04):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:22:04):
Killing it. Okay. And then within reflect, maybe just briefly talk about the importance there and then one thing people could do to reflect on how things are going.

Jake Knapp (01:22:14):
Reflect is just simply the act of looking back on the day and treating the day. It wasn't marble gravestone of your successes or failures, it's just a experiment that you ran. What happened in the experiment? Taking note of it in that lens, what did it look like? There's a template in our book that has some questions you can answer, but really it's pretty simple.

(01:22:44):
If you write down your highlight in the morning or the night before, if you're draw it and you stick it somewhere visible, then at the end of the day you just look at it and just like, "Okay, did that happen or did that not happen?" If you stick it somewhere visible, you won't even have to do anything. You'll just come across it and you'll know if did that happen or not? So that's the simplest part of it is writing it down, sticking it will create a reflection loop for you.

(01:23:14):
Another thing that I think is quite powerful at the end of the day is to write down, keep a notebook by the side of the bed and write down one or two or three things that you are grateful for during the day, just like a simple gratitude journal. And you'll start, this keeps you in this frame of mind of what was cool today, what happened that was satisfying or joyful, what brought me joy and then if you start the day thinking about what you'd like to happen and then you look back and say, "What was great?" Your brain is just starting to look for those good things. Look for those big highlights, and that's a great way to live your life day to day saying, "This is what I hope will happen. This is what did happen. Now I'm more tuned into what it might happen tomorrow. Oh, now I'm more tuned into what happened today." And again, and it's just a really nice loop. So was there a connection between what you hoped would happen? Did you manage to do your highlight? If so, what helped you do it? What worked or didn't work? What made it hard? It might be an energy thing that suggests a tweak to when you drink coffee or if you take a walk or whatever. It might've been a focus thing. So maybe I'll try another barrier for this thing because that undercut me. Whatever it is, it's just basically, in summary, curiosity about your day instead of self-judgment about your day.

Lenny (01:24:30):
I think we've covered Make Time and tons of depth if people want to practice these things, highly recommend getting the book. It's called Make Time and it's really quick to read and it's basically just a long list of things you can do and we talked about a lot of them. There's a lot more. And I think part of the premise of the book is try stuff, see what works, see what doesn't. Keep reflecting, iterating, some of these things, even if you find two things that change how productive you're, that's a huge win.

Jake Knapp (01:24:55):
I highly recommend people get the book. That's great. And it's our best attempt to put together a how-to guide for doing this stuff. For what it's worth, we're not really motivated to try to create a self-improvement empire. This is not our full-time job. We just hope it works for you and is useful. So if you don't want to buy the book, we get it. Go to maketime.blog and just check out some of the experiments and things that are available there or just try one or two of the things that we talked about today. Try the highlight. If you're going to do one thing, just try right now writing down what you want your highlight to be, either for today or if it's late in the day for tomorrow on a sticky note and put it somewhere that you'll see it tomorrow.

(01:25:41):
Just that is a great step in the right direction. Try having a conversation with your colleagues or putting a signature or an autoresponder in your mail that says you're going to slow down or talking to them about slowing down at character. At our VC fund, we had a conversation and decided we're going to try to have our main communication happen in Notion so that if we're talking about something, it's in a form, it becomes a document, and the expectation of how you react and respond there is going to be different than in a tool that's designed to get you responding as fast as possible, like an email inbox or Slack.

(01:26:16):
So just have a conversation about that. Take a couple apps off your phone. You don't have to buy the book or become totally bought into the system to do those things, but that's what we really want. We just want you to have more time for what matters for you.

Lenny (01:26:30):
Amazing. So I've used up basically all our time talking about Make Time. I think we should have a follow-up episode just to talk about Sprint. What I think we do is let's cut off the lightning round and whatever stuff you guys would've shared there, we'll include in the show notes. I'll send you those questions asynchronously, but let's just talk about Sprint for a few minutes just to give people a sense of what is this framework, it's extremely popular, lets a lot of really successful products, and then we'll wrap up and point people in the direction that you recommend.

Jake Knapp (01:26:59):
Cool.

Lenny (01:27:00):
What is this framework of Sprint? When do people use this idea, this framework, this approach? And what are some examples of what has come out of somebody applying Sprints?

Jake Knapp (01:27:10):
The big idea with a design Sprint is to go from a zero to a prototype and a test of that prototype in just five days. And it's a recipe, it's a scripted set of activities that we developed over a number of many years. First, started with some projects I was doing at Google and I run some experiments with the way I was working. I was a product designer on Gmail in the 2000's, and I also co-founded Google Meet. And in the sort of week where we really catalyzed what had been a project that was going nowhere, this 20% project of people who were familiar with Google, like a side project was going nowhere for a year and a half. It was really on the rocks. And in one focused week working together, we decided me and these two other folks we're going to clear everything off.

(01:27:59):
I visited them in the Stockholm office where they were. We created a working prototype. Instead of trying to come up with the perfect plan, the perfect PRD, the perfect pitch to executives we're like, "Let's just build a prototype and put it in front of our colleagues and get them using it." And we did that and that was the thing that stuck. And so from there on, I was like, "I need to recreate these kinds of moments for teams because that's powerful." So we ran hundreds of these at Google Ventures with startups, tweaked and refined the process, wrote this book called Sprint.

(01:28:28):
We run a venture fund today, John and I and our colleague Eli, called Character. We help teams find and expand product market fit with Sprint. It's a tool for doing that and it uses a lot of these principles we talked about with Make Time to change the defaults, but not just the defaults of the way an individual works, but the ways teams work, the way people make decisions, the way we evaluate what's a good idea, a good strategy and worth pursuing based not on just a hunch or a guest, but based on something we can actually see with customer reactions. So all of that kind of in a nutshell is what Sprint does.

John Zeratsky (01:29:07):
This idea of getting unstuck and turning maybe some abstract ideas or some concepts that you've been discussing, turning that into a concrete prototype, something that you can look at and you can click around and you can actually try. It works in a lot of different contexts, and we've heard amazing stories from people who read the book and have run Sprints at companies that have a hundred thousand people and governments and all sorts of different organizations, but the stories that are in Sprint are about working with startups.

(01:29:45):
We think this is especially valuable for startups because typically you've raised a certain amount of money which buys you a certain amount of runway. You have a certain amount of time to prove that you have product market fit to prove that the thing that you're making is the right thing for some customers. And so the faster you can do that, the more quickly you can find out if you're on the right track, the more quickly you can learn and you can course correct and ultimately you can get to a better place faster than if you spent months working on that prototype or that first version of the product before releasing it.

Lenny (01:30:22):
I think what's awesome about it is as a product manager, the idea of containing a new idea experiment to five days versus this ongoing teams distracted on this idea just like, "Cool, we're going to spend a week, see where this goes. They're not going to spend months exploring. We're not going to talk about it. And just in theory, let's just try it." I think it's really powerful. And so for folks that may want to explore this until we do a follow-up episode, is it just by the book, is there anything else you could point them to think about this idea and implementing it?

Jake Knapp (01:30:49):
Yeah. Well, if you are thinking about, or in the very early stages of starting a company, a great thing to do is to get in touch with us at character.vc. And actually we're just opening up applications to our labs program. So character.VC/labs. Our labs program is an intensive program for startups, and we will run a sequence of Sprints including some new formats that are not in the book, but are excellent.

(01:31:20):
This will be our third time running through this. We found that it's especially valuable for AI startups. So it just turns out that a lot of the complex issues you have to figure out with turning something that may not initially be trustworthy may require a big behavior shift to customers who aren't used to working in this way and sometimes artificial intelligence can produce things that feel kind of alien to people.

(01:31:45):
And so making this stuff actually useful, more than just a chatbot with little stars that's in the corner that says, "Hey, would you like to ask the AI a question about this?" But something that's really meaningful, doing this kind of repeated and we'd run a sequence of Sprints doing it again and again, you work with directly with John and I, we find a really powerful way to get started.

(01:32:04):
Anyway, that's a big advertisement for Character Labs. But yeah, in general, check out the book. Also, would say if you're not quite ready to dip your toe in the whole book, you can go to the sprintbook.com. And we have a ton of resources on there, including a new thing, which is a Miro board, a Miro template that I created that has step-by-step instructions for every single step as well as 30+ videos of me explaining each step and actually I think I'm wearing the same sweatshirt in those, so if you're watching this on YouTube, you can see more of me in this sweatshirt in that template. And that's free, that's free and there's a bunch of resources on the website that are free as well. So anybody, everybody should be able to access this stuff.

Lenny (01:32:51):
Stuff. Amazing. And again, for folks that may want to check out the Labs cohort, is there anything other than AI-oriented that would be ideal? Just how early stage, any other markets that are ideal for the Sprint process and the way you're approaching it?

John Zeratsky (01:33:05):
Yeah, it's a four-week Sprint program for pre-seed software startups. So we only invest in software startups at Character, and this program is really ideal for companies who they know what they're doing. They're not just like, "Oh, I want to start a company." They have an idea of an opportunity that exists, a market that they're focused on, but they definitely haven't reached product market fit.

(01:33:31):
They may not even have a product to test that hypothesis with. So it's very early stage, and we are pretty flexible on the sector, the industry that you're in. But what we find is that the more there's kind of a big behavioral risk, the better this stuff works. So if you're just trying to make a slightly better version of something that already exists, and maybe it's going to be a little cheaper or a little faster, a little easier to use, you probably don't need this stuff. You can probably just do it and probably going to work.

(01:34:06):
But if you are like one of our portfolio companies, they make AI that controls the industrial facilities. They came from Google DeepMind and they did this for Google data centers before, something like that where you have to convince plant operators who are wearing hard hats and dealing with huge equipment, you have to convince them to trust AI. That's a big behavior shift. That's a big behavioral risk. Or in healthcare, in education, places where it feels like the technology can really make a big difference for people, but it can be hard to get over that hurdle of trust and understanding. Those are the types of opportunities that we think we can really help with.

Lenny (01:34:50):
Playing on hard mode, these sounds extremely difficult. I love it.

John Zeratsky (01:34:53):
Yeah.

## Transcript

Jake Knapp (00:00:00):
We would have a conversation with founders, you're saying like, "Gosh, I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question, but who exactly is your target customer?" And three co-founders have three different answers.

John Zeratsky (00:00:09):
After these hundreds of teams that we've worked with, we've seen that there's one failure mode, which is they don't know what that set of basics are. Then there's this other failure mode where they never test it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):
Let's talk about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?

Jake Knapp (00:00:23):
The very beginning of your project, we recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your calendar. So the core team come together for 10 hours roughly and go through a sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):
I think a lot of people wonder as they're hearing this is why don't I just build something and launch it and learn?

John Zeratsky (00:00:42):
One phenomenon we've seen when teams are building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI-generated or assisted they are, the more generic they tend to turn out. Put yourself in a situation where you can slow down and do some hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique. Going fast can actually slow you down in the long run.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):
Today my guests are Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. The framework that Jake and John share in this conversation is basically the missing manual for founders and product teams trying to refine and test their startup or product idea. It's called the Foundation Sprint, and it emerged out of the famous Design Sprint, which Jake and JZ co-created, and also from working with over 300 teams, building both new product at startups and also with teams at larger companies like Google, Microsoft, YouTube, Slack, Uber, and many more.

(00:01:28):
They published a book with this framework at the beginning of this year called Click, and the excerpt from that book that dives into this framework is one of my most popular posts of all time and is one of the rare non-AI posts amongst the top post rankings.

(00:01:40):
In this conversation, make sure to get your pencils out because we go through exactly how to execute this two-day sprint, where at the end of it you have a very clear hypothesis that your entire team is aligned around that clarifies what you're building, who you're building for, how it differentiates from competitors, and how to quickly test it with real potential customers. The two days that you invest in a sprint might be the highest ROI days in the history of your product, and I highly encourage you to do this if you're in the process of baking an idea.

This episode is brought to you by Brex, the financial stack used by one in every three US venture-backed startups. Brex knows that nearly 40% of startups fail because they run out of cash, so they built a banking experience that focuses on helping founders get more from every dollar. It's a stark difference from traditional banking options that leave a startup's cash sitting idle while chipping away at it with fees. To help founders protect cash and extend runway, Brex combined the best things about checking, Treasury, and FDIC insurance in one powerhouse account. You can send and receive money worldwide at lightning speed, you can get 20x the standard FDIC protection through program banks, and you can earn industry-leading yield from your first dollar while still being able to access your funds anytime.

Many of you're building AI products, which is why I am very excited to chat with Brandon Foo, founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey, Brandon.

Brandon Foo (00:03:33):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:35):
So integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?

Brandon Foo (00:03:40):
Integrations are mission critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customers business data, such as Google Drive files, Slack messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):
So where does Paragon fit into all of this?

Brandon Foo (00:04:01):
Well, these integrations are a pain to build, and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:15):
And I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.

Brandon Foo (00:04:20):
Exactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21, and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:33):
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/lenny.

(00:04:41):
Jake and JZ, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

John Zeratsky (00:04:49):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having us.

Jake Knapp (00:04:51):
Yeah, thanks so much for having us on again. This is always a treat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
This is going to be a very tactical conversation. We're going to be going through how to actually execute a Foundation Sprint. And the reason that I'm excited to do this is you guys shared an excerpt from your book where you initially shared this whole concept. It's called Click. You shared this in my newsletter and I was just looking at it, and that excerpt, that post is amongst the top 10 most popular posts of all time in my newsletter, which is especially special because it's not an AI-oriented, it's one of the few non-AI posts that are near the top 10, which just tells me how valuable this is to people. And consistently it has sat there, it hasn't been usurped, it just continues to climb.

(00:05:33):
So I'm really excited to just have a conversation where we share actually how to do this. Let me just start with the beginning, just a little backstory on how the Foundation Sprint came to be. I know it emerged out of the now very famous Design Sprint, which you guys also developed. So just give us a very brief overview of just how this came to be, this idea of this Foundation Sprint.

Jake Knapp (00:05:54):
Well, maybe I'll start by talking about the Design Sprint part because it is essential to understanding the Foundation Sprint. And the Design Sprint first developed, I had been working at the beginning of my career at Microsoft for a few years. Went to Google, which is like 2007, 2008, 2009, and was working on the Gmail team, was working on some projects that were just executing well, delivering, shipping. But I had this other project, a side project that had been going on for three years with a couple of colleagues, was going nowhere, and it looked like their office was going to get shut down after the financial crisis. They were in Stockholm.

(00:06:33):
I went there for a week. We cleared our calendars for the week, and we created a prototype of this, this thing because we decided, look, we're never going to get anywhere. We've tried making the perfect pitch. We've tried to make the ideal PRD, we've tried to show the ideal design, and we can't. Perfection is not working. We're not able to align people, we're not able to get executive support for this thing. We couldn't convince Larry and Sergey and Eric that they should fund this thing.

(00:07:03):
In that week in Stockholm, we created a prototype instead. We decided you know what? Forget it. We're just going to build something and put it in people's hands, put it in our fellow Googlers hands. And that prototype was what became Google Meet. It was this video conferencing tool that you could use in the web browser.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):
No big deal.

Jake Knapp (00:07:22):
Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, the outcome of that, that's definitely probably the most productive week I've ever had. But the thing that struck me at the time and in hindsight was, wow, it was so different to clear the calendar for a week and have the entire focal point of every person on the team be how do we create a prototype that's so real, that works so well that people will think it's real, that they'll react like it's real, that they'll want it? And we were in survival mode. We were trying to keep that office from getting shut down. But the notion that maybe you could repeat that and recreate that is what led me to create the Design Sprint.

(00:07:59):
So for a couple of years at Google, I start running these one-week programs with teams trying to go at the beginning of a project from zero to a prototype at the end that we can sort of evaluate, test. And then I went to go work at Google Ventures. So separate, one of the Alphabet companies we're investing in startups. I meet John Zeratsky and we start running these design sprints with, well, it turned out to be over the course of five years, I don't know, couple hundred teams working in the early days with founders, in the early days of their establishing the product for the first time, trying to build it from zero to one or launching a new marketing campaign, a new ad campaign, some big high-risk endeavor. We'd get to work alongside them for a week.

(00:08:46):
And we ended up refining this process into a recipe. So across five days, it's map, sketch, decide, prototype, and test, one big focal point for each day. So at the end of the week, you've got a tested prototype and you learn are we on the right track or not? And that's the Design Sprint. That's kind of the prologue, the backstory to this thing.

(00:09:11):
And then after a few years at Google Ventures, John and I left and eventually together with our co-founder, Eli Blee-Goldman, we started our own venture firm, Character Capital. And that's kind where the story of the Foundation Sprint comes in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):
Okay, awesome. JZ, anything you wanted to add?

John Zeratsky (00:09:29):
One of our goals, probably our biggest goal for starting our own VC firm was that we wanted to be able to focus on just the kinds of companies and the stage of company-building that was the most fun to us, but also was where we thought we could have the biggest impact. And so for us, with our background as designers, that is the early days, the first couple of months or the first year or two years of building a new business. And at GV, sometimes we did that, but sometimes we were working with companies that were already well established. And when we'd come into those companies, they kind of knew what they were doing. They knew what they stood for. They knew how they were different in the market and how they were positioned. And so we could help them answer these big questions and solve these problems and test their prototypes with customers.

(00:10:15):
But when we started investing in truly pre-seed, sometimes inception stage, pre-product, pre-revenue, pre-everything companies, there was this piece missing at the beginning of that process. So we'd run design sprints and they would be helpful, but oftentimes it felt like there was a foundational element of that project that we didn't quite have our hands around. And it was things like, what is the problem you're solving and who's the ideal customer? How are you different than what's in the market today? Who are your actual competitors?

(00:10:49):
And there were these questions that just kept coming up again and again that led us to say, "Hey, we need to create a new sprint method, something that is really targeted for the very beginning of these big new projects." And so that was what led us to create the Foundation Sprint at Character Capital in 2021, 2022.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:08):
Okay. Yeah, I was wondering the timeline on this. What I love about stuff like this, episodes like this is you guys have done so much work and done this so many times with so many companies, so many founders, and have learned what works and doesn't work. You said hundreds of founders, hundreds of startups.

John Zeratsky (00:11:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:24):
And you've just spent so many hours studying this, refining it, crafting it, and now you're just here to share all the answers, save us so much time. Just the ROI on this is incredible for us. So I appreciate you guys doing this. Let's get into it. Let's talk about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?

Jake Knapp (00:11:42):
So specifically what we talk about with the Foundation Sprint is it's at the very beginning of your project. We recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your schedule, you clear your calendar. So the core team, this is the co-founders if it's a startup, if it's a product team inside a larger organization, it's whoever's in charge of product, it's whoever's in charge of engineering, it's whoever's in charge of design, it whoever's in charge of marketing, the core leadership team, they're going to come together for, it's going to be 10 hours roughly, give or take. And during those 10 hours, we're going to go through a sequence of activities, very highly scripted sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together and identify the basics of the project, what's going to differentiate us in the marketplace, and what's the best approach or implementation path. All of those together form a hypothesis.

(00:12:36):
And then we recommend, so you finish now, that's your Foundation Sprint, you've got your founding hypothesis. Once you've got that founding hypothesis, then you're going to go and do design sprints, and we recommend you clear the calendar for two to three weeks at least, so you have the chance to be wrong about your hypothesis. And we're going to run experiments. And again, the Design Sprint, highly scripted, calendar clear, emails off, Slack is off. We're just focused on running through these sequence of decisions, building prototypes, getting them in front of customers, learning about a scorecard that relates back to the founding hypothesis.

(00:13:09):
So at the big picture, it's going to be anywhere from 10 hours to three to four weeks. You're going to run this detailed script of activities with your team with their calendars clear. And that's crazy, and most people won't do it. But if you do it, it confers upon you a huge advantage because now you've got information, you know whether or not your product clicks with customers. And we've seen that be just such a tremendous signal for is there going to be product market fit?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:38):
Okay. That was really helpful. The 10 hours is that specifically, that's the Foundation Sprint time box?

Jake Knapp (00:13:43):
That's the Foundation Sprint time box, yeah. And it's give or take, right? You might go fast and be done in eight. And you might have a lot of conversations and have a slightly larger team and might take you 12. So we like to spread it out over two days, do two four to six-hour blocks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
Okay. And then the three to four week-ish, that's including the Design Sprint?

Jake Knapp (00:14:00):
That's the design sprints, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, awesome.

Jake Knapp (00:14:02):
One week per sprint.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:03):
Okay. This is incredible ROI on 10 hours of work. Basically over two days, you get to have a much stronger sense of whether your idea is any good. Yeah. Is that a simple way to describe it? You just supercharge validating an idea?

Jake Knapp (00:14:19):
Exactly. Yeah, it's a chance to... In the 10 hours, it's a chance to get clarity about the core of your strategy, which is something that teams will often go months without really nailing down. And the three to four weeks, that's a chance to run experiments and get confidence you're actually building the right thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:41):
Okay, let's talk about these two days. How do you lay it out? How do you approach it? What should someone do if they want to actually try this at home?

Jake Knapp (00:14:48):
So there are three phases to the Foundation Sprint. First phase is the basics, second phase is differentiation, and the third phase is the approach to the project. So again, all three of those are going to come together to create the founding hypothesis.

(00:15:04):
So the first phase, the basics, as I mentioned, that's identifying who's your customer, what problem are you solving for the customer? What's the competition for solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How else do people solve this? What are the workarounds? Those are really almost embarrassingly simple things to answer. But when we do this with a team and everybody's answering, proposing their answer to each question, we see everybody's got a different perspective. And then when we lock in, the decision-maker on the team says, "Okay, it's going to be this one, it's going to be this one, it's going to be this one." Now we have clarity and confidence that that's the right way to go.

(00:15:42):
So we'll move forward from the basics into differentiation and identify what are the things that can set us apart from those competitors? And we're going to use the advantages we have. We're going to use our insight, we're going to use our motivation, we're going to use our special capabilities. These are things, again, people are aware of these things, they're in tune to it, but we want to get super, super specific, and we'll go into an example in a second, and I think that'll make it more clear exactly what we mean. But going then from differentiation to saying, "What are all of the different implementation paths we could take here? Let's identify what those are, put a little detail behind them." And then we have a structured path for people to take so they can weigh that decision, but move through really quickly. Commit to one, have a backup plan in case you end up feeling like you need to pivot once you start sprinting on it. And all of that together is going to form this kind of Mad Libs sentence.

(00:16:35):
If we solve this problem for this customer with this approach, we think they're going to choose it over the competitors because of differentiator one and differentiator two. And it's almost silly how simple this thing is, but really powerful for founders to have that clarity about, okay, here it all is in one sentence. Now let's go test and make sure this is true.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:59):
Amazing. Let's look at an example. That's a really good idea. I know you brought some examples. You're going to do some screen sharing. You're going to pull it up. If you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Also, if you're watching on Spotify, you can see the video. If you're on Apple [inaudible 00:17:11]. But do your best to describe what we're going to be looking at.

Jake Knapp (00:17:15):
Yeah, so we're going to talk about this company called Latchet first. This is the first company we'll talk about. And Latchet is a startup who was in our last group of Character Labs, and we can go into Character Labs later on. But essentially this is kind of an accelerator-like program that we run at Character Capital where we invest in a group of companies at the same time, and we run them through that process that we were just describing, where we start with a Foundation Sprint, and then it's going to be a sequence of three design sprints after that so that they're testing and refining that hypothesis. And so it's a great time for them. These are founders who have just started their companies. They're kind of that pre-seed, very beginning, zero stage. And the progress you can see in those three and a half, four weeks, it's phenomenal.

(00:18:06):
So let's talk about Latchet. So Latchet, a couple co-founders, Chris and James, who they had left Substack. They were engineers leading up the growth team at Substack. And they wanted to build a product for artisans. So if you imagine you're a jewelry maker, you're a painter, you're a woodworker, and you want to sell your products outside of your immediate community, the physical place where you are, your physical location, well, you can build a site on Shopify, but you still have to market it. If you do that, you got to figure out how to reach those folks. You can put your products on Etsy, but Etsy has become quite commoditized. So you're going to be up against everybody everywhere, and it's going to be very hard for you to build an identity there, to build a sense of who I am, what I'm all about. And so what Chris and James thought was maybe we could use some of the techniques and methods we used at Substack to help people find other newsletter writers through their community, through recommendations they make and help out artisans in that way. Wouldn't that be cool? So they were at that stage, they had a few different ideas about what form that might take, what that might look like when they joined Character Labs. And so that's kind of the backdrop to this little quick story I'll tell.

John Zeratsky (00:19:30):
And there's one really important thing to emphasize about Chris and James that Jake mentioned briefly, but I think is worth repeating, which is that they're engineers, they are builders. Their instinct is to write code, it's to build software. And they actually told us that they were excited but nervous to come into Character Labs where we would be encouraging them not to write code right away, to take this time to clarify the differentiation, the structure of what they're building, and to validate that with customers before they went all in on building a particular approach. And I think you'll see in this example how while they were a little hesitant to do that upfront, eventually they saw how much more valuable it was to work in this way versus just diving right into building something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):
That's actually really helpful context. And speaking of the Substack, Recommendations feature was one of the most game-changing features for me with my newsletter because it basically supercharged my growth. So I get why they'd be so excited about bringing this learning to other ideas and to their own startups. So thank you guys for doing that. And I'm even more excited to see what they're building.

Jake Knapp (00:20:41):
Well, let's take a look. So this board here that we're looking at, this is like their Miro board. So we've got a big template. And whether you're watching on YouTube or listening to this episode, we'll talk about at the end how you can get access to this template, which will kind of guide you through the process.

(00:20:58):
But what happens in this first step in the Foundation Sprint, in the basics, as we said before, is that we're going through a sequence of questions. Who's the most important customer, for example, is the first question, the very first question that a team needs to answer. And as we do that, just as an important side note, we're using this tactic that we call work alone together. And specifically the note and vote is this method where everyone's in silence, in this case both Chris and James, but if you have a team of seven, it's all seven people be working in silence, writing down their own answers to this question, who's the most important customer or who are all the different kind of customers we might consider? Writing down multiple answers.

(00:21:38):
And then once we've got those answers, the team's going to vote on those. And then one person who's designated as the decider, usually it's going to be the CEO of the startup, but it could be in some cases, maybe it's the chief product officer, whatever, however they decide to do it. But one person's going to say, "Okay, this is our decision for now, and now we're going to move on." And by doing this and using silence and using structure and then having a designated decision-making process, we can move through a lot of conversations very quickly and save some of that energy that it requires to make the decisions that matter most. In this case, what we're really worried about on day one of our Foundation Sprint is differentiation. So we don't want to spend too long on the basics.

(00:22:21):
Anyway, we motor through customer problem, the capability, the insight, the motivation that the team has, those are all advantages, and who are the competition. And we get this sort of one-page sheet, the basics, and it's going to have the answers to all those questions. Who's our customer? In this case, artisans who want to sell online, but they sort of find tech and marketing to be hard. The problem is sales growth. If we jump down to the competition, their number one competitor is Shopify, but Etsy is another way people approach this, as we mentioned. But there's also in-person sales and art fairs or other ways that people try to get at this problem. And realistically, if you're delivering a solution, you need to stand out from all of those.

(00:23:05):
And then there are advantages. We talked about this key one, they built Substack's network growth features, so they know how to do this thing. So now we've established the basics. We're going to move on to differentiation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:18):
Before you do that actually, let me ask you a question here. Because I think people seeing this could think, "Oh, this is like... I know all this stuff, it's so obvious." It's like, "Okay, I get it. I have an idea, I don't need to do this." Where do you find people most are often surprised by something that emerges out of this? Is one of these buckets often, wow, this is often not what you expected, or is it generally a lot of surprises? What do you experience there?

Jake Knapp (00:23:41):
I think the moment where you immediately start to see value is when everyone on the team is writing down their answers to these questions. And then people put their heads up and look at what everyone else has written and they realize, "Oh, that's not what I said," or "I didn't think of that one." Or, "Gosh."

(00:24:02):
The actual concrete reality of going through with the team and being very transparent and clear about how we're making decisions too about each of these things, when that basic sheet comes together and you see the specifics, the specifics are surprising, but it's also familiar. We look at it and you say, "Yeah, that all looks right, but I'm surprised by the specifics. They're not what I would have written if I had written it down. I might've gotten two of those things, two of the six items on there." And I think that's what's most surprising. And I think it's also kind of a sense of relief that, okay, well, that's very reassuring that we have clarity about that and we've made it concrete.

John Zeratsky (00:24:44):
These activities that we do during the basics are impactful for different reasons. I think that problem can be really interesting because when teams sit down and think about it, it is often less clear than they thought what the actual problem is. Like, "Wait, what problem do our customers really have that we're solving for them?"

(00:25:06):
I think competition can be sort of an aha moment when they start to think beyond just what are the other startups in this space? If this is an important problem, your customer's probably already solving it somehow. It may be a workaround, it may be an alternative, it may not be a direct competitor, but if it's worth solving, they probably have some way of dealing with it today. And what is that? And when you zoom out and you look at that set of competitors, it can be a little scary, but it is also an important moment for teams.

(00:25:37):
And then I think that advantage isn't necessarily immediately beneficial, but it becomes really valuable when the teams are looking at differentiation, because startups can't compete with big companies on scale or on having built-in distribution advantages or having partnerships in place. So they really have to dig deep and figure out what can we do that nobody else is capable of doing? And...

John Zeratsky (00:26:00):
... and figure out what can we do that nobody else is capable of doing? And so by taking time to sit down and do this almost unnatural act of like, wait, why are we special? And when we're able to encourage teams to really think about that, it sets them up really nicely for the next step, which is differentiation. Ideally, based on those advantages.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:20):
What I'm hearing is a lot of the value here is also just everyone has the answers in their head in some way, but just seeing what everyone else is thinking and then aligning on one is a lot of this value.

John Zeratsky (00:26:33):
Yeah. It's like thinking deeply and quietly about it yourself and then seeing what everybody else comes up with when they are able to also think deeply and quietly about it. Then ideally, if they're working with us in character labs, having somebody who's a bit external to push them and say, try harder, dig deeper. What really makes you special here? How are you really going to beat OpenAI? How are you really going to beat Google at this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):
This whole idea of noting and voting and working in silence. Such a recurring theme on this podcast of not doing brainstorms in large groups with a lot of people. It feels like that's just dead in every way. I just had this naming expert on the podcast who names some of the biggest companies in the world, Pentium, Powerbook, Sonos, Purcell, and that's their approach is they used to do brainstorms. He's like, that doesn't work. And now they just have small teams sitting quietly in a room working together on ideas and then thinking on their own. So that's such an interesting trend and I feel like IDEO just created this whole, we need to brainstorm post-its, and then everyone's like, that's not actually working. Let's stop doing that.

(00:27:36):
The other thing that I feel as you're talking through this, what I'm feeling this is for founders, there's not a manual for starting a company. It feels like this dark art of like, I guess I got to find product market fit. And this idea, it feels like this is almost a manual of everything you need to do to just get the basics of is this even worth doing?

John Zeratsky (00:27:56):
Yeah. And that's why we created it because we still are investing in founders who are... They're incredibly talented and they're smart and they have a background that is going to give them an advantage in building some particular product. But you're right, there's no manual and we were just kind of solving our own problem and we believe in this so much and we see the ROI as being so great that this is the first thing we do when we make an investment.

(00:28:24):
We invest in a company and then we run a foundation sprint with them right away. We run more foundation sprints with startups than we do design sprints at this point. And I don't think we can ever encapsulate every single thing that you need to know or that you need to do to start a company, but this is our best take at what you should do in the early days to set yourself up for success and maximize the chances that you're going to reach product market fit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:52):
Amazing. Okay, let's keep it going. So we've done the basics. What comes next?

Jake Knapp (00:28:55):
Yeah, so we've done the basics and another important thing that we've accomplished while going through the sequence of activities and the basics is to boot up the right context into everyone's head so that we're ready for the main event of this first day, which is differentiation. And I still have very firmly in my mind, I grew up with a Mac plus computer and you'd put in the disk and the drive and you'd have to boot up the app that you wanted to run. That's kind of the way our brains work. We have limited working memory and we've got to have the right stuff in there when we're going to make a big decision, when we're going to think hard about a certain problem or question, it's important to have the right context fresh at hand. So the basics is really the context for thinking about differentiation.

(00:29:43):
And differentiation is the heart of what we're doing in the foundation sprint because it goes without saying perhaps, but we like to say it. When you are making a new product, people want to ignore it. People want to not pay attention to it, and if they do have to pay attention to it, if it gets in their face, they want to not try it because we just are all bombarded by so many things and that's never been more true than it is now.

(00:30:10):
And so we have defenses up to save calories in our brain. We don't want to engage. It's crucial then that a product has a clear promise that it makes, and that promise is radically differentiated from the alternatives and that that promise is strong enough that you'll try it and then that the product delivers on that promise. And so when we talk about differentiation, we're saying, look, we want you to be really clear on your promise, not the promise you're making to investors about this technology and what's special about the technology or what's special about the market opportunity, but what the customer at the center. We've started the basics by talking about the customer and the problem they have and the way they see the world.

(00:30:53):
And we want to talk about what you're going to offer to the customer and how it's going to separate from the alternatives. And so in the end of this next phase of the foundation sprint, we're going to have a two-by-two diagram that's going to look like a business school one-on-one diagram. And in fact, we often refer back to this Steve Jobs iPhone introduction slide where he talks about the iPhone and he makes a joke about it. This is a business school one-on-one diagram, but it's really helpful to start developing your product with this clarity about this is the promise we'll make to customers at the end, and we're going to deliver on that promise because we can test and prove that in design sprints. So anyway, we start off, we talk about differentiators and we talk about classic differentiators, fast to slow, smart to not so smart to borrow from the iPhone slide, easy to use to hard to use, and so on.

(00:31:44):
And we just start off and have the team, okay, let's just score those up against the competition. Put a sticky note on those continuums showing where you think the product could be. And usually you'll do this and maybe you'll start to see there are a couple places where we can stand out on these classics. That's great. These classics are easily understandable by any customer. We're all sort of familiar with these kinds of things. So okay, that's great. Then we get into writing custom differentiators. So we're going to write a bunch of good things on one end, crummy opposite on the other end, and then we're going to score those. And so for the Latchet story, we'll pick up with Chris and James here. They've written, well, we could really differentiate on networked versus siloed. Our approach is networked. If you're using Shopify, you're siloed, or maybe we can differentiate on painless business growth versus labor-intensive business growth.

(00:32:37):
So that might be the specific way we describe the promise of our product. So after evaluating a bunch of these, writing a bunch of these, voting on them quietly, and then the decider's going to say, all right, I don't want to choose a couple of these and we're going to try them out. The teams are going to... If you're running a foundation sprint, you're going to try out a few differentiators. You're going to score against your competitors. You're going to create a scale and you're going to say, okay, let's be honest. Let's be tough. Where do we really think we could stack up against the competitors on this differentiator we've chosen in great detail plotting each company or product one at a time. Okay, so you do that for one differentiator, you do it for another, you do it until you feel like we've got two that are really strong, and then you make that business school one-on-one diagram. And so here's this one for says Lyric, they changed their name to Lachit, so I'm going to edit that real time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:29):
I love this. So just rebrand.

Jake Knapp (00:33:32):
Yeah. So Lachit's up here in the top-right corner and we say, okay, look, this is a good differentiation chart because you've got this quadrant here, this quadrant here, this quadrant here, right? You've got the... So you're in the top-right and you've-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
You've got to be in the top-right, you got to be in the top-right.

Jake Knapp (00:33:48):
You always have to be in the top-right. And if you see those other three quadrants, the top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right, those form an L shape and we call that Loserville. So we want to have a way of looking at the world that puts all of the competitors into Loserville. And then we want to say, okay, if you can deliver on that and if that promise is compelling to customers. So both those things have to be true. Can you deliver on it and do customers care and believe that that matters to them? If both of those things are true, you have a really compelling promise. You have the possibility of a very successful product. So now we've identified that and that becomes a core of our hypothesis. Is that differentiation true? So that's the differentiation step.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):
Before you move on to the next step, is that where you were going next? Just so I could take a-

Jake Knapp (00:34:42):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:43):
Okay. Follow a couple of threads. This is so awesome. There's just so much value here. Also, just this slide at the end here, folks are watching YouTube. This is your deck slide where you show your competitors and how you're better than them all.

Jake Knapp (00:34:57):
And actually I want to jump on that for a second because we've all seen two by two. Hey Graham, right? There's a ton of these. They're all over the place. And if you're anything like me, I just ignored these. I just thought these were pretty much BS up until, well, whenever we started putting these foundations friends three or four years ago. And I think the reason why usually these two by two diagrams feel like this is just consultant baloney. This is just like who... It's because maybe one person makes this chart and they do it quickly because they needed to slide for the slide deck and the audience they're considering, maybe it's investors. And so often these describe technology or they describe the market opportunity, they don't talk about the customer's perspective. And the other thing is that they're not proven. There's no evidence behind the fact that these are true.

(00:35:50):
So if they did happen to be about customer perspective, it's unlikely that the whole team would've weighed in on what those differentiators are, and it's very unlikely that we would've tested and proven that matters and that we can deliver on it. And so if you do all of those things and you do it at the beginning of the project, we think this has the potential, when we've seen it becomes this, well, this guiding light, here's the North Star. We need to deliver on this. This is what we have to create. And that helps you make decisions all the way through your product development cycle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:24):
Just to point people to justification for why differentiation is so important, there's a couple of episodes that I did that I'll point to in the show notes that just give you more context of why you need to differentiate. So I spoke of David Plastic who is this naming expert that we just had on the podcast. His whole thing is when he's coming up with a name for Sonos or Purcell or Windsor, it has to differentiate. And he talks about this in depth. So we'll point to that episode and this is just like if you're not convinced, why are we spending so much time in differentiation? Also, April Dunford who's like, I don't know, the god of positioning. She has differentiation is such a core part of her approach to positioning. And so there's just so much evidence to tell you that differentiation is a really important step and element of successful companies.

Jake Knapp (00:37:13):
One of the things that I've noticed about these topics that the basics we talked about already, differentiation, this notion of you need a foundation for your project. It's a bit more under the radar for people. I think it's a bit harder for people to immediately see like, oh, we need this. We see the people who react the strongest to this and have the strongest immediate affinity to this idea actually being start-up founders, people who are really sophisticated in this challenge. Product managers who are at... We were invited in to speak at open AI and anthropic about this, and we see the product people, they're being like, oh my god, this is really powerful. This is the kind of stuff we need.

(00:37:52):
I think for a lot of folks though, it can sound like this is just elementary, differentiation. Of course we need to differentiate. The problem is that all of this stuff gets backgrounded. It's something we've thought about a bit. We assume we're on the same page, we assume we're going to deliver something, but then business as usual happens, we build a product, we get kind of more interested in the technology and delivering that, and we end up trying to sell it to customers at the end. We end up putting a coat of paint on it with a marketing page or sales deck. We haven't actually built from the beginning the thing that we know is going to matter to people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:28):
One of the most useful steps here that I haven't seen before is just a starting place for how to even start thinking about differentiation. Everyone's always probably thinking price and speed maybe. You guys have a really cool just starting list that you showed here. Anything more you can add here for helping people start to think about ways to differentiate beyond the obvious price and speed. And I don't know, a couple more.

Jake Knapp (00:38:50):
So I'm just going to jump into another startup here just so we can see what this sheet looks like with scores on it. So this is a startup called Mellow. Anyway, the standard classic differentiators where we start, they are fast to slow, smart to not so smart, easy to use to hard to use, free to expensive, focused to one size fits all, simple to complicated and integrated to siloed. And so you could probably argue there's these others that should be included or some of those should be taken off. But what we like about this is that it's a small set. They're easy to understand.

(00:39:31):
We know customers can understand these and they create a great starting place for your team to think about differentiation because you can quickly look at this list and start scoring where you think your product could be on these scales and you know that if you can use one of these, people will understand it. But it also starts to make the team comfortable with this notion of differentiation. And again, we want to make differentiation something that all of the co-founders or core team can participate in. It's not just the job of the person writing the pitch deck. It's not just the job of the marketer or the salesperson, but we're getting everybody's perspective in on it and this is a great warm up activity before we start to write our own custom differentiators.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):
Awesome. And then again, this is just inspiration for coming up with more ways to differentiate. Something that is a common question I think for founders is price as a differentiator. Is there any insight you guys have there? How often do you land on price being a good differentiator with the startups you work with?

John Zeratsky (00:40:33):
I think price is rarely the most important differentiator. Part of what's interesting about going through these classic differentiators, these standard ones first and then jumping into the custom ones is that the classic ones are sort of universal, but it is going to be hard beat the competition on very many of these. It's going to be hard to build a product that's faster than what Google can build or what OpenAI can build. It's going to be harder to be cheaper than those competitors because they just have so many more resources. They can have lost leader products that are underpriced. Where I think pricing has become a really clear advantage for some companies is those that are leveraging AI to solve problems that were previously unsolvable with software. So we have a company that we invested in called BindWell and they use AI to design precision pesticides.

(00:41:31):
And we ran a foundation sprint with them right after investing and five years ago you couldn't design pesticides with AI. It wasn't possible. Even if you had that idea, you wouldn't have been able to build it and now you can. And so for them, one of the big advantages is yeah, these pesticides, they can be a lot cheaper because it doesn't require this massive team of R&D chemists to tinker and experiment with things in the lab to try to create new pesticides. We can design them with AI. So it is more often true in AI companies like that, but it's very difficult to compete on price in general. And we think we find that it is not as durable of an advantage as some of these other things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:18):
That is such a good point because historically price has been don't compete on price for exactly what you said. It's hard to do long term. It's kind right to the bottom, especially if there's incumbents, they can price a lot lower. But with AI, that is a really often and strong differentiator. Now do this thing like cursor basically is competing on. You're saving engineering time and it's worth so much money to you.

John Zeratsky (00:42:42):
At the same time, the output of the AI is probably not going to be quite as good as a human process. So it can be a little bit cheaper for now, but it has to be a lot cheaper. It has to be... I've heard people offer 10X cheaper than the legacy sort of manual approach to solving that problem as the rule of thumb.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:02):
That's awesome. Okay. I'll just quickly reference, there's an episode that will come out before this with Modobon about pricing strategy and there's a lot of discussion actually on this.

John Zeratsky (00:43:10):
Oh, great.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:10):
Especially with how to design your price with customers as you're starting your company. Also, the episode with the founder of Superhuman Rahul, he actually spent, there's a lot of cool context on how he differentiated Superhuman and it was actually very much on speed. His speed actually. Yeah, speed was where he landed. And to your point, it was both... It was the Venn diagram of what you said, can we do this and do people value it? And that's where his research pointed to is people really value this and they were able to achieve it.

John Zeratsky (00:43:38):
One of the things that's really interesting about this example here that we're looking at Mellow is that you can see that they were not the best on all these scales. If teams are through and they're being really realistic about how they stack up against the competition, it's normal and natural to find that you're not going to be the best on all these differentiators. And that is really helpful for creating clarity in your positioning and in your marketing because you're not going to show a feature checklist chart that says you're better at everything than every competitor. But if you can drive home one or two things that your customers really care about and that you can be radically better at, it's going to improve your chances of winning and finding product market fit.

(00:44:22):
And we find that going through this process where you're not just thinking about one differentiator at a time or you're not trying to win on all of them, but you're looking across this scale of options and you're being just really honest about where you stack up can both point you in the right direction in terms of what you will win on, but also can give you the comfort to say, hey, it's okay if we're not better than every single company on every single one of these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):
That's great context. That's going to make people feel a lot better I think. Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources. It's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.

That's Coda.io/Lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, Coda.io/Lenny. Anything else on differentiation before we move on to the third step of designing your approach?

Jake Knapp (00:46:10):
I think it's worth taking a look at what it looks like when you have a bunch of these custom crafted differentiators, what that might look like. Because in the case of Mellow, we've got, I don't know, there must be 25 here. And so they've written purposeful, magical, clear, personal, provides direction, flexible, human creative, beautiful, and on and on. What they're trying to get at and what we want every team to think about here is what is a new version of reality, a new lens that you can offer to your customers on the world. Because a lot of times you're building a new product, you actually have to change the way people think about what's possible and what matters to them. Those classics are often already well-trodden ground where other people have differentiated, they've already thought about it, but these new particular things that are possible with your technology that you know is possible with the customer problem, the things that you believe might matter.

(00:47:09):
It's really interesting to try some very fine-tuned list of sometimes just a slight variation. We slightly change this wording or the way we describe what's great about what we do. And that is the thing we think is really going to stand out. And again, you can see even on this list that they've custom written, when we see where they score it, they're not all the way to the good end of the scale on all of them. When they get honest and look through, they're like, well actually, maybe we can't deliver on this, but this one we really can. And this one we also suspect will matter to customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:43):
Where did Mellow land on the differentiators they picked and where did Latchit Land?

Jake Knapp (00:47:47):
Yeah, let's take a look. For Mellow, they trade out a bunch before they decided here. So they actually scored with the competitors on these scales.

John Zeratsky (00:47:57):
And just for context, Mellow is a tool that allows you to run very simple, very targeted, very useful AI agents for common everyday tasks like summarizing your email or cleaning up your calendar or drafting responses to messages. And one of their insights was that there's been so many AI products that have over-promised about being able to replace all humans and do anything and 10X year productivity, but so few of them have actually delivered on those promises. And so they have this insight that if they can be really focused and really human and really high quality and they can deliver on that promise of making your life better by offloading tedious tasks that that's going to really click with customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:49):
That's a great context. Thank you for adding that.

Jake Knapp (00:48:52):
So Mellow lands on mobile first and works out of the box if there are two differentiators and they're trying to differentiate from Gumloop and OpenAI is sort of a generalized tool and Latchit they're going to differentiate on...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):
We're pulling it up. If folks aren't watching, he's pulling up the mirror board to show us where they landed.

Jake Knapp (00:49:15):
Latchit, they're going to differentiate on helps you grow and cooperative. So when they compare against Etsy, when they compare against Shopify or setting up your table at an art fair, they're going to differentiate on helps you grow and cooperative. And they think none of the competitors does both of those things well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):
That is cool. Thank you for sharing that. And to your point, this is where they think it will work. And then the next step is actually test this in the market, which is where we go from here. So let's move on to the next step in which is the final step of the foundation sprint.

Jake Knapp (00:49:45):
So closing off differentiation is a short step that is just to create some project principles that'll help you make decisions in line with that differentiation. And you were just talking about superhuman and differentiating on speed. And when John and I worked at Google back in the 2000s, there was this list called 10 Things We've Found To Be True. And one of the things on that list was fast is better than slow. And what was interesting is this is a mantra that you would actually hear people using in meetings to help dictate decisions. Well, we're considering this approach to this view or this approach, this approach renders 12 milliseconds faster. That's probably going to be the one we're going to take. It's going to be a really compelling reason for us to not go with just the one that renders faster or the one that gets the user to their benefit with one less click.

(00:50:41):
And this notion that you can have a decision-making guide, we think we've seen it be so useful for us in those contexts. We think, hey, this is an easy moment. You've got your differentiators kind of loaded up in your mind. Let's take a second here and just think, what's a principle? How can we turn that into a principle? So if we take a look at Latchit, they've got help sellers help each other. So if they're trying to make a decision between two approaches, well, which one of these helps sellers help each other or do the thing that makes sellers more money? If we're choosing between two things, let's do the one that helps make them more money. And so then we've kind of moved on. We've got a mini manifesto we call it, which is that differentiation chart and these principles. And the notion is this page, the basics page was just kind of the core simple stuff you need to know about this project. The mini manifesto in one page is your decision-making guide.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):
This is so cool and this looks like it would take a lot of work, but again, this is just a day or two of sitting around working through this framework.

Jake Knapp (00:51:48):
Yeah, you'll get to this in four-ish hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):
By the end of the first day, you'll have a mini manifesto that describes how you win essentially as a company and a startup.

Jake Knapp (00:51:59):
Or how you believe it's going to work. And of course, we're going to test it. Now, the next phase of the foundation is-

Jake Knapp (00:52:00):
Believe it's going to work, and of course we're going to test it. Now the next phase of the foundation Sprint is locking in on the approach we're going to start with. So we'll continue the story of Latch It here, it's easier to use an example than to describe this in the abstract.

(00:52:14):
So coming into Character Labs, Latch It had sort of four approaches in mind, but they weren't sure which one to take. So they might build an app, that's one approach they could take. They might build a sort of newsletter platform. That's something obviously they knew how to do. They might build a Shopify plugin, that's a simple way to kind of piggyback on something people are already doing. Their number one competitor is Shopify. Or they might have to build the full stack. And I think a big question for them was, which of these and how much do we have to build before there's enough value for customers that they're actually going to adopt it and we're actually going to get some traction and get this thing going?

John Zeratsky (00:52:52):
And it's important to call out here that all four of these approaches solve the same problem for the same customer. And they're all likely to differentiate from the competition in the same ways based on the unique advantages that the founders Chris and James bring to this company. So these are not wildly different product ideas or company ideas. These are just different approaches. You have the same destination in mind, but you say, "Hey, which path could we take?" It's like pulling up directions on Google Maps. This one's a little faster, this one uses less fuel, this one avoids tolls. What's the right approach for us to take?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):
And I love the work you did on that first day eliminates a lot of ideas you probably had that you would've probably spent time building and then realizing, "Okay, this doesn't make any sense. It's just like what everyone else has."

Jake Knapp (00:53:38):
Totally, totally, yeah. And we usually see teams starting projects in one of two states. And one state is the state that Latch It finds themselves in where, gosh, there's a few different ways we could do this. How do we decide? We can discuss and discuss and discuss, but that could go on forever. So that's state one. We know there are some options. And state two is we're pretty locked in on one approach already. We think we've got this figured out.

(00:54:07):
In either of those cases, we think it's worth taking, again, about four hours-ish to be really careful to lay out the options. If you think there's only one option to sort of force yourself to think, well, what if this doesn't work? What's another alternative? Or is there another alternative that we have previously considered and dismissed that we should maybe reconsider just to make sure? And end with a situation where you've made a decision clearly about, okay, we've considered alternatives. This is our first choice. And you've also identified this is our backup plan. So that failure doesn't seem quite so scary when we start to run experiments. And we're really able to pivot fast should that happen.

(00:54:52):
So what we're going to do on the second day of the foundation sprint through this sort of third phase, which is the approach. Is to identify those different paths, so for Latch It here, they've got a B, C and D options. We're going to color code those and then we're going to plot them on these charts. So we've got these different lenses. We call this activity magic lenses. And the notion is, if we had a discussion about it, and we could ... as investors, if we could imagine like waving a magic wand and putting the perfect team of advisors in place to counsel the founders on this decision, we would love for them to have a customer expert, somebody who's just brilliant vision for the product and the customer experience. And they're hammering their fist on the table saying, "The customer, the customer, the customer, make the decision that's best for the customer."

(00:55:42):
And so we'll plot those options on these axes of easy to use versus hard to use and perfect solution to the customer problem versus this is just an okay solution to the customer problem. And then similarly, we want an advisor who's going to pound their fist on the table for building something cheap and fast, getting it out into the market, being pragmatic, get it out there as fast as possible. That's the pragmatic lens. We want somebody who's going to advocate for growth. What's the way to reach the most customers? Get it in people's hands as fast as possible, easy to adopt. We want somebody who's going to advocate for money, for the financial health of a business. So what's going to create long-term value for the customers? Where's the biggest audience of these folks? We want to look at differentiation. Which we spent the first half of the Foundation Sprint establishing. Well, we want consider these approaches through that lens, as well.

(00:56:34):
And so what the teams will do is to plot these options on these lenses. They'll almost always create some lenses of their own, some custom lenses that matter to them. They might have one about their conviction. I think there's sort of a humorous one for Mellow where it's like, which founder is like, "F yeah, that's exactly what I want to build." And on the other end of the spectrum it's like, nah, just kind of the sort of heat of excitement that you feel. That might be a really important decision point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):
That feels really important. That feels like that should be one of your ... you call these the magic lenses?

Jake Knapp (00:57:08):
Yeah, yeah. It probably should be. It probably should be [inaudible 00:57:11]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):
Yeah, I feel like ... just like how excited are you to build this? It feels like a really important piece.

Jake Knapp (00:57:14):
Yeah, we saw that one in ... this is our cohort of labs that's going on right now, and I'll bring that one up for context.

John Zeratsky (00:57:22):
If we add it, we can call it the Lenny lens.

Jake Knapp (00:57:24):
The Lenny lens. Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea.

John Zeratsky (00:57:26):
In honor of.

Jake Knapp (00:57:28):
Yeah, so here it is. And you can see that Marie is more likely to swear than Ben apparently. But it's crucial, right? And many founders, they'll have different ... one of the challenges is that for each founder, I think, each set of founders, there's maybe a different way that they phrase what that means. What conviction means to them. And maybe it's as simple as this, I just feel it, I just know. And sometimes it's a little bit more like, well, it's conviction, but it's also, what's the data that we have behind it? And that's what forms my intuition about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):
Awesome. I love that lens. I love that you asterisk out so it's not a little bit [inaudible 00:58:08].

Jake Knapp (00:58:08):
A little bit. A little ... just slightly concealed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):
Slightly.

Jake Knapp (00:58:13):
Yeah, if you zoom in, it's actually not censored.

(00:58:16):
So the cool thing about this lens's thing is at the end, you've done all that, you've plotted it all out. And if you're having a conversation like that, you just have to sort of maintain in memory, what did that person say? What did that other person say? What's that conversation I had a week ago? Whatever. Here it's all laid out and sometimes you zoom out and it's honestly as simple as like, "Oh, hey, look, the blue one is in the top right quadrant of almost every single lens. What is that one? What's going on? That might just be an easy decision."

(00:58:49):
Sometimes you zoom out and you say, "Oh, clearly like nothing wins in every lens." And that's actually really reassuring because then you know there is no perfect decision. There's nothing that checks all of the boxes. And that's going to help us decide. Because now we decide which is the most important lens, which is the most important viewpoint to take. And you can actually move forward in either way, either situation you get in where there's sort of consistency across all the lenses or there's not. You either pick a lens or you just pick the consensus winner.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
I love that this step answers a question that's been the back of my mind that I think a lot of people wonder is they're hearing this is just, why don't I just build something and launch it and learn? And why am I spending all this time sitting in a room? And this to me is a big part of the answer is just spending an hour or two thinking through, here's the ideas we have. How do they compare on ... how do they look on these magical lenses? Which makes so much sense. How do they just filter on what customers will love most, will help us grow the fastest, we'll drive the most money? Things like that. It's such a simple, quick exercise that will save you so much time building and launching and having to spend time learning. That is weeks, days, months of work versus a couple hours. It could save you so much over that time.

Jake Knapp (01:00:10):
And it's also the case that you start building something. It's exciting, you can move fast. It's easier and easier to see progress now with AI tools. And that act of building and starting to create something has a momentum of its own that can be hard to stop. And if you're headed in the wrong direction, you can spend a lot of time building and making progress. But it's just, if it's not progress in the right direction, it's actually hurting you.

(01:00:41):
And that's why we want people to pause and take this. It's really, as you said earlier, the ROI is high. But it feels very unnatural to pause when you're so excited at the beginning and ready to go. To pause and say, "Okay, let's make sure we're taking the right path." But just imagine you're Gandalf, you're Frodo, you're starting off, you're trying to get to Mordor, it's a long trip. You don't want to take the wrong path. You want to take the ... think before you start marching through the swamps or whatever.

John Zeratsky (01:01:14):
One phenomenon we've seen when teams are building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI-generated or assisted they are, the more generic they tend to turn out. Which makes sense if you think about how LLMs were developed, they're all basically pre-trained on the same data. And so in this excitement, in this rush to say, "Wow, look at how fast we can build it." You actually end up with something that is less differentiated than what already exists in the world. And then let's say you launch it, and that takes longer than building sort of a clickable prototype. But you launch it because you're moving so fast.

(01:01:48):
And then you get data from the people who managed to find that thing about what they did with it. But you don't get any data about what they didn't do with it. And you certainly don't get any data about the people who never found it, who never tried it. Maybe they landed on your website and they're like, blah, another generic AI-generated thing, that's not worth my time. And so we think it's really helpful to basically put yourself in a situation where you can slow down a little bit and do some hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique. And then you can switch into this mode of like, okay, great. Now let's go as fast as possible and get that out into customer's hands. But if you don't take this step first, it's actually kind of counterintuitive that going fast can actually slow you down in the long run.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:40):
Yeah, to build on that, I had this guest recently, Bob Baxley.

John Zeratsky (01:02:43):
Yeah, we know Bob.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:45):
Okay. So he has this really interesting insight. He calls it ... I think he calls it the Primal Mark. Essentially his feedback is, wait as long as possible to start any sort of sketch or prototype, because as soon as you start drawing what you're building, now everything you do will be a response to that. And so the more time you can spend before starting to concept out the solution, the more likely you are to land on something that works.

John Zeratsky (01:03:12):
That is super interesting and it is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
Counterintuitive [inaudible 01:03:18].

John Zeratsky (01:03:18):
And I find myself challenged to think about it in the context of the sprints that we run with founders. But I think one way to interpret that in the work that we do is that we used to just run design sprints with every team, that was our hammer and everything looked like a nail. And part of what we found so valuable about doing the Foundation Sprint is that it keeps you away from ideation for just a little bit longer. And it forces you to think about why you're unique and the market that you're going into before you get to that moment of creating something that looks realistic and then maybe being a little bit locked into that approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):
That's such a ... like I love that this emerged out of that. Like you guys were so design sprint oriented, and it's just like, cool, let's just make prototypes, let's design, let's make it real, let's show people. And that's, I think, where a lot of people's minds are at more and more. And maybe as a result, and this is almost like, okay, maybe that wasn't the right approach to start. Maybe it's actually better to think a little bit of what we want to design and build before. And so just the fact that you guys spent so much of your life and time on that. And then realize this is actually potentially even more important to do, it says a lot.

John Zeratsky (01:04:33):
And ideas always get distilled down to one thing that people grab onto and they focus on. And I think with the design sprint, it got distilled down to just build a prototype. Just quit messing around and build something. But the reality is when you run a design sprint, it's five days and you don't build the prototype until the fourth day. So you do a bunch of work to figure out how does our customer learn about this thing? What are the different ideas that we're bringing to what our solution could look like? Which of those are the most likely to work? And only then at the end of the week are you building a prototype.

(01:05:14):
But I do think that as that method has become really widely known, people just think about let's build something. And then once you multiply that times the power of AI, it definitely creates this narrative that the only way to build something new is to just create the product as quickly as possible. And that doesn't really match our experience, that doesn't really fit the pattern of what we've seen working best across the few hundred companies that we've worked with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:44):
I think this validates in some ways the role of a product manager where the PM's job is to help the team figure out what should we be building and are we all aligned on what we're building before we start designing and building? This process is almost like the product requirements document of a company. Which I think a lot of product people listening to this will feel really good about.

Jake Knapp (01:06:09):
Yeah, we see this as a great tool for product people. It's a way to give you a structure for leading your team through those decisions. And a way to give all the folks on a team, including the person who's the product leader. But the person who's the engineering leader, the person who's the marketing leader, sales leader, the design leaders, the exact right opportunity to contribute and participate in forming the strategy. The exact right opportunity as we get into design sprints, following the foundation sprints, to then make it real. And turn that idea, that hypothesis about what might work into hopefully evidence that it does work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:54):
I feel like it's actually more helpful to engineers, like non-product people, because I think a PM my brain would be like, I want to do this intuitively. Whether they do it right or not. I think it's other functions almost they're like, no, let's just jump straight to design, straight to prototyping.

(01:07:11):
Let me ask you ... while we're on this tangent, we're on this wild tangent out of this process, but want to ... this question has been in my mind. Because I recently had a founder on the podcast, Maor, who built this company called Base44. He built it, it sold in six months for $80 million. And this journey of that is he just had a problem he wanted to solve for himself, for his girlfriend, for a scouts program. He built it, people started using it, and he kind of evolved it from there. And obviously he didn't go through a process like this. Thoughts on just like, is it okay to just do that? When should someone think about, "Okay, I should actually set aside time to do a Foundation Sprint." Versus, I'm just motivated to solve a problem for my friends. I'm just going to build it, evolve it, iterate with them, and kind of go from there.

Jake Knapp (01:07:58):
One of the observations from our hundreds of experiences working alongside founders in the early days of their projects and watching them make decisions and watching them try things and succeed or fail, is that there are so many founders who are incredibly bright, incredibly capable. They have great insights about the market, about an opportunity. And yet, their startup does not work out. And there's a problem with selection bias that we hear from the folks who they were brilliant, they checked all those boxes I just described. They saw a great opportunity, they were smart, they executed well, they had courage and conviction, and they did it and it worked out, and it was a tremendous success.

(01:08:51):
And I think that the danger in thinking like, "Well, they didn't follow a process, so I don't need to." And that may be true and maybe you don't need it. But what we believe is you have a better ... this just increases your odds. This is a chance to get more clear on, is this a good opportunity? To get more clear on, will the thing I build click with customers?

(01:09:14):
And if you've already figured out that no, this thing's ... my product has taken off, my product is working. We've actually had founders in labs who they started off character labs and they said, "I started selling this thing and it's already taking off. I want to stop running experiments." And we're like, "Yeah, stop running experiments." You don't need to do this if you've got product market fit, if you've got evidence that this thing is clicking and you have conviction, run with it. But if you're not there, this is a great path to get you going. And if you're not sure if the thing you're going to build is going to turn into that $80 million exit in six months, we believe this is a good chance to improve your odds.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):
People hearing this might feel like, I haven't heard of any company doing this that has become a trillion dollar IPO success. What would make me believe that this is the process I should follow versus just, I'm just going to do what I hear on YC, just build it, launch it, iterate, that kind of thing. What can you share to give people confidence this is the approach to take?

John Zeratsky (01:10:20):
Well, the first thing I'd say is give us some time where we're pretty new to this. We started Character Labs about three years ago. We created the Foundation Sprint about three years ago. But more seriously, when we were creating this method, one of the things that we did was look back across all the projects we've been involved in and the ones that were really successful, and we looked for patterns. And while those teams didn't have the Foundation Sprint, they ended up having really clear differentiation and a really clear view of what made them unique that they were able to build on. And as we ran design sprints with them, we were able to test and validate against that differentiation. So we believe that this is sort of a key to success, even if those teams didn't have access to this exact same methodology.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):
So what I'm hearing is this is essentially like Alpha in starting a company. This is a new process that companies are just starting to use. You guys are working closely with founders, and it's rooted in the success of many, many, many companies that you guys were involved in early on and continue to be involved in.

Jake Knapp (01:11:25):
Yeah, it's based off of this thing we've seen again and again in the most successful projects. When we're inside the room in the early days and we're seeing people make decisions, this is what drives those decisions. It's differentiation. And so if we look back across all of the sprints that we've been a part of over the years, and John and I have been inside lots of these rooms, lots of these conversations.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:51):
And if you're not watching on YouTube, by the way, there's a cool visual that Jake is showing.

Jake Knapp (01:11:55):
Yeah, it spans across Google, Google Ventures, Character Capital, and if you're watching on YouTube, you'll see all these little white circles. And each one sort of represents a company that we've seen inside of during these design sprints. And there are a lot of really great success stories in there. We've had the chance to ... I mentioned the story of Google Meet and being there and figuring out what is it that's going to make this thing stand out? That was what made the project finally start to take off. And to this day is still sort of what animates it. Being inside of the early days of what became Google Photos or Google Trips and some of the early design sprints, and there are a lot of others on here.

(01:12:35):
But honestly, of course, we've also seen inside a lot that it didn't work out. If we looked inside the greatest hits though, the real smash successes, we looked inside all of those. We realized there is a common element, and that common element in all of them is differentiation. That there was clarity around this is what we're trying to prove to customers, this is the promise we're making. And so we've been on those teams, or we've worked alongside those founders who have this clear idea of differentiation. And sometimes they're not right. They run the experiments and they change it. But the thing is, they're keyed into differentiation as being crucial. They're not just thinking about the product and trying to get the right shape of the product or trying to make it usable or whatever. They're really keyed in on differentiation and how do we find the right promise and deliver on that promise and express that promise to customers.

(01:13:28):
So to explain a little bit quickly of what I mean by differentiation and how this has manifested in products we've seen, if you go back to the early days of Gmail in the 2000s, if you had email, you were probably using Hotmail or Yahoo and it worked fine and you didn't have to think about it. And this new product comes along and you're like, "God, I'm not going to want to switch my email address. What a hassle. Who wants to do that? No one." Gmail's promise was, hey, massive storage, great search. And as we were building the product out and marketing and explaining it to people and making decisions inside the project, we had to continue to deliver on great search. Great search, great search, that was key to standing out.

(01:14:10):
You fast forward to 2014, and we're working with this tiny company who's now competing with Gmail, who's now sort of the market leader people are used to using in their teams. And here's this new messaging software called Slack, and they're trying to reach new customers. And gosh, switching to Slack is an even bigger hassle than switching to your email address because everybody on the team has to switch. Well, Slack says, "Hey, if you believe that having fun and boosting teamwork is important, it's going to be clear to you. This is a new way of looking at the world." And when they were making their decisions in their first big ad campaign, their first big marketing campaign, this was what they were trying to convey to customers. So we kind of see that from the inside.

(01:14:53):
Another one, we didn't see this one from the inside, but in one that we're all sort of familiar with is what happened with ChatGPT. It goes from this trusted, I don't have to think about it, I'm going to run a Google search. To, oh, wow. It's a new way of looking at the world. There's zero clicks, just tells you the answer. This thing's great.

(01:15:08):
This is also something that we've seen in some of the early success stories from our own portfolio. So 2019, this company called Reclaim going after calendar management. And most of us manage our own calendars, most of us don't have administrators helping us out with that. And it's free, we're in control. Reclaim's argument was, hey, we can automatically, we can use AI to help you focus and to automatically prioritize your calendar. And that animated enough people to take the plunge and switch and try it out, that they were able to build up an audience of tens of thousands of users, and Dropbox acquired them last year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):
A great answer to my question, you guys well-prepared for those skeptics.

John Zeratsky (01:15:52):
Part of our motivation, our selfish motivation with this Foundation Sprint is that now that we are investing our own money into companies and we're working with all these founders, we want them to have that same clarity on differentiation. We saw how important that was to Gmail and to Slack and to all these other companies. And we want to bring that, we want to give them that same advantage and help them avoid the pitfalls that all the other unsuccessful teams and companies that we've seen have fallen into. So that's kind of what we're trying to do here, is bring the lessons from these really successful teams into any team that reads the book and runs this process.

Jake Knapp (01:16:33):
And the special sauce that John and I bring is that we're obsessed with the sequence of decisions that you make and how you work together with your team to make good decisions quickly. And that specificity about the method is something that we do have a lot of evidence behind it working well because of what's happened with the design sprint and with how many successful teams have run that at those companies who are trillion dollar or whatever kind of giant ... all kinds of teams run design sprints. This is that same methodology around how we work together at high velocity and high quality. And it's just brought to a different part of the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:14):
Excellent answer. Speaking of the method, we went on the world's most epic tangent. I want to bring us back. We haven't finished actually going through the process. I think we're towards the tail end of it. So let's just finish that. What else do you do? So you have this ... I guess, catch us up.

Jake Knapp (01:17:30):
Let's catch up with Latch It. So as a refresher for you who forgot. Latch It are building this tool for artisans, they want to help them sell with the community networking features like you might find on Substack. And they've identified their differentiation, they've identified their approach now using magic lenses. And all of this is going to come together to create a founding hypothesis. So if we help Artisans solve online sales growth with a social sales app, and then they've also got their backup plan.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Or we could-

Jake Knapp (01:18:00):
A social sales app. Then, they've also got their backup plan, or we could build the full stack solution if that doesn't work. We believe they're going to choose it over Shopify and Etsy because our solution is cooperative and easy to use. In this single sentence, we've laid bare their strategy, and now they're going to try to find out does that work?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):
That is so cool. The output of the sprint is the founding hypothesis. I love that the term hypothesis is a part of this because it's not telling you this will work. It's this is the thing you will now test.

Jake Knapp (01:18:34):
Absolutely. Every project has at its core ... Every new product has at its core a hypothesis. There is a founding hypothesis. It's just usually not explicit. It's usually hidden, and different people on the team may have different ideas about what it is.

(01:18:50):
Because it's not explicit, it's very hard to interrogate it and test it and find out if the different variables in it are the right variables.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):
I'm curious what's in that photo to the right as you're showing the YouTube.

Jake Knapp (01:19:02):
Oh, yeah, if you're on YouTube. We did this spread together in person. On Lachit's board, you're going to see that here's where they wrote it out and took a photo of it and dropped it in, and then later filled it out on the Miro board.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
Beautiful. It has their old name there there.

Jake Knapp (01:19:20):
That's right. Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):
Every brand that.

Jake Knapp (01:19:22):
Lyric, which it turns out is not the easiest for SEO. There's a lot of lot of Lyrics out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:27):
There is a lot of Lyrics. I know some Lyrics. Just so I understand, is the next step, the design sprint, and that's where you actually start testing?

Jake Knapp (01:19:34):
Exactly. If we zoom out now we see now they're going to head into a sequence of design sprints running one after another. Each of those design sprints starts with the founding hypothesis.

(01:19:44):
Then, the team is going to say, "Okay, what are the biggest risks that ... That hypothesis not being true? What do we need to assess right now?"

(01:19:52):
Going to make a map of how customers discover the product, what that core experience looks like, and then figure out using that map, where's the key moment for assessing that risk?

(01:20:02):
For them, the biggest risk is do people even ... Will these artisans even want this thing? Are they actually going to want to have a community sharing sales platform? They decide the key moment for us to test that, it's actually on the landing page. They figure we can prototype landing pages that describe the product and learn a lot for our first experiment, just with landing pages.

(01:20:23):
They're going to sketch solutions. This will be familiar to anyone who's heard about design sprints. Each person sketching their own proposal for how that key moment should work. Choose the strongest of those.

(01:20:35):
In this case, they choose ... They're going to actually prototype three things. They test three things head-to-head against each other, fake brands for each one. They look like three different products.

(01:20:46):
Then, this is a really key part. At the end of the design sprint, we've got a scorecard. This is actually a new innovation. This is not in the [inaudible 01:20:54].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):
Oh, shit. Here we go. Hot off the presses, design sprint improvement.

Jake Knapp (01:20:59):
This scorecard is going to break down the founding hypothesis. Hey, as we talk to each customer, was this the right person? Is the right kind of customer for us? Do they have the problem that we think they have? Was this the right approach for them? Did they choose it over the competition?

(01:21:14):
They're going to test these prototypes head-to-head, and also show people like, okay, here's Etsy, here's Shopify. Now, out of all these five options, think about, out loud, about how do you compare these? Do we believe they'd actually choose it? Did the differentiation actually work? Are those differentiators valuable and motivating to them? Does it click?

(01:21:36):
Our new book is called Click. The idea there is you can see when a product clicks with one person, and that's a helpful signal. Now, granted, these interviews are kind of a simulation. It's not like the real world, but they're a helpful signal that we're on track for product market fit. If we see, gosh, this product just seems to be clicking with customer after customer, that's a really strong signal. That's when people start to get the confidence that it's time to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):
That's a really good term, by the way. I feel that's such a good way to describe what it feels like. It doesn't just click with them.

Jake Knapp (01:22:08):
Just kind of clicks. Yeah. If you look across Latchet's first scorecard, there's a ton of red. It's a lot of things that didn't work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:17):
[inaudible 01:22:17].

Jake Knapp (01:22:18):
The conclusion at the end ... In this last column, there's a conclusion, hey, we interviewed ... In this case, they interviewed four customers. Well, it looks like this is the right customer. It looks like they have this problem, but everything else kind of didn't work about the hypothesis. Approach wasn't working, differentiation wasn't working. There's some mini hypotheses about the prototype itself. Just lots of red on here, so they sprint again and-

John Zeratsky (01:22:42):
Just zooming out for a second, this is a team who just started working on this new company. Sometimes it can feel slow. We talked about it feeling slow to go through all these steps, but they're only a week in. They've already built three prototypes, and they've tested those three prototypes with four real customers.

(01:23:01):
They have this super detailed scorecard of here's what's working, here's what's not working. That's after a week. It's interesting how what can feel slow in the hour to hour actually can really speed you up in the weeks and months timescale.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):
That was such good context, because I was feeling that. To your point, most founders do not do this much testing, iterating, learning in the first few weeks of their startup.

John Zeratsky (01:23:26):
Yeah. They might spend a few weeks just talking to customers without showing a prototype, and then they might spend a few months building an MVP, and then they might ... Maybe they're going to spend some more time talking to customers while showing them the MVP. Maybe they'll do manual onboarding, something like that.

(01:23:41):
Yeah, that plays out over months. It fits with what founders tell us. Of course it's a subjective measure, but founders who go through this process with us, they say that they're able to accelerate three to four months of work into the three or four weeks back-to-back sprints that we're doing together in Character Labs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Excellent context. Thanks for throwing that in there.

Jake Knapp (01:24:01):
These conversations with customers are so much more fruitful and pointed when you've got the context of I know exactly what my hypothesis is and you have prototypes to show them.

(01:24:11):
We have a founder in our group of startups and Character Labs at the moment. I'm thinking of Maruthi John who comes from doing sales at Rippling, who had been talking to tons of customers while starting off the ... His company. He said, "I've had 50 conversations over the past month, but I learned so much more from even the first conversation when I had a hypothesis and I had a prototype, or a couple prototypes, to show them. It's like night and day."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:42):
That is a great example. This all makes sense. As you guys describe it, you're actually testing something very concrete that your entire team is aligned behind and actual prototypes, and you've thought about different directions. You're testing something very specific versus just generally testing at your general concept.

Jake Knapp (01:25:03):
As we go into the second design sprint for Latchet, they're making some edits to their founding hypothesis. Now, they're revising a few things, making new sketches, new proposals for what this solution might look like. They've learned a lot in that first sprint, a new prototype. They've got a prototype that has more detail now. They are engineers. They're starting to actually write some code and put some more detail behind the product. It's more robust. Again, they're trying to fix that positioning.

(01:25:36):
Here's their scorecard. If you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Again, there's a lot of red here. At first blush, the scorecard is bleeding, but there are some promising signs. There's like maybe a few little sunbreaks, there's some spots where some of the red has started to flip to yellow.

(01:25:54):
If we look at the conclusion on the far right, they're starting to believe their differentiation is dialed in, and they're starting to believe that this could be the right approach. They may be able to get people to choose it to the competition, even though they haven't done it yet. Those are starting to become yellow lights on the scorecard.

(01:26:12):
Now they'll take what they've learned, and now we're into the third consecutive week of design sprints. Again, they're going to sort of review that founding hypothesis. They're going to sketch. They're recruiting a new slate of customers, as they do each week. A new prototype, again, more code in the prototype. It's becoming more and more robust, more realistic as they're also adjusting the marketing and the positioning at the same time.

(01:26:37):
All of these things kind of go in concert. The product itself and the marketing are sort of one as they're moving along, and this is an extreme example of-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:46):
What? [inaudible 01:26:48]. Everything is green.

Jake Knapp (01:26:49):
Everything's green.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):
[inaudible 01:26:50].

Jake Knapp (01:26:49):
If you can't see it, every single one is green.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:52):
Oh my god.

Jake Knapp (01:26:53):
This is extreme, but it is a pattern that we've seen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:56):
This is real.

Jake Knapp (01:26:56):
Again and again. This is a real example.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:58):
Wow. How do I invest to get us in this round? This is great.

Jake Knapp (01:27:03):
Yes, this is pretty great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
This is great. Nice job.

Jake Knapp (01:27:06):
We see this again and again. I can share a couple of other boards of ones that are in progress. We're also constantly adjusting the template so you can get to see a little bit more how people will edit their founding hypothesis from sprint to sprint.

(01:27:20):
Mellow, who we were talking about, here's their first prototype, and here's their first scorecard. Lots of yellow for them. Maybe they're a little bit more likely to use yellow than red.

(01:27:31):
Then, here's the edits to their founding hypothesis after the first sprint. You can kind of see in red, they're slightly changing the definition of their target customer from the first week, slightly changing the problem that they're solving, slightly changing the approach, slightly changing the competition.

(01:27:49):
They've dialed in, they've gotten more crisp on who are we up against. They've gotten a little bit more crisp, just a tiny tweak, on what ... How do we explain this to people to get them excited about it? What's the differentiation? They sprint again, they prototype again. If we just jump down, and just looking at hypotheses, they learn a bunch. Now there's another slight tweak to that founding hypothesis. Week after week you're learning, but you're also really able to track exactly what is it that we learned and how does that affect our strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:20):
Okay, guys, this was incredible. I think we've covered the entire process. I love that you also covered the design sprint pieces, which isn't part of this book, but is such a core.

(01:28:31):
Clearly these things are very connected and meant to work together. You go from here's the thing we should be building to how to actually test it.

(01:28:39):
Let me ask you before we wrap up, is there anything else that you think is really important for people to know before they start trying this process at home? Is there anything you can point them to actually try this at home?

Jake Knapp (01:28:51):
One thing we didn't talk about, we used an example of a company who's not building an AI-first product. Latchet's building this network community sales platform for artisans.

(01:29:06):
It'd probably be interesting to look at how people use this when they are building a very technical product, when they're vibe coding prototypes. That's a question we're getting all the time. What's the influence on this of the speed with which you can build something?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:19):
That's an awesome idea. Let's definitely do that.

Jake Knapp (01:29:20):
Yeah. Okay. Let's jump in here and take a look at a company again, in our current group of labs teams, Axion Orbital it's called. The founder, [inaudible 01:29:30], is actually running this whole process solo, which is pretty cool too. He's a remarkable guy. We have a couple of solo founders right now who are able to generate ...

(01:29:40):
You can see, just to give a sneak peek, he's generating, when we talk about customers, all these sticky notes himself and making the decisions himself about which is the right one.

(01:29:48):
To ground us in this story, his founding hypothesis is he wants to help geospatial devs solve these sort of complex workflows with a browser-based no-code development environment. We'll take a look just really quickly at what his prototypes look like.

(01:30:05):
In the first week ... I can show you this prototype right here, and it's a marketing page. On this marketing page, there's a link to a video. If I click find out more, I'm going to see this video. This video is going to kind of hear [inaudible 01:30:27] talking over it. It's going to kind of walk through a screen share of a very rudimentary version of what this product might look like.

(01:30:36):
Now, if you're watching on YouTube and you see this prototype, you might think, "Boy, that marketing page and the demo itself, pretty bare bones. Not the most polished-looking. This doesn't look super compelling."

(01:30:50):
He was focusing in that first sprint on the messaging, on finding those people who actually have that role, testing it with them, and he learned a lot. If we sort of go back to his scorecard, we'll see, okay, that was a pretty good one. Actually, a lot of green on his first scorecard, but he also felt like what he tested was pretty incomplete.

(01:31:10):
Now, one thing that's cool here, we saw the big leap with Latchet from one week to another in terms of their learnings and the scorecards. One of the things that's interesting here is to go from [inaudible 01:31:19]'s first prototype here to his second prototype.

(01:31:23):
It's obvious he's been able to just build a ton in the next week. He's using AI-based tools. He's doing a lot of work. He's also just a terrific engineer. Here we've got a much more real-looking marketing page, very detailed.

(01:31:38):
An important thing that he's done here with this is he's built out a lot and created a video of something so that the product, while not fully functional, you can see exactly how it works. If we sort of play this video, he's created this demonstration of what it looks like when you type in a query into the engine and exactly the kinds of results you get. By doing a combination of vibe coding, real coding, all of which is based off of pencil sketches, we can go back and see the sketches he's doing on paper to define this is what I think needs to be in there to make this compelling to deliver on my differentiation, and then he's using a product video so that the entire thing doesn't have to work fully freeform. That's what it can look like when a team is building something that's more AI-centric, when it's a more sophisticated tool, when people are going to be curious about sort of the ins and outs of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:33):
Along those lines, where do you find people are leveraging AI most in helping them through these sprints, through either the foundation sprint or the design sprint? Is it mostly just vibe coding prototypes?

John Zeratsky (01:32:45):
That's definitely the first and biggest use of AI in sprints so far is in making prototypes that look more realistic faster. It's kind of like having an entire prototyping team on standby so that you don't have to just make it yourself and sort of piece things together, but you can have a ton of people ready to jump in, make something look really realistic.

(01:33:12):
It's also really critical we found that while you're outsourcing that prototyping work, you don't outsource the thinking. You don't kind of skip over the part where you think about, "Well, what is the actual copy on the website? How do I actually describe what the product is, how it's differentiated?" It's one of the reasons why doing the foundation sprint first and then doing a design sprint can really help you, because it allows you to spend time working on that harder part of what it means to design and build a product.

(01:33:48):
Then, once you have a clear view of that, then you can use AI tools to go really fast. In this example that Jake is showing of Axion Orbital, people get really clever about which parts of this need to be real, which parts of this can be vibe coded, which parts of this can just be a static Figma mockup.

(01:34:04):
It's all about kind of creating a simulation, something that looks realistic, that you can put in front of real customers to help you answer the key questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:14):
That's a really good point that you're making. Again, it's just a reminder, you'll move faster if you slow down a little bit at the beginning, that because prototyping is so easy now and just things that look ... It's so easy to make something that looks really nice and kind of it's doing what you want, but spending a little time making sure you understand what you're testing and what you want becomes more important.

John Zeratsky (01:34:33):
We had a couple of teams in this current group of Character Labs where they jumped to vibe coding prototypes right away at the very beginning.

(01:34:43):
When you generate something using an LLM, using an AI tool, it looks pretty real. It looks believable. I think there's a temptation to say, "Okay, this is good to go. It looks close enough that I'm just going to show that to customers."

(01:34:58):
Then what they found was, actually, it was super generic. It didn't really describe what the product was. It didn't really describe how it was different because it was generated by a model that is trained on existing products.

(01:35:15):
In that second sprint, that was when they really took a step back and said, "Okay, let's think through this and then shift into prototyping mode." It's definitely helping people speed up, but we also think there's an important lesson here that while you're outsourcing prototyping, don't outsource the thinking as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
I see you pulling something up, Jake, that might be ...

Jake Knapp (01:35:35):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:35):
I imagine you want to show.

Jake Knapp (01:35:37):
Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting to see the sketches that went into [inaudible 01:35:40]'s prototype, the Axion Orbital prototype that we just looked at, because they are super detailed.

(01:35:45):
This is ... Doing this level of thought where you're pausing, you're being really intentional about what does the customer need to know, what needs to happen for them to find a solution to their problem and within the product, that's a way of doing your prompt engineering.

(01:36:04):
If you end up vibe coding this prototype, but you start off with a very clear plan about this is what the thing needs to look like, rather than going immediately into a conversational mode where you're co-designing with the LLM and going back and forth via chat conversation, this is much likelier to yield an opinionated product that makes sense, that's very clearly defined around the problem that you're trying to solve, the tasks that need to happen to solve that problem, and the right messaging, the right wording. It's really crisply aligned with what you know about your customers, what you know about what they care about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):
That's such a good point. Again, just the concept of the primal mark is ringing in my head as you talk about this. Just as soon as you make that prototype, everything from that point is a response to that first idea, versus have I actually thought through what this should be.

(01:36:54):
Guys, we did it. This is incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people think through and actually save a lot of time. Is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with? Maybe a last nugget or something you want to, I don't know, just double down on to leave folks with before we wrap up.

John Zeratsky (01:37:11):
Well, one quick thing is that we've shared a lot of examples in this conversation. We actually have a template, a Miro template, that folks can use if they want to run their own foundation sprint.

(01:37:24):
It's the template that we use when we're working with founders, taking them through these sprints. We do our work in Miro. Even if we're in person with them, we're usually working in Miro, or maybe working on paper and then capturing it in Miro because it's just such a great canvas to work on.

(01:37:39):
We'll make that template available so anybody who's listening or watching can grab that and use it to run their own foundation sprint.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:47):
That's amazing. You answered the question I asked that I forgot to come back to. Can we give people a URL? Put it in the show notes, but is it at your ... Yeah, I guess where can folks find it?

Jake Knapp (01:37:57):
You should find it at character.vc. You can go there and we'll have a page for you to ... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:04):
Amazing. So easy. That is awesome. That's awesome that you guys are doing that. Obviously you could also read the book. That goes through a lot of this process, but I think the template is just like a plug and play. Let's just do this at home.

(01:38:15):
Obviously, if they want to go deeper, they can work with you guys to have you ... It's such a win. They take money. You give them money and you help them figure out what the heck to build. What a deal. That's also character.vc if they want to explore that.

John Zeratsky (01:38:28):
Yeah. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:29):
Amazing. Okay. Is there anything else, Jake, that you wanted to share before we close up?

Jake Knapp (01:38:35):
No, just if you made it this far, hopefully your mind and heart is open to this idea, but we know it's a lot to ask, to clear the calendar and follow these steps. If John and I weren't so convinced that beginnings are essential to getting your best efforts in the hands of people and to achieving the things you want for your customers, we wouldn't be doing this. We wouldn't be going to all the trouble. There are simpler things we could be going after.

(01:39:08):
The kind of cool thing we've found about working in this way, though, we've focused a lot on finding product market fit and building your business, getting started, getting momentum, getting alignment, all these things that tactically are important, that business-wise are important, but another part of it that's a nice side benefit, that actually maybe is the most important thing of all, is how close it brings you to your customers, to the people who you're building for. Because you're interacting with them, you're focusing on them as you plan and you're interacting with them on a weekly basis when you work in this way, and how close it brings teammates together in a very authentic way.

(01:39:46):
We're working together on the most important things. We don't have to navigate the usual social dynamics of conversations where one person has an idea and they're pitching it. We don't have to navigate the constant context switches of the calendar that dominates our days.

(01:40:01):
We're just working on the most important thing. The structure takes care of a lot of the difficulty of the process of what we should do. We just find people come out of it with renewed motivation, renewed energy, and renewed enthusiasm around the fact that they get to work on what actually matters to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:21):
Yeah. It just feels like really fun. Just this part of the process is so fun, and then not having to decide how to approach it, having someone just give you here's a framework to follow.

Jake Knapp (01:40:29):
It's like a yoga class, right? It's like, I don't know how to do yoga, but ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:29):
Just tell me.

Jake Knapp (01:40:32):
Explain to me step by step.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:35):
Yoga for startups.

Jake Knapp (01:40:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:36):
That'll be the title for this episode.

Jake Knapp (01:40:39):
[inaudible 01:40:39].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:39):
Guys, this was awesome. I'm going to skip the lightning round just because we've gone long.

Jake Knapp (01:40:43):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:44):
I guess just where can folks find you online? How can listeners be useful to you?

Jake Knapp (01:40:48):
You can find me on LinkedIn. John [inaudible 01:40:51] find you on LinkedIn, too.

John Zeratsky (01:40:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:54):
[inaudible 01:40:54].

Jake Knapp (01:40:53):
We'd love for people to apply to Character Labs, or if a founder, apply to Character Labs. Get in touch with us, character.vc.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:00):
There we go. All right, guys, thank you so much for being here and for sharing.

John Zeratsky (01:41:04):

# Building better roadmaps | Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)

## Transcript

Janna Bastow (00:00):
The whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level.

Janna Bastow (00:22):
So at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you'd take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody and say, "Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?" And they'd tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you'd throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you'd make a new one. So the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process.

Janna Bastow (00:47):
The value isn't in your roadmap, the value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, "I think we have this problem, then this problem. What do you think?" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody who will listen and just check that you're on the right path.

Lenny (01:11):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing your own products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Janna Bastow. Janna co-founded Mind the Product, which I believe is the largest community of product people anywhere. She's also the inventor of the roadmapping framework, Now, Next, Later, and the founder of ProdPad, which makes it easy for you to do your roadmapping in this new simpler way. In our chat, we talk about public speaking, community building, roadmapping, vision, and going from product manager to founder. With that, I bring you Janna Bastow.

Lenny (01:58):
This episode is brought to you by Formsort the leading low-code form builder for product teams. If you work at a startup, you've probably experienced the pain of building forms. Product managers come up with an idea for a new onboarding flow, and then engineers have to build it and then maintain these flows forever. Even tiny changes to the flow can take weeks to get implemented, slowing down your team's experimentation cycle. Formsort removes the engineering bottleneck and gives product managers and marketers full control over the form building lifecycle. With Formsort, anyone can build highly customizable forms, implement complex logic, and send data to destinations like Postgres, BigQuery, and Segment.

Lenny (02:38):
Companies like GoodRx, Candid, and Balance Homes build their most important forms on Formsort, think patient intake data, surveys, and fintech onboarding. They've seen conversion rates increase by over 30%, and have saved thousands of engineering hours. I always tell startups that improving onboarding is one of the most powerful ways to optimize activation and increase retention. Formsort makes this process as easy as possible and it's why I'm a proud investor. You can sign up for a free account on formsort.com and use promo code Lenny for 20% off a Formsort Pro plan.

Lenny (03:15):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers. And it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.

Lenny (03:42):
Over the years I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life. With an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda doc gallery, including resources from many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda.Some of the best teams out there like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber, use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use. If you're ping ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda. You can take advantage of a special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (04:44):
Janna, welcome to the podcast.

Janna Bastow (04:45):
Hi, thanks so much for having me.

Lenny (04:47):
It's my pleasure. Just to start off and set a little context for folks, could you give listeners a 55 second background on what you've been up to in your career?

Janna Bastow (04:57):
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm a product manager by background. I started my career falling into product management like a lot of people do, accidentally. I worked my way up to be head of product at a startup in London. And then saw the need for product management tools, because there wasn't really anything like that out there. So started building ProdPad. One of my co-founders, who I also happened to start Mind the Product with, and Mind the Product turned into the world's largest community of product managers. So I ended up founding two things at the same time, and that's what kept me busy for the last decade or so.

Lenny (05:28):
And currently you have a company, maybe just mentioned that, before we move on, because I think it'll be important.

Janna Bastow (05:33):
Yep, absolutely. So that tool that I was talking about turned into ProdPad, which is software for product people. So it's a tool that allows you to build roadmaps and do your OKRs and capture ideas from your team and feedback from your customer and just organize all your product managements stuff in one space.

Lenny (05:47):
Awesome. So you mentioned Mind the Product and ProductTank, which is kind of this associated component. I'm not exactly sure the difference, but I know they're related. One's a community component, right? Is that right?

Janna Bastow (05:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (05:57):
Yeah. So I think you mentioned it's probably the biggest product community in the world, both online and offline. And as someone that's building their own community around the newsletter and the podcast that I have, I'm always curious just to learn what folks have learned about building communities, especially for product people. So question on my mind is, what do you think has been most important in getting Mind the Product community right early on, and then also just maintaining the quality of the community?

Janna Bastow (06:23):
Honestly, it wasn't so much that we set out to build a community, it was that we got together with some product people with the idea that we didn't know what we were doing. And so we figured if we got together with some other product people and started chatting it through, we'd all learn together. And so it was just the sense of sharing and collaborating and learning from each other and just keeping it as grassroots as possible as it grew. And consistency as well, just always being there, every month, holding a ProductTank, every year of holding an event. But just being there, whenever there was a chance to be there.

Lenny (06:56):
So I'm hearing is just putting in the time, doing it consistently. I imagine a big part of it was having the right sort of people involved early on that are maybe the right exemplars of the type of community you want to build. Is that roughly right?

Janna Bastow (07:09):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean surround yourself with the people who are going to help you continue that community and are going to help you with that consistency, and going to help you surround you with more and more of the right people. One of the things we learned really early on was that we only had so wide of a network. And so being able to get other people to help us curate and bring in other smart people to help find other speakers outside of our network, and help find people to write on the blog when we'd run out things to rant about. Similar to what you do, Lenny, you've got people from all over your community helping to contribute to the wider picture.

Lenny (07:42):
Awesome. What's the scale of the community at this point?

Janna Bastow (07:45):
That's a good question. I don't have the exact number. What you might not know or what you might know is that Mind the Product was actually sold earlier this year, so I don't have-

Lenny (07:51):
Mm-hmm. I did know that.

Janna Bastow (07:52):
... a handle on the exact numbers now. And it did go influx when COVID hit. I know at one point in time the ProductTank was like 200 going on almost 300 cities around the world. I don't know what that number is today. I know that it sort of went up and then down and then back up again. Some of those are digital still, some of those are back in-person. I know that there's thousands and thousands of product people around the world who are taking part in the community in one way, shape, or form or the other. And, of course, some people take part in the big conferences as well.

Lenny (08:22):
I imagine there were some mistakes that you made along the way building this community.

Janna Bastow (08:26):
Oh God.

Lenny (08:26):
Is there anything that stands out as, "Oh, man, we shouldn't have done that"? For folks that are thinking about building communities these days,

Janna Bastow (08:32):
When running a conference, it's one of the most expensive and unleanest things you can possibly do. It's really difficult as a product person to pull that off, because it pulls at your heart. You want to do something that's lean iterative, but you can't. If something screws up with the lunch order, for example, you can't fix it. You have to wait until the next year and you just have to pull out whatever you can to make it good enough for that particular year. There was a year once when we ordered food and it didn't turn out to be enough, because the caters under delivered, and we ended up having to get all our volunteers to go to the local sandwich shops and buy all the food up and bring it in.It was stuff like that that was difficult at the time, but we made do with what we could and we ended up sending cash cards to our attendee saying, "Here, let's make it up to you." Stuff like that, that just becomes logistically really, really difficult when you're just thinking, "Oh, we just pay a supplier and they make it happen." It's not that simple.

Lenny (09:29):
Got it. Okay. But that's a plus one for me to never run a conference, something I never want to do. And this is a reminder of all the pain that goes into them.

Janna Bastow (09:38):
Conferences are ridiculously hard. I mean the thing that I've learned is when something goes wrong in a conference, it doesn't happen in the hundreds of dollars of cost, it happens in the thousands of dollars of cost. A speaker who decides they can't make it for one reason or the other, totally legitimate reason, sure, but you've already paid for their business class flights, and so you've got to find another speaker last minute and get them over. That's thousands of pounds in the hole. It could be things like the printing went wrong and you found out the day before, that's more dollars gone. There's lots of things that could go wrong. Our venue once went bust, the after party venue once went bust three weeks before the conference. That was year one.

Lenny (10:19):
Super.

Janna Bastow (10:19):
All of these things, yeah, that's what we said, "Super, what are we supposed to do?" We ended up having to just make do and found somewhere else and roll with it. So lots of things that go wrong at that sort of level. But the thing is that we built up a lot of goodwill with the community and were able to get help from people around us, get suggestions from people around us. And when things ended up, actually it turns out we ended up with a smaller venue than we expected, or this was slightly different or whatever else, we had people forgive us. It worked out okay, in our favor.

Lenny (10:49):
Just while on this topic, I'm most curious, are conferences like a good business? Do they make a ton of money in some occasions? Is it always just super thin margin? How does that even business work?

Janna Bastow (10:59):
It's not for the faint hearted. It's hugely risky. In hindsight, I'm highly surprised we actually made it through some of those first ones. If you can do it, there are some amazing ways that you can monetize them. But it only starts making a difference at larger figures, and it takes a lot of efforts to actually get to that point. Somebody once asked me like, "Oh, we're struggling to sell tickets. How do you sell all those tickets?" We'll start a community several years before and invite people and run a thing, some sort of community meetup every month time, time again beforehand, and that's your marketing.

Janna Bastow (11:33):
Just if you undersell tickets to a conference, for example, it can absolutely break it. And you see sometimes conferences, they run one and they don't have enough people turning up and it's gone. That can just break it. It's ridiculous. Something like COVID comes by and it can break it. It's a ridiculously hard business. It's really hard to ensure against. It's really hard to think of all the things that could go wrong and protect against. So while there are some upsides, it's not for the faint hearted.

Lenny (12:01):
Okay, cool. That's another plus one. I have a friend who runs events here in San Francisco and I'm always just like, "How can someone be excited about running events over and over? It's so stressful and full of risk and there's always things going wrong. You can't ever have fun at these things." So it's always a different personality.

Janna Bastow (12:16):
Yeah, event organizer or event manager or something like that was once listed as one of the most stressful jobs out there. And you can see why. It's because it all just lands on you all at once. And once the event is over, there's the sense of [foreign language 00:12:29], as in it's over and now what? The next day you're just like, "Yay." You can look at the tweet stream of everything that happened. You can look back at the photos and then you're like, "What do we do next?"

Lenny (12:38):
Start prepping for ext year.

Janna Bastow (12:39):
You start prepping for next year, off we go again. And it's really hard work. But there again, product management was also listed as one of the toughest jobs, one of the hardest jobs out there. I'm not sure if that still stands, but I know product management as it stood 10 years ago, five, 10 years ago, certainly did have a different vibe to it, and it was a really tough job.

Lenny (12:58):
Continues to be a very tough job. On the topic of conferences and speaking, I've watched a bunch of your talks online before we started chatting today. And a couple things I noticed. One is you're just an awesome speaker, and you're also storyteller. And something that comes up a lot on this podcast is just how important communication skills are to product leaders and product managers and storytelling. And you've also seen a bunch of people do awesome talks at these conferences. So I'm just curious, whatever you have in mind, what has helped you become a better speaker and storyteller? And then also what have you seen is important to folks that are really good at storytelling and presenting at a conference, let's say?

Janna Bastow (13:37):
Right. Yeah, such a good question. I mean, I have learned by watching a lot of other people. One of the things that I have been super lucky in my career is that by being part of Mind the Product I've gotten to watch every last Mind the Product speaker, top end speakers. I've been able to see every ProductTank London speaker, and a lot of the other ProductTank speakers around the world. Been able to see what people react to, what works, what doesn't work. So I've been able to develop a taste for a good talk and a good presentation and that sort of thing.

Janna Bastow (14:06):
But also one of the things that Mind the Product has been able to provide to speakers is a speaker coach. So when I was invited to speak on the Mind the Product stage in 2017, one of the things that they provided to me was an actual speaker coach, somebody to take my talk and improve on it. And it was really nerve-wracking taking my half-written talk, which I started months and months before, it started off with just Post-It Notes scattered along the wall, which I tried to turn into something. And I think it was probably six hours worth of content. And I brought this to this speaker coach, and I had a vague script idea of what I wanted to say.

Janna Bastow (14:43):
And she said to me, one of the first things, she said, "Well, I've taken your script and I've turned it around. I've rewritten the jokes to land a little bit better." I was like, "That's great. I had jokes." And she helped turn the stories around, so that they carried through. She helped with posture. She helped with delivery. She helped with even just phrasing of words. Just making sure that everything landed in particular ways. And one of the things she did was make me listen to it and play it back, which I had not done before. And I still hate doing to this day, but am now more used to it than before.And I don't think anybody likes listening to the sound of their own voice. I don't think anybody likes doing that. But it does help with it. If you've got a large presentation, a big presentation, you've got to get up to that level. If you're nervous about doing it in front of a 1,000 people, then getting to that level that you're actually willing to, able to hear yourself do it, and you're able to do the talk flawlessly in the shower, and as you're walking to work, and as you're doing your groceries and all that sort of stuff, then it makes a big difference.

Lenny (15:47):
So one tactic that I love that you shared is record yourself, watch yourself ,keep refining, but watching your actual performance. Looking back at the lessons your coach taught you for new presentations that you do, is there anything else that sticks with you? Or just let's make sure to get X, Y, Z nailed because that'll help make this talk better.

Janna Bastow (16:06):
One of the things that I've stopped doing is I used to sit down with a PowerPoint and start writing my deck in PowerPoint or Slides, now. What I now do is I start with my story points. I start with my narratives. I try to figure out what I'm actually trying to say, and then I fit it into the deck. Because what I was doing before, I would get stuck in this mode of the presentation mode, and trying to make the presentation, the slides fit my narrative as opposed to the opposite way around. Having a great narrative, and the slides should follow more naturally.

Lenny (16:43):
What about just the presenting, the physical anxiety of presenting?, Is there anything you've done there to get better with that and feel-

Janna Bastow (16:51):
Oh, yes.

Lenny (16:51):
... more comfortable?

Janna Bastow (16:51):
So one of the things that actually really does work is the power pose, standing with your hands on your hips and it really does, I'm not sure if it's adrenaline or endorphins or something, it releases some sort of chemicals that really does just help boost your confidence and make you feel better as you're getting ready to stand on stage. And it something that's me and other Mind the Product speakers, and I've done behind all the big stages that I've done in recent years. Stand there with your hands on your hips and just feel better about it as opposed to sitting there balling up in that tense pile of stress.

Janna Bastow (17:25):
One of the other things that I always do, if I get a chance to, is get out onto the stage sooner rather later. So when they do the tech check, just walk out onto the stage and just wonder back and forth and look out to the audience and greet it. There's no one there. It's the day before, it's completely empty. But look up at the audience and just enjoy that sweep of the audience, and just get used to it. And imagine it full of people. Don't imagine them naked, that doesn't matter. But just imagine them there, so that when you actually do see them the next day, it's not so stressful.

Janna Bastow (17:56):
One of the other things I try to do is find the people in the audience who are your fans. And you'll find them in the course of your talk. There's always going to be some people in the audience who just look bored and they're on your phone, just ignore them. They're always going to be there. Find the people who are nodding along and smiling and going, "Yeah, yeah, that's me. That's me." And just speak to them. And if you find one up there and one over there and one down there, no one's going to notice that you're doing your talk just to them. And just keep delivering your talk around the room to these few key people. They're having a great time, you're having a great time, and you're doing a great talk as a result.

Lenny (18:30):
That's such good advice. The power pose piece, you said that it's hands on hips. I think there's also when we raise your hands up and you're like Superman or something. I think there's-

Janna Bastow (18:38):
That could work, yeah.

Lenny (18:38):
Yeah. I think people have different ones. Also, I've seen that, there's like all the science that showed that was effective and then I think it was one of those experiments that wasn't replicatable. People are kind of worried that there's not real science backing that up. But I've done that myself and it actually works. And so it doesn't matter ,if it works for you, just do it.

Janna Bastow (18:57):
Yeah. If it's a placebo, hey, don't tell me that, it works. Honestly, I feel better at the end of it, and get on stage and do a better job.

Lenny (19:05):
Someone made this point, placebo is this magical thing that we have in our brains that gets things to change by not having anything go. You just change things. It's amazing. It's magical.

Janna Bastow (19:15):
Yeah. Placebos are as effective as the actual drug, whatever. I'm happy with a placebo. Just don't break the placebo effect for me. That would be fine, right?

Lenny (19:23):
Yeah. That's right. One last question on the speaking stuff. How bad were you initially? Just because folks probably see you, see some of your talks and they're like, "Oh, my god, I'm never going to be this good. I'm screwed."

Janna Bastow (19:34):
Yeah, I used to be shaky, little fawn, shaky voice, terrified at the front. Okay. So it was one of the first ever ProductCamp events that we were running. And the first one I think I did okay at, but it was a smaller group, it who's only like 50 or so people. And the second one it had ballooned to 200 people. This is more product people than I'd ever known. And they were all super professional, and they're all looking at me. And I stood at the front of this group and I was supposed to just, I don't know, tell them what they were supposed to be doing that day. And I had it all half written down, and I started talking and then I sort just tripped up over what I was saying and forgot everything and blanked. And I just looked up and I went, "I'm really sorry everybody. I'm just going to start again."

Janna Bastow (20:19):
And I started again. I said, "Hi everybody, I'm Janna and welcome to ProductCamp." And I just started again and they were just totally fine with it. Honestly, it was fine. And this is the thing that I've learned since then is people in the audience are rooting for you. They were totally cool with this. They didn't think anything of it and they just rolled with it, as did I. And so whenever I see somebody who's struggling on stage, just give them a nod, a smile, clap them along, give them reassuring looks, and hopefully they'll just pull through.

Janna Bastow (20:48):
And if you ever feel like you're shaking, you're corpsing on stage, you're falling apart, honestly, just take a deep breath and just pick up where you last remembered you were and just keep going. Honestly, no one is rooting for you to fall over and have a bad time. Everyone's rooting for you to finish your point and get on with it.

Lenny (21:05):
That's such a great story and it's a good example of people have this fear of the worst case scenario. Everything's going to fall apart. They're going to be seen as idiots, they don't know what they're doing. It's all going to be revealed on stage, because you screw up in how you're talking. And the worst case scenario never happens, in my experience. And two,, if it does, just do exactly what you said, just try to start again. It's easy to say, hard to do. This isn't a conscious thing that people can get over. It's like your body's just doing crazy shit and you're so nervous sometimes and can't just rationalize it to like, "Nah, it'll be fine." But, yeah, it's fine. To your point, people want you to be awesome and succeed. They're not there to like, "Ha, ha, you stopped. You screwed up."

Janna Bastow (21:47):
And it's humanizing when you screw up, right? People don't like people who are perfectly perfect and don't mess up, and it makes them feel like they can't go up and go do their talk. I mean I think that right there showed everybody else that they could go up on the little ProductCamp stages that day and go do their own talks. And they certainly wouldn't be any worse than that. As long as I just remembered their name, they'd be fine. Crack on, they got it.

Lenny (22:12):
Speaking of screwing up, you have some very spicy takes on roadmap and roadmaps.

Janna Bastow (22:16):
Ooh, yes, I do.

Lenny (22:20):
And then generally the mistakes people make in organizing the roadmap. So I definitely want to spend some time here. So first of all, you have some strong feelings against Gantt based road mapping. Can you talk about that?

Janna Bastow (22:31):
Yeah, sure. I used to do timeline roadmapping. The first version of ProdPad was actually a timeline roadmap. So to take you back, when I was a junior product manager, mid-level product manager, I used to do my roadmap like everyone else was doing the road, as in I looked up what a roadmap was, and it looked like a colorful Gantt chart. I knew what a Gantt chart was. And so I started putting one together, which is where I'd take the features that I was working on and line them up against their due dates. And I would get a little pat on the head from my boss, and they'd say, "Good job, now go deliver it," basically.

Janna Bastow (23:05):
And I would do my best with delivery, and I'd never quite be able to deliver everything. Something would always get in the way. But I sort of assumed that was my fault. I just wasn't great at delivery, and I just had to get a little bit better at adding enough buffer and setting expectations and doing a roadmap slightly better. But I figured that this is how everyone was doing the roadmaps, and it was just me who wasn't finishing the stuff on the roadmap quite right.

Janna Bastow (23:29):
And when it came to creating the first tools for roadmap, I'd envision something that would actually help me manage this format of a roadmap more easily. Which I ended up creating the very early version of ProdPad, which was a digitized version of this, where you could drag and drop ideas onto the roadmap and stretch and squeeze them, and pan the roadmap back and forth. And I shared this with some early product people that I knew, some early users, and they gave me some feedback and some of them absolutely loved it.

Janna Bastow (23:56):
They're like, "Yeah, this is great. Now I can stop using PowerPoints or whatever tool I'm using or drawing it up in whatever I can now start using this digitized tool." But one of the things that we started hearing from early customers is about a month later they said, "Great, but I want to take this, and move all these things here over by a month in the field." We're like, "Oh, that's interesting. We've heard that from a bunch of other people too. Now why is that?" Because had we just asked our customers, had we just built what our customers wanted, we would've just ended up with a multi-select drag and drop. But this was all built in jQuery and it was a little bit difficult to build that.

Janna Bastow (24:35):
So we sort of asked the five whys, we dug in to why people wanted this thing, and we found out that no one was actually delivering the roadmap in the timeframe that they were saying they were. So we're like, "Wait, if it's not just us who's not living the roadmap and none of these better than us roadmap product managers are building the roadmap on time, what's the point of a roadmap? Why are we giving them a roadmap?" So that's when we sat down, it was myself and Simon, my co-founder at ProdPad, and we sat down and we came up with a three column roadmap, current, near term, future, which became now, next, later.

Janna Bastow (25:08):
And it took away the simple concept of a timeline at the top. Now, the problem with the timeline is that as soon as you have a timeline, it turns it into a math chart sort of thing, where you've got time on the X axis and things to do on the Y axis and you basically end up with everything underneath is assigned a due date or a iteration. And it seems that everything that you do has a due date, an iteration just by the format of the roadmap, which is painful. It's just wrong, because we don't have that. The further out you plan, the more you're making it up. We know this.

Janna Bastow (25:45):
And so we wanted more flexibility and we knew that other product managers wanted that flexibility, because we kept asking what they were up to. So we decided to break it down into these three buckets, and provided that as an option and people loved it. It became this first bump in our usage of ProdPad, because people went, "Oh, wait, I can just say what's happening now, what's happening next, and what's happening later? And if I want to, I can add a date to the specific thing, but I don't have to. And I can be less and less granular about that as I go forwards. Yeah."

Janna Bastow (26:18):
So it's taking from the concept of the cone of uncertainty, taking from the idea that things get less certain as they get further away, which is kind of how reality works. So the whole beef with the timeline roadmap is just taking apart the concept of the timeline. It doesn't mean we live in la la land. It doesn't mean that we don't believe in having dates on the roadmap, if there is a date that we have to work towards. It just means not penalizing ourselves by having a date on everything on the roadmap.

Lenny (26:49):
Got it. Okay. I didn't know that you could put dates on some of the things that's interesting, because I was trying to understand exactly how this approach works. We should also mentioned, you came up with this whole idea of now, next, later, which a lot of people use now. Is that right?

Janna Bastow (27:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (27:02):
Awesome. Okay. So as someone that's been using Gantt timelines his whole career, I'm really curious to dig into these ideas and challenge the default assumption.

Lenny (27:12):
I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (27:17):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (27:18):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation, and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (27:30):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (27:51):
And supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (27:55):
Yeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates, and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growing.

Lenny (28:04):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John. And head to amplitude.com to get started.

Lenny (28:09):
There's two questions that this brings up, and you may have answered them in part. One is just without dates on things, how do you make sure marketing and sales and your CEO has things that they need for promising or at least giving a sense of when a product will come out? And the other is just aligning internally with engineers, design being done on a certain date, engineers being done on a certain date, PMs being done a certain day, [inaudible 00:28:32]. How do you deal with those in this format?

Janna Bastow (28:36):
There's a couple ways that you can turn that around. So one is you should still be having regular communication, so they can still see what's coming up in the now call them. So they have a sense of what the order of things are and that things that are in the now column are probably weeks away, not months and months away. You should probably have launch readiness meetings so people understand this is the stuff that's going through testing, and that's likely to be coming out now.

Janna Bastow (28:59):
But one of the other things that you can be doing for your marketing and sales teams is separating your hard launch from your soft launch. So what you should be doing is basically saying your developers are able to launch something on a particular date and it's the date that's convenient for them, right? Let's say they think that they can get something out for end of September. Now, that might be pushed to made October because things go wrong.

Janna Bastow (29:23):
Now at that point, whether it's end of September or mid-October, it doesn't really matter to the marketers because they're busy talking about the stuff that was launched in August. They've got lots of stuff to work on. They're selling and marketing the stuff that's already live and out there. When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps. Now you've got something else to go do. And it's so much better for marketing anyways because they're not setting up their launch steps based on something that they don't have eyes on. There's nothing worse than the marketers trying to market something based on pictures from the designers that have vastly changed by the time they go out or that they don't know whether it's going to come out on the right day or not.

Janna Bastow (30:07):
So they've actually got a functional working version that they can share with some customers. They can start getting videos of it working. They can get testimonials from early beta users. And then they can spend, whether it's two days or six days or six weeks or six months planning the biggest, bangest launch they want. They can then spend the next however long they want to launch their hard launch, and then that goes out. And in that period that they're doing that hard launch development is cracking on with their next thing.

Janna Bastow (30:41):
And by the time that they're done that marketing is then, "Okay, great, what have you built? We're ready to work on the next thing." So you're just separating soft launch from hard launch, so that you don't have this stress of trying to line up to completely different types of projects, your marketing projects and your development projects, which is where a lot of those things fall apart.

Lenny (31:00):
Got it. So kind of the basic premise is roadmaps or timelines sound great and awesome. Everyone would love to know when things are going to be done and if it worked it'd be great. Oftentimes, they're all made up, they don't work, you don't hit deadlines, they're always missed. So instead of promising dates for everything you're doing, you're better off generally just giving a sense of, "Here's what we're going to work on now. Here's what's coming up next." And then for the things that really need a date, we're going to put dates on those things and give it our best shot. Is that [inaudible 00:31:29]-

Janna Bastow (31:29):
Yeah. That's absolutely right. If something does have to have a date, we don't live in la la land, if something has a regulatory date, when GDPR came down, everyone had a due date on the roadmap, because if you didn't hit that date then you were going to be in trouble. Sometimes you might have dates that are tied to things like the Christmas rush, or if you're in education it might be like has to be out by the school year.

Janna Bastow (31:50):
At which point, in order to reach something by that date you have to put in more project planning work, as in you have to plan out ahead of time, you have to put in more buffer time to do that. And generally you have to plan to get that thing done well before, so that you can have a soft launch before and make sure it works and do some iteration and fix it before the actual full-on launch happens. Because if you leave it too late, it's going to go wrong and you're going to miss the deadline.

Janna Bastow (32:16):
If you did that for all of your launches, you're just going to end up either cutting quality, because everything's just going to be big crap cause it's going to be pushing it out the door last minute. Or you're just going to end up spending so much time trying to plan things to the nth degree that you're just going to move super slow. This is why you end up with teams who are really big but can't deliver worth anything. Where compared to these tiny teams, who are just out delivering them and just spinning things out the door, they're the ones who aren't spending all their time going, "Are we certain this is going to deliver? And how many hours is this going to take you? And let me go talk to this person, find out how many days it's going to take him," and back and forth and back and forth. They're just building, and it goes faster.

Lenny (32:57):
I'd love to pull on that thread. I was thinking about the fact that you're building software for product teams and so you have a really unique perspective on product teams and you've seen a lot of product teams a lot more than a lot of other folks. And so I was curious what percentage of teams that you see are what you'd call like top notch, highly functional product teams?

Janna Bastow (33:18):
That's a good question. I don't think I've got an answer there because it's going to be biased, because we naturally attract companies who self-select our way of working. We put on our site, no timelines come for the now, next, later. So it's going to be a much higher percentage. People don't sign up for demos with us if they know that they want a timeline nowadays, because we make it really clear. So I would say like 70% of them are like we want now, next, later. And I know that's not real. I know that's not the real state of people, of product teams out there.

Lenny (33:48):
Cool. So yeah, that makes sense.

Janna Bastow (33:49):
I do have a sense that it's increasing. So what I have found is years ago when we first started this thing off, no one was talking this way. It was a whole new concept and people are like, "No, this is crazy doc, you can't do it this way." Then over the years it has just become the natural way that people are working on it. People are going, "Of course this is the way that it works. Why would it work any other way?" It's becoming the expected way. Definitely changed the discourse and changed the expectations of the audience, I guess.

Lenny (34:13):
Putting the now next later piece to the site for one moment. I'm curious what else have you seen separates the best product teams from mediocre product teams? In terms of how they execute, the people they hire, processes, is there anything else that you've noticed of just like this team, when I think of teams that are functioning super well? Other than implementing this process you're recommending, is there anything else that often comes up?

Janna Bastow (34:37):
Yeah, a couple things. A focus on discovery. So this ability to spend time in discovery and asking questions of customers and constantly being able to iterate based on that. And psychological safety, so teams who are able to question each other, speak up when they see that things are wrong, question what's going on at the senior level, question what's going on at different team levels, and generally just have the good sense of what's going on across their business because they're allowed to ask those questions, less silos.

Lenny (35:05):
Thanks. What's a lasting change that a team has made that made them significantly better at building product? Is it these two things, doing more discovery and maybe more safety? I imagine part of your answer will be implementing this way of working of now, next, later. Is there anything else that comes to mind? "Wow, wow, this one team did this one thing and it made things so much better for them."

Janna Bastow (35:24):
Like retrospectives. Retrospectives make such a big difference because they are indicative of psychological safety, which underpins so much, right? Once you start building in this psychological safety, the ability to ask questions and to start saying, "What are we doing that's working? What are we doing that's not working? Okay, determine that something doesn't work. Are we allowed to go change it? Okay, we are allowed to go change it." Okay, this is a team who's now changing their situation. They're talking to each other, they're learning from each other, and they're making a concerted effort to do so. And so these are the teams who are constantly learning, iterating, and moving forwards.

Janna Bastow (36:03):
And they naturally move towards things like now, next, later. They naturally move towards things like doing discovery, because these are just, I don't know, they're kind of common sense. They're not setting in stone expectations of what's going to be done and when. Because that was really only done because some head honcho wanted to see that information. That wasn't psychological safety. That was somebody pinning them down by the neck saying, "Tell me what's going to be done and when." Psychological safety is just saying, "Hey, tell me as much information as you know and then do discovery to learn as much as you can, so that we can move forward with this." It's all about just talking to your teammates and getting the most information as you can from the resources you have, making the most of the collective intelligence that you have within your company.

Lenny (36:46):
Coming back to the now, next, later approach, you're often doing something really hard at companies, which is changing their way of working and changing their product culture. And I'm curious what you've learned about what it takes to change product development culture and product culture and the way of working at larger companies.

Janna Bastow (37:04):
Larger companies are tough. They're tougher. I think of culture as calcification. So calcification being the limestone that is built up as watered run over and that sort of thing. And in order to fix it, you can kind of chip it off over time. You can't just fix it all in one go. And so in order to fix it, you've got to chip away at it. You've got to find a small pocket somewhere. You've got to make use of the tools that you've got. So sometimes it might be finding a small subset of the company and saying, 'Hey, here's the startup lab within the business. Let's let them run off and go do something." Because changing the mindset of the whole company is just too difficult. It's set in stone, and it's stuck where it is and can't change them all at once. But we can change this one little space right here, because we've got a shit hot leader who knows what they're doing and we can take this pocket of people and go do something here.

Janna Bastow (38:00):
And then they're going to teach the rest of the company. They're going to teach this section and then this section and then this section. You don't have to go and change the whole company all at once, but it does take buy-in from above. And sometimes that can be really difficult to take, because the incentives from above are often misaligned with the incentives that it takes to get a company moving this direction.

Janna Bastow (38:21):
Ultimately, a lot of these larger companies, they're incentivized to keep the company as stable as possible, to keep the company just growing quarter on quarter. Which is great for the stock market, they love that stability, they love that quarter on quarter growth. But if the company is actually under threat from startups, if you're a big bank, you're in health tech, something like that, you almost certainly have startups nipping at your heels. And the reality is that you probably have enough cash to make it for the next 20 years or so, but over time it's going to get bitten away at.

Janna Bastow (38:58):
And you've got smaller startups who are going to take the juicier, more interesting parts of your business and leave you with the tougher parts of your business. Take HSBC versus all the companies who are coming out with got a Starling account here and I've got a mortgage with somebody else and you've got your savings account somewhere else. You've got all these smaller startups nipping at their heels. These companies are going to nip away at these larger businesses and if these larger companies don't actually do something with it, they're actually going to end up losing this ability to innovate themselves. And so these companies are essentially stuck in this pattern where they want to continue growing and yet they're not going to, they're going to end up not being willing to take the dip to move upwards.

Lenny (39:42):
What's the biggest company that you've implemented this new way of building? And is that how you approached it, you found a team within the larger company to roll out this new-

Janna Bastow (39:53):
Yes.

Lenny (39:53):
... yeah, this framework?

Janna Bastow (39:54):
Yeah. So that's how it generally works with the way that we work with our enterprise rollouts is like we worked with large enterprises of governments as well. It generally starts with an advocate, somebody who gets the way that we're working, a division, a department, and then it starts from there. Sometimes what we'll find is that we'll get one or two, sometimes three or four many groups starting and then they'll start banding together and saying, "Hey, no, we're starting a thing here." Once that starts happening, it's easier to start that conversation saying, "Okay, yeah, we've got a whole thing going here. Let's talk to the person who is the VP of strategy, or who owns the tech area," and then we can have a bigger conversation.

Lenny (40:33):
What's the impact that you saw at that company having taken on this new way of building product?

Janna Bastow (40:39):
So we're in the middle of a key tool in the middle of transformations right now, which is fascinating to see. These are multi-year pieces of work where you're seeing it being used for ongoing products that are being used and delivered as we speak, as well as part of a mindset shift within the business. Because one of the things about ProdPad is that it's not just a tool to help you deliver your products, it's actually a tool that helps you become a better product manager. It sets in stone better product management practices. Once you start using it, it makes it difficult to go back to bad product management practices.

Janna Bastow (41:15):
When you create a roadmap in ProdPad, it makes difficult to add features and dates to the roadmap. It makes it difficult to make a timeline based roadmap. It makes it difficult to add ideas to the backlog that are not thought through, because it asks questions, thoughtful questions, like what problem does this solve? And why would you want to solve it? And what are the outcomes? And what did you get?So it makes it difficult to fall into a build trap with just saying, "Here's stuff to build," and we built it, and move on to the next thing, like a lot of dev tools are designed to do. Because it has spaces in there to say, "Did you measure success? And was it successful or not successful? This roadmap thing is completed, what was the outcome of it?" So by creating all these spaces, it creates all these reminders for the team to go back and think about this stuff before they do work and after they do work. So it actually actively helps them become better product teams and more cognizant of this sort of work.

Lenny (42:05):
If someone wanted to experiment with now, next, later, what would be a good place to go and just start to play around with it?

Janna Bastow (42:12):
I mean, you can start a free trial in ProdPad, you can start playing around with it. We even have a sandbox mode. You just go to sandbox.prodpad.com where it's got example versions of roadmaps, best practice roadmaps that you can just start playing with. You don't even need a login or a credit card. It's got OKRs and roadmaps and ideas and experiments, feedback. You see how it all sort of fits together. But honestly, a now, next, later roadmap can be done with Post-It Notes on the wall. It's just about saying, "What problems do you have? Let's lay them out in order and just check them with other people."

Janna Bastow (42:45):
So the whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level. So at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody, and say, "Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?" And they tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you make a new one.

Janna Bastow (43:27):
So the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process. The value isn't in your roadmap, The value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, "I think we have this problem then this problem. What do you think?" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody, who will listen. And just check that you're on the right path. And if they say, "Oh, actually I thought that it was going to go this way, this way, then this way, or that way, then the other way, and what about this problem?" You've actually learned something. You can adjust your prototype for your strategy, you can adjust your roadmap there and your roadmap all of a sudden becomes stronger, becomes better there.

Lenny (44:11):
For folks that are listening and they're just like, "Nah, this is never going to work where I work. It's just too out there, too radical. No deadlines, that's crazy." I know you're not saying no deadlines, but less deadlines. What are the most powerful three bullet points you could share with listeners that are just like, :Here's why you should have confidence this might actually work at your company."

Janna Bastow (44:32):
Other teams are already working this way. Product people are the only ones who seem to be pinned down to be required to give concrete dates as to when things are going to be delivered in this way. Your sales team isn't asked to give exact delivery dates on their work. They work in a very experimentation led way as well. You are VP sales or VP revenue or whoever doesn't go to a board meeting and say, "We're going to close the Acme deal at the end of October for a million pounds." They don't know that. What they do know is that they have a process by which they're going to fill a pipeline, and almost certainly they're going to be able to close a million pounds or a million dollars worth of sales, but they can't tell you who it's going to come from or how that's going to work.

Janna Bastow (45:19):
What they're going to say is, "Give me a quarter million dollars worth of investment into my team, which I'm going to spend that on my account executives, my sales team. They're going to pick up the phone and do a bunch of calls." Think of these calls as experiments. These calls, some of them are going to work, some of them are going to fail. They don't know which ones are going to work and which ones are going to fail. What they do know is that by using a script and by picking up the phone and calling people, some are going to work. And by the end of the quarter someone's going to buy. And they know this because last quarter someone bought and the quarter before that someone bought, they just don't know who's going to buy. If they did know who's going to buy, then they would just call those people and not everybody else.

Janna Bastow (45:59):
Same thing. You're not asking for any more leeway than your sales team. You're saying that you want a quarter million dollars worth of investment, and you're going to spend it on your team who's going to run experiments, right? It's going to be trying this change on the interface or that tweak to the pricing or that change to the positioning or whatever you're going to do. Some of these experiments are going to fail and some are going to succeed. You don't know which ones. But that's okay, you know that by the end of the quarter, enough are going to succeed that you're probably going to move the right numbers in the right direction.

Janna Bastow (46:30):
So you're not asking for any more leeway than your salesperson. What you should be able to do is point at how many experiments you ran the previous quarter, and what numbers moved in the right direction. You should be accountable for your experiments and how you're spending the money and what you're doing. But you shouldn't be accountable for saying what is going to work before you know what's going to work yet. And that's the problem with this timeline delivery, Magic 8 Ball that we're asked to give.

Lenny (46:58):
I like that. Two last questions before we get to a very exciting lightning round, which I didn't tell you about. We'll see how that goes. So one is you have an interesting framework for coming up with a product vision, and I don't know if you have this in your head loaded up, but I'm curious how you think about coming up with a product vision. You have this really handy little framework, and vision is always this thing that people are like, "Man, how do I come up with a vision? How do I phrase a vision? How do I even visualize my team's mission?" Can you share that with us, if you have that in your head?

Janna Bastow (47:30):
The product vision template, you might actually recognize it from the Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm book. It's the elevator pitch template. But I like it because it answers the same sort of questions that you need to answer for a product vision template. So it asks things like, for your target customer, who the statement of need or the opportunity. The product name is a product category. What's the reason to buy? And then say, unlike this alternative our product, and then say what this statement of differentiation is. So it's actually a template that we have available on our site, and you can actually fill out as part of our product canvas in ProdPad. So happy to share that link with you, so you can link it up and send it to your audience here, Lenny.

Lenny (48:17):
Cool. Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes. I think that's the same framework as the positioning exercise. I might be wrong, but if so, that's cool. So basically you could use your positioning work to help figure out your vision. And just like a vision, it's basically a vision statement, it's not necessarily the vision for your product, it's just kind of how you think about where it's going to go.

Janna Bastow (48:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (48:36):
Okay, cool. The last question, you were a PM now you're founder, so you moved from PM to founder, and a lot of PMs, imagine being founders someday. I'm curious if you have any advice for folks that are currently PMs that may want to be founders in the future. What do you think they should be working on, focusing on, skills, vision rebuilding, things they should be doing to help them in that future career?

Janna Bastow (48:58):
Being a PM actually provides you with a lot of the skills and background to be a founder, to be a CEO. It gives you a lot of chance to work with a lot of the different teams and see a lot of the underpinnings of how business works. I was really lucky in previous roles where I got to work very closely with leadership in a few different roles before I took the step up to take on my own thing. So I felt as if I'd seen it in a few different ways, done well and done badly, and so I got a chance to sort of say, "Ah, I think I could do this. Yeah, go on."

Janna Bastow (49:32):
One of the things that struck me is it's not as hard as it looks, and it's also harder than it looks. There's things that you get started and you go, oh, no one's going to stop you from doing this. You've got lots of leeway. You can just do it, and you've got lots of freedom to run your business how you want to do it. There's lots of resource out there. As long as you surround yourself with people, you're always going to be able to find people to advise you and to help you along the way. And there's always going to be bumps. You don't know what they're going to be yet. There's always going to be things that are going to come by and side swipe you, but that's always the case that you had when you are product manager as well.

Janna Bastow (50:11):
And just be ready for those and be ready to take it on the chin and deal with them as they come. Best thing you can do is surround yourself with people so that you've got somebody to go to for each thing. Going, "Oh, when I run into a problem that has to do with this, I can talk to this person. When I run into a problem that has to do with this, I talked to one of these people." And figure it out as you go. Take each thing a day at time. Certainly, don't stop yourself from starting a business or starting your own thing, just because you don't think that you know how to do it yet. You will figure it out as you go ahead. People less capable than you have figured it out.

Lenny (50:46):
Awesome. Okay. We've reached our lightning round. The way it's going to work, I'm going to ask you five questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, share an answer.

Janna Bastow (50:55):
Cool.

Lenny (50:56):
If nothing comes to mind, that's also cool. Sound good?

Janna Bastow (50:58):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (50:59):
What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people, whether they're product leaders or just generally?

Janna Bastow (51:06):
Art of Profitability, I thought was a really good one.

Lenny (51:09):
What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you've watched?

Janna Bastow (51:13):
Oh, Sandman.

Lenny (51:14):
Ooh, and that's-

Janna Bastow (51:16):
Sandman is-

Lenny (51:16):
... like a British show, right?

Janna Bastow (51:17):
Oh, it is British. Yes, by Neil Gaiman. Yeah, very good. Definitely, not for children. Thought it might be, definitely not.

Lenny (51:25):
Noted. What's another favorite podcast of yours other than the one you're currently on?

Janna Bastow (51:31):
Ooh, Startups For the Rest Of Us.

Lenny (51:33):
Wow, I haven't heard of that one. Tell us more.

Janna Bastow (51:36):
Basically, it's Rob Walling's podcast and it's for startups that are either bootstrapped or alt funded. Basically, the startups that aren't the one percent top end funded, unicorns, but the startups for the rest of us.

Lenny (51:52):
Awesome. What's a favorite interview question of yours that you like to ask?

Janna Bastow (51:57):
I like asking people what problems that they're looking to solve. Why are they coming to this table?

Lenny (52:03):
Very PMy question.

Janna Bastow (52:05):
Yes.

Lenny (52:05):
Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader? Who comes to mind?

Janna Bastow (52:10):
I've got to give a shout out to Christina Wodtke. I had a great conversation with her yesterday, and I've had a chance to chat with her a number of times over the years, but she's just got this illustrious career. She's been part of so many amazing teams, built some amazing things, written some amazing books, and is also just an all round amazing product person and amazing person all in one.

Lenny (52:32):
Janna, this has been amazing. I think we covered a lot of different topics, more than we often cover in a podcast like this. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they'd like to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Janna Bastow (52:45):
Wonderful. Hi, I'm Janna Bastow. You can find me all on Twitter, I'm simplybastow there. Or come find me on LinkedIn, connect with me, I'm Janna Bastow. I'm easy to find there. And come check out ProdPad. It'd be wonderful to get your feedback on it, because we are a team of product people and we love hearing what other product people think of the product. We're always open to feedback. We're constantly pushing new releases. So check it out, try the sandbox. We'd love to hear from you.

Lenny (53:11):

## Transcript

Jason Fried (00:00:00):
The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money, and they get better, and better, and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to run a successful business, which is to make money. Hopefully, I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is, this is a way to be. It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry, which is, "Go big or go home. Raise a bunch of money and get huge, and unicorn status," and the whole thing. That's a way. Just know though that basically almost nobody makes it that way. Really, almost nobody really makes it that way, and there's a lot more room to make it, and to build a successful business, if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Today, my guest is Jason Fried. Jason is the Co-Founder and CEO of 37signals, which makes Basecamp and HEY, and soon a few more products including a competitor to Slack. 37signals is a very different type of company. They have no investors, no board. They have no plans to go public. They never want to sell their business. They've made a profit for 24 years in a row. They have over 100,000 customers and make tens of millions of dollars in profit each year, which most VC-backed companies never make a dollar of. All of this profit filters down to the founders and employees because they have no investors. Most founders, by default, will go down the venture route raising money from VCs and Angels. For many types of companies, that is necessary. But it's also important to know that there is a different option available, and it can be much more fulfilling and fun, and even much more lucrative, by bootstrapping your idea.

(00:01:43):
In my conversation with Jason, we get into why constraints like small teams and less cash often lead to better outcomes. Why gut and instinct is underappreciated as a decision-making tool. Why planning long-term is often a mistake. Why work doesn't have to feel like war. Why we should focus on playing infinite games. When it makes sense to consider raising venture capital versus bootstrapping. How to actually bootstrap your startup, so much more. Jason is fascinating, and he's got a lot of wisdom to share. I'm excited to be able to bring you this conversation. With that, I bring you Jason Fried, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:20):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. Within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback. Essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:02:58):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets, and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location, regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback.

(00:04:15):
Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

Jason, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Jason Fried (00:05:03):
Thanks, Lenny. It's good to be here.

Lenny (00:05:04):
It's really good to have you on. I have this new segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner, and I have this feeling like this entire episode is going to be Contrarian Corner. I'm excited to dig into all kinds of stuff. I have so many questions I want to ask you. I thought it'd be good to just start with giving people who aren't that familiar with your story and 37signals, a sense of just how successful the business has been. I think people don't quite get the business you've built, and the scale you've built. So whatever you can share in terms of customers, profits, anything you are comfortable sharing, I'd love to give people... Especially things that might surprise people, just a sense of like, "Wow, this business is not what I imagined."

Jason Fried (00:05:44):
We don't talk about things that don't really matter so much, like revenues don't really matter 'cause you can go broke generating a lot of money. But, we talk about profits. Historically, let's say over the past 10 years or so, we've been profitable every year for 24 years. But let's say over the last 10 years, we've been doing double-digit million dollar profits on an annual basis, which is really nice. We have about a 100,000 plus paying customers, so that's a rough number, and we've about currently 75 or so employees.

(00:06:12):
So, a relatively small business in terms of the number of people who work here, big customer base, big profits, and that's how we like to keep it, and that's something that we've always focused on, versus a lot of these other metrics that I hear a lot, and usually there's acronyms attached to them, and of don't even know what they are, and I don't really care about them so much. We just want to make more money than we spend, have good healthy margins which allow us to experiment, and play, and not be afraid to do things that may not work, and just enjoy ourselves. So that's what we've been doing for almost 25 years. Next year will be our 25th year in business.

Lenny (00:06:47):
Just following the same thread, the bet that companies are making, obviously going down the venture route, they're going to lose money for a long time so that they can make much, much more money in the future. So the idea there is, grow as fast as possible, as big as possible, and then we'll make money. You're a big advocate of not raising venture and bootstrapping. So what's your advice to founders for when raising money makes sense? I actually wrote this article, one's called, Your Startup Is Probably Not Venture-Scale, just trying to convince people, you may have a really good idea, but it doesn't mean it's a venture-scale business. I feel like we're aligned on this. What's your advice to founders there?

Jason Fried (00:07:25):
Obviously, if you're building cars, or you need a factory, or you're opening a restaurant and there's actual things you need to buy like ovens, and you need to hire people right off the bat, and you need to pay rent, you need capital. It could come from you. It could come from friends and family. It could come from an investor. It can come from a bank loan. There's lots of places to get it, but you'd need it. Software businesses though, and businesses like ours, we just make software, and a lot of people in our industry are like us in that respect. They need a couple laptops and a couple people, and it's pretty cheap. It's really pretty cheap to get going, and the margins are incredibly healthy in software, or they should be.

(00:08:06):
What's interesting is that Silicon Valley has found a way to make the most profitable style of business the least profitable. Software, there's no physical costs. The margin should be close to 80 or 90%. It turns out that they're barely even, most of them positive in the end, or they're just sliding by basically. I don't understand how that... Well, I do. They have too many people and they spend too much money on customer acquisition, and all that. But, it blows me away. Most businesses in the world would love to have Silicon Valley style economics, make something that doesn't cost much to make and then sell it for high prices.

(00:08:50):
But everyone, the corner store, the pizza shop, they wish they could do this, and they can't because they have physical products that they have to sell, and they have to buy goods, and they have to get raw materials and convert that into a pizza, and there's just costs involved with that. They can't sell it for too much because the other place down the street sells it for less. So again, I'm getting off track, but if you're going to start a business that really truly requires cash, typically capital expenditures, expensive things, hardware, whatever, of course you need that. But, I don't think you do otherwise.

(00:09:20):
I think it actually hurts you if you go out and think that you do, because there really is only one outcome for venture-backed companies, which is go huge. If you think about all of the space between a small business and a massive, huge unicorn-y business, there's so much room there that you could normally find your own way, and slide into a slot or a place that makes sense for you. But if you're venture-backed, you just don't even have the opportunity. You blow right past those, or they want you to blow right past those. If you don't, you wither on the vine and die essentially, and it's just too bad.

Lenny (00:09:58):
Coming back to something we touched on a bit, is this idea of smaller teams. You tweeted a similar stats, so I'm just going to read these numbers, in terms of your competitors. Asana has 1600 employees. ClickUp has a thousand employees. Slack has 2,500 employees. Smartsheet has 3000 employees. Monday has 1500 employees. You have, I think you said, 70 something employees?

Jason Fried (00:10:20):
Yep.

Lenny (00:10:22):
You have similar numbers of customers, about 100,000 to 150,000, and you make a lot of profit and they generally don't. How is this possible?

Jason Fried (00:10:31):
We run a very different kind of business. We are focused on efficiency, we're not focused on growth. They're focused on growth. So typically, when you have a lot of people, you think you can do more things at once, and you probably can. You do more things at once, and have different offerings to different people, and different tiers, and salespeople, and all the things that build up an organization. We don't have any salespeople. We don't have 15 different versions of Basecamp. We're not after enterprise, so we don't have the enormous support costs and enormous support infrastructure required to service customers like that, and customize this and customize that to keep a whale happy who's paying you $300,000 a year.

(00:11:13):
We don't have any of those things. We have one price, basically. Well, we have two prices on Basecamp, one price on HEY. Actually, two prices on HEY. Two, basically. But one code base, one product we offer everybody. Let's take Basecamp for example. Nobody can pay us more than 300 bucks. I don't care how big your company is, the most you can pay us is $299, you get unlimited users. What that allows us to do is to just build one product, do a really nice job, keep it tight, and simple, and clear, and not have the complexity that comes with trying to service and satisfy so many different kinds of companies at different price levels with different price points and different expectations. That's why these companies tend to get bigger and bigger and bigger.

(00:11:58):
They also, frankly, build products just differently. We build products with two people at a time. So every feature we work on in Basecamp, or HEY, or whatever we're building is two people, one programmer, one designer, and they have a maximum of six weeks to deliver the feature that they're working on. Most of them are usually a couple of weeks, but they have a maximum of six weeks. So we don't get stuck in these big huge projects, with meetings with 18 people, and slow decision-making, and indecision, and complexity, and all the things that come with trying to do too many things for too many people. Now, all that said, we could still make the mistake of hiring hundreds of people because we could afford to do so. But to spend money because you have it on things you don't need is something that Silicon Valley's gotten quite good at, but we're quite bad at intentionally. I don't want to spend money on things we don't need.

(00:12:49):
So we think that constraints, simplicity, small teams actually are where it's at, and keep us honest, and allow us to do great work for our customer base that we know, small businesses, very tight companies like ours, and satisfy them versus trying to go after the big companies, and have to have salespeople, and have long sales cycles, and whatnot. Honestly, if you gave me 1,000 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. If you gave me 500 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. We would be a worse off company with 500 people. I'd be completely lost. So, that's the other thing. I don't even understand how they run, and the amount of layers they must need, and the amount of complexity organizationally that they must have to... The latticework they have to build up to support all that weight, is just remarkable and it's foreign to us.

Lenny (00:13:39):
Okay. I definitely want to talk about how you operate in your way of working, 'cause it's really interesting and there's a lot companies can take away. But, I want to follow on this thread of small teams. I have a few quotes that you've shared that I love.

Jason Fried (00:13:50):
Oh, no.

Lenny (00:13:50):
Oh, no.

Jason Fried (00:13:52):
No, good. No, it's good. Hey, if I said it, I said it. Let's go.

Lenny (00:13:55):
No, they're awesome. They're great. Around this idea of staying small, one is, "Small is not just a stepping stone, small is a great destination itself. Also, if you think you're too small to be effective, you've never been in bed with a mosquito."

Jason Fried (00:14:08):
Now that's not my quote. That's someone else's, to be clear.

Lenny (00:14:10):
Okay. Okay, you popularized it.

Jason Fried (00:14:11):
It's a great quote though.

Lenny (00:14:12):
Okay. Then there's one more. "You don't need to outdo the competition, it's expensive and defensive. Underdo your competition. We need more simplicity and clarity." I think a lot of these things point to, there's a few paths to success and goals for people. One is build a massively scaled, everyone's using a product like Figma and Notion, and build a venture scale, $100 billion company. Then there's this path which is, we're just going to make a bunch of profit we're going to make individually. We're going to take home a bunch of cash. We're not trying to have everyone in the world use it. I know your focus is, you call it, the Fortune 5 million versus the Fortune 500. So maybe just whatever you want to share about what success means to you, how you think about what success is for you, for the company your building.

Jason Fried (00:14:53):
For me, it's really about, would I want to do this again? If the answer is, "Yeah, that was enjoyable. I enjoyed that. That was worthwhile. I'm glad I did that. I'd like to do that again," then it was successful. Now you could carve out some extremes there. I'm sure someone who's addicted to drugs might go, "That felt great, I should do that again." So you got to be careful with that, in a sense. Obviously, I'm not talking about that. Addiction's a whole different story. But in general, with this stuff, "That was fun. Let's do that again. That worked. Let's do that again." Or, "That didn't work. I didn't like that. That was a pain in the ass. That was too complicated. That took too long. Let's not do that again." So it really is about, do you want to do that again? That's what success is to us at a root level.

(00:15:37):
Now, on the business side of things, we have to be profitable. That doesn't mean that everything we do needs to be profitable. I am not driven by data, or I don't have different P&Ls for each product in a way where we're looking at them very carefully. It's in total, collectively, are we making more money than we spend? That's the only thing we ultimately look at, whether or not this product is more profitable than that product, and this is behind that, it's all the things we do. It's all the things we do. I don't even think you can actually draw lines back to everything and go, "That was worth it. That wasn't worth it." What is the value of saying thank you to somebody? Would you want to A/B test that and, if it turned out that it was worse to say thank you to somebody, would you not do that? No, you would do it because it's still the right thing to do.

(00:16:28):
So a lot of our things are, what feels right? What seems like the decent thing to do? What things do we enjoy making? As long as we can, at the end of the year, look back and go, "Well, collectively, more worked then didn't work," then we're okay. That's how we look at it. We don't have financial goals. We don't have OKRs or KPIs. I don't have revenue targets. I don't have growth targets, in terms of the number of customers we need to pick up this year versus last year. I don't look at any of those things. It's just, at the end, "Did we make more than we spend? We did. Then the things we did this year were worth it." That's how it goes.

Lenny (00:17:08):
You also have no investors. You have no board. You have no plans to go public. You have no plans to sell the business.

Jason Fried (00:17:13):
Right.

Lenny (00:17:14):
There's this book, I don't know if you've read this book called, Finite and Infinite Games.

Jason Fried (00:17:18):
No, I've not.

Lenny (00:17:20):
Okay. I think you would love it. The whole premise of this book, it's like a terse, tricky, philosophical book, but it's very short. It espouses, you want to be playing infinite games to be happy in life, games that never end versus games like, I'm going to build a business and sell it. Or, I'm going to go public, that's my goal. Or, I want to achieve this promotion. You get most joy out of things that never end, like building great relationships, building a company you want to keep working at forever.

Jason Fried (00:17:45):
I like that. What's interesting is, I've always thought of my career this way. When I got my first job, I was 13. I worked in a grocery store for a bit, and then I worked in a shoe store. After that, maybe when I was 15, I got a resellers license, which was this thing... This is way back in the day. I think they still exists. A company called Ingram Micro D, which had this huge thick catalog of electronics equipment. If you had a resellers license, you could buy these things at wholesale prices, then I could sell them to my friends for retail, which is almost 2x wholesale. Even though I'm not selling electronics equipment today, I'm selling software instead, I feel like I have the exact same job as I did when I was 15, that this is a long continuum of finding stuff that I like.

(00:18:31):
In this case today, it's building things that I like, and selling them to like-minded people who also would find them useful or those things too. So whether or not it's software, or electronics, or stereo equipment, or whatever the heck it is, or music organizing databases, it's all the same to me, and I just want to keep doing it. This is my day job. The other thing that's interesting about entrepreneurship is, sometimes there's a sense of, you can get a job or you can be an entrepreneur. Well, an entrepreneur is a job. This is my job, so I want to create the company that I want to work at, and I want to keep doing this job for as long as I can. As long as I'm useful, I'm good at it, I enjoy it, I want to keep doing that.

(00:19:14):
So to get in bed with an investment that would say, "In five years you have to stop doing what you're doing, you're going to get a big paycheck maybe, but you got to stop doing what you're doing because we're going to sell this business, and you're going to have to go work for this other company for two years and do their thing. Then eventually, after that's over, you'll leave and you'll go start another thing," that just has no appeal to me at all. I'd rather just keep doing the thing that I'm enjoying doing, as long as I can continue to make it work.

(00:19:37):
What's cool about having a company like ours, which is an independent business, we don't have to ask anyone for permission. No one can tell us no. So we can turn this into anything we want. It's this vehicle, more so than it is a software business. It happens to be, of course, what it is, but it could be something else as well. There's no limits to what it could be, and that's a fun way to go through life too, in this all-terrain vehicle which can anywhere, on-road, off-road, whatever, and you can get anywhere you need to go. That's what's really quite fun about the kind of business we have.

Lenny (00:20:12):
You have this term you hold, instead of a startup it's a stay up.

Jason Fried (00:20:15):
Yes. I'm so sick of the startups. It's cool to start a business, obviously, but I'm sick of that term dominating. Because, frankly, starting a business is actually way easier than staying in business. Now, none of it's easy, so I want to be supportive of people who are starting businesses. But they should know that that's actually not the hard part. Literally tomorrow, I can start a new business. You can come up with a name, and you can make a thing, and you can put in the app store, and you can sell it for two bucks, and you've got a business going. But, are you going to be there in two years? Are you going to be there in five years when competition rushes in? When you have employees, are you going to be there? Staying is harder than starting. So I'm here to celebrate stay ups. Plenty of other people are here to celebrate startups.

Lenny (00:21:01):
I feel the same way. I always say this about newsletters, and it's also true for podcasts. Easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going.

Jason Fried (00:21:07):
Totally. I've seen your newsletter fly. We have a newsletter and it's been pretty flat. I'm like, "How does he do it?" It's hard. It's really hard. It's hard to build a podcast audience. It's hard to build a newsletter audience. So yeah, starting something is really easy, but then most people end up in this plateau area, 'cause they get some initial growth, the word gets out, and they end up with 6,000 somethings, and then you're stuck there. Then it's like, "Well, do you want to keep doing this? Or, are you just high on the growth? Or, do you actually like the thing?"

(00:21:42):
If you want to do the thing for a long period of time, you've got to like the thing because you're going to have to endure these moments of plateaus, which is what staying up is all about. Sometimes those go down. We've had wavy years, always been profitable, but our profit's different every year. Sometimes it's more, and sometimes it's less. Sometimes our margin is more, sometimes it's less. If you compare yourself to the previous year, you can get demoralized to some degree. But I just, "What do we want to keep doing?," and then we're in it to stay in it.

Lenny (00:22:13):
Speaking of enduring, you've been at this for almost 25 years now, I believe?

Jason Fried (00:22:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:19):
Have there been periods where... I like that sigh that you just had there.

Jason Fried (00:22:24):
It's a long time.

Lenny (00:22:25):
So maybe along that path, one, is there a point at which maybe you started going off track and you realized, "This is not what I want to be doing. Why did I do this to myself?" Then two is just, what have you learned being at this for this long?

Jason Fried (00:22:36):
I would say, over the past few years, I've had more thoughts of, "How long should I do this for?" I go back and forth. I can tell you, what's interesting is, right now, I'm probably more excited than I've been in many years. But, a year ago I was not so excited. I think that after you've been doing this for a while, you do tend to just compare, what was it like in the early days? What's it like now? All the new things that are harder weren't harder before, and now they're hard today. Do I like doing this kind of hard work, or would I rather do...? You just amass this history, and so you tend to just call back to it, and look back to it. So you opine for the early days, or you reminisce, I should say.

(00:23:16):
"Yeah, it was so much easier when we were 20 people." "Yeah, but we weren't doing this, and times were different, and you can't go back anyway." But, it's interesting. Next year I'll be 50. We'll be doing this 25 years. I'll have been running this company for 25 years. Part of me thinks, "Is that enough? Maybe that's enough." But right now, I'm really excited about what we're doing. We're doing some really great product work, probably the best we've done in many, many years. Launching this new thing called ONCE, which hopefully we're going to build three or so products next year under that category. I would like to write another book. We finally have another idea for another book.

(00:23:53):
So there's just, right now, this outpouring of energy. I'm trying to be very conscious of my energy interest. Right now, I'm getting energy from the business. There are times in the past where the business sapped energy for me. If it SAPs too much, at some point, you start to think, "Is it worth it? Do I want to keep doing this?" Right now, I'm fueled again by it. But, I don't know what it'll be like in a year from now. I really don't know. I think I'm more conscious of that than I've ever been given how long I've been doing this.

(00:24:21):
Also, I always have this strange fantasy, I'm always curious, "What would someone else do with this place? What if someone else could just step in tomorrow? How would they run it? No one's ever had a chance to run it but me. What would they do differently?" I'd have to be completely detached from it to let them really run with it. But, what would they do? I always have this curious about that, I would say. Not curious enough to find out, but still curious. It's always in the back of my head.

Lenny (00:24:49):
What do you think they'd do?

Jason Fried (00:24:50):
I think they'd probably be focused on growth. I think there's opportunities that we miss all the time. I think that we are stuck in a certain... Stuck sounds like a negative term, but I don't mean it that way. But, we're stuck in a certain groove. We do things the way we do things. We change the way we do things here and there, but we're not really jumping into a new groove. I think someone would jump into a new groove and run the company differently, maybe make a lot more products than we're making today. Maybe resurrect a couple of things that we did in the past. Probably spend a lot on advertising, a lot of marketing, probably take our margin way down and try to focus on growth. What if we spent 70% of our margin on growth? What would that look like? I just feel like that's what most people would probably come in with a business like ours and do. They go, "Oh my god, there's so many missed opportunities here. Look at this, and look at this, and look at this. You've got this brand, and people know about you, and you've got 100,000 paying customers. Think about all the things you could do." I'm not really thinking about all the things we could do. I'm thinking about what we're doing. So I think someone else would come in and think about the things we could do.

(00:25:49):
I'm thinking about the things we are doing, with a little bit of a look ahead to things we could also do, but they're still pretty close to what we're doing today. So, that's what I think would happen. It'd be interesting. It'd be neat to live in a reality where there could be a second reality running right alongside you, truly. Not an A/B test, which is hard to do. You can't really A/B test an entire company. I'd seek to A/B test small things. But, it'd be cool if that was something that could happen. Maybe there's some simulation down the road.

Lenny (00:26:16):
I was just thinking-

Jason Fried (00:26:16):
It's a possibility.

Lenny (00:26:17):
Maybe we're in the simulation variant where you're still running it.

Jason Fried (00:26:20):
It could be.

Lenny (00:26:21):
And there's another... This a cool exercise, actually, just to think about it. If I were to bring in any leader, what would they do? Just as a thought exercise.

Jason Fried (00:26:28):
This is a weird way to think about it, but I almost would be embarrassed by what someone would come in and look at, and go, "Oh my God, you guys are missing so many opportunities here." I'd be like, "Yeah, I know. I know we are, but I'm totally fine with it." But, there'd be this moment of judgment and reckoning with, "Do you realize how much you're leaving on the table?" You could have five different pricing tiers, and make a lot more money, and you can maximize this and maximize that, and squeeze this and squeeze that, and address this market, and you could have special versions of Basecamp. Wow, churches are using Basecamp? We could do a special version for churches, and for synagogues, and religious institutions, or education or nonprofits. Think of all the slight different things you could do with these different..."

(00:27:06):
I'm certain that all those opportunities exist on the table. They don't interest me, personally, in terms of making multiple products. But I could see someone else going, "There's a huge opportunity here. We got to pursue this." I'd be really proud if someone did that, and made the business bigger and better. I could never have done that. I'm glad someone else did that. But right now, we're running it our way.

Lenny (00:27:29):
Coming back to this as a path people can take with their business versus a traditional venture scale business, this path is essentially build something, sell it, make money, live like a chill life. Not super stressed, growth-focused obsessed, need to build a billion-dollar company. Do you think this path is something everyone should do? Is it a specific type of personality, a specific type of product? Do you recommend people that sometimes do go this big shot venture scale route?

Jason Fried (00:27:59):
I'm glad there are some people who do that. I'm glad that there's some businesses that-

Jason Fried (00:28:00):
People who do that. I'm glad that there's some businesses that wouldn't have worked out had they not taken a bunch of funding and went big, clearly. And there's many impressive businesses that do that. But let's face it, those are extreme outliers. The majority of companies on this planet run like ours. They're bootstrapped, they don't have any money. No one's willing to give them a penny and they open up a shop somewhere, they do something, they put their shingle out and they launch a website or whatever and they try to make it work. So most people are doing it our way, even though in our industry it seems like we're the outliers, but we're not. We're actually incredibly boring and mainstream, really. If you were to pick any random business owner on the street, they'd run their business like us. I got to make more money than I spend otherwise I'm out. I don't have this big cushion of millions sitting in the bank that I can just spend on things.

(00:28:48):
So they're pretty, they keep an eye on costs. They think about this carefully. But yeah, I'm glad there's people who are going for the moonshot and doing it their way and doing it a different way. And the world moves forward sometimes because of those businesses and it's great. It's great and I admire them. It's just that it's not the path I would take and I think because that's not who I am, and I think this is the important point that I want to get across, is I'm not really, hopefully I don't come off as encouraging everyone to be like me. I'm not saying that at all. What I'm saying is this is a way to be. It's an alternative to what you're often hearing in our industry, which is like go big or go home, raise a bunch of money and get huge and unicorn status and the whole thing.

(00:29:29):
That's a way. Just know though that basically almost nobody makes it that way. Really, almost nobody really makes it that way. And there's a lot more room to make it and to build a successful business, if you throw out that outlier and look at all the other places you can land as a business. So my interest is optionality. If I could land in 135 different positions and have a sustainable business, that's great. Versus saying there's only one way I'm going to be successful or happy. Those odds aren't really in anyone's favor. Even though of course some people win the lottery. And I'm not saying it's luck. There is luck, a lot of luck, including we're lucky that we've made it. So there is a degree of that when I say lottery. But really the point is that there's only a few slots for a few companies like that at any one time. Meanwhile, there are hundreds or thousands of slots for other kinds of companies to make it if they don't go for the moon.

Lenny (00:30:31):
Just to close this thought around whether, if you have an idea going the venture route makes sense. What do venture scale companies need to achieve? What investors look for that to even work out? To your point, it almost never works out. What is it you have to do for it to feel like, okay, this is a venture scale idea versus this is an awesome idea. We could just make money every year, every month from it and not raise money and life will be great.

Jason Fried (00:30:54):
I'm probably the wrong person to ask, but I would say there are versions of our... Let's just take Monday for example. Basecamp and Monday are quite a bit different, but they live in the same world. We could have flipped, someone could have had the Monday approach and sold Basecamp that way, and Basecamp could have gone big in that way and Monday could have stayed small in our way. Again, I'd rather be my business than their business. I would not trade Basecamp for Monday's business any day of the week because I love what we're doing. We're profitable, we're happy. We don't have to deal with the things they have to deal with. So I wouldn't trade businesses or places with anybody. But you could imagine it could have been swapped. So it's not that Basecamp couldn't be this big venture scale, whatever you want to call it, although look, hey, we have the same number of customers roughly than they do.

(00:31:46):
Are we? I guess we are venture scale in that respect. But again, point is is that depending on how you approach it, you can take anything in any different direction. So it's more of a mindset, what are you after? We're not after that and they are. So that's what they do. And we do it a different way. So I don't necessarily think... There's things like Airbnb is a great example that that has to have a certain degree of scale to really be something that no matter where you go in the world, you're like, I can get an Airbnb there. And that's probably going to take money to get there. Same thing with Uber. Uber's another example, and these are easy to pick, but they're great examples really. When Uber was getting started and they had to proliferate all over the country to begin with and all over the world.

(00:32:33):
So it was this reliable thing you could think of just you would think of a cab. If I went to New York or Chicago, I knew there'd be a cab. Was there going to be an Uber? I don't know. Well, you have to know that there's going to be one to begin to trust us. So in order to do that, you have to expand rapidly. So there's that kid of, those kind of businesses exist and those are great examples of venture-backed companies that kind of need that massive initial push to be available in all the different places because they're actual physical products. Airbnb's a physical product, Uber's a physical product, Basecamp, Monday, Asana, they're available everywhere instantly anyway. I don't know what you need the money for other than marketing. And it's interesting because marketing's losing them a lot of money. So it's an interesting thing. But anyway, you can talk to them about that.

Lenny (00:33:20):
I want to start chatting about your ways of working, how you operate at 37signals. There's a lot of really unique approaches. One is you mentioned that every project is, I didn't know this. It's two people, a designer and engineer, and then two to six weeks of work. Can you just expand on how you actually do that, how broad development works there?

Jason Fried (00:33:36):
Yeah, so we have framework development framework we invented called Shape Up, and if you go to basecamp.com/shapeup, you can read the book, it's free. You can also get a print version if you want. Shape Up is our methodology for actually building products. And part of this is this idea at the root of it is this idea of the six-week cycle. That whatever we choose to do can take no longer than six weeks. So this is not an estimate of time, it's an appetite, which is a radically different approach. It doesn't sound like that much of a different word, but it really is. An estimate is like how long do we think it's going to take? And however long it takes is however long it takes. And most human beings are terrible estimators. We all are pretty much terrible estimators. So that's why things keep going and going and going and going.

(00:34:21):
We instead have appetites. And our appetite for any individual feature is no more than six weeks. Essentially that's our budget we're willing to spend. I'm only willing to spend six weeks in any feature. So we have to figure out the simplest, most effective version of that to get that done within six weeks and get it done by two people. Now, not everything gets the full six weeks. Some things were like, we have a one week appetite for this. This is not that big of a deal. If we have it, great. If we don't have it, that's fine. We're willing to spend a week on it. Not that it could take a week, because it could also take 12 weeks if we give it 12 and it could take 24, if we give it 24. Work expands to fill the time available. So for us it's about appetite.

(00:35:00):
So the idea of appetites, maxing things out at six weeks, two people max, and then there's a lot of other details, and I could go on for an hour about Shape Up, people can read about it. But it's those fundamental principles, appetites, six week max, small teams and this idea of shaping the work ahead of time, then giving the team a lot of latitude to figure out how to get that thing done. We don't have a spec, we don't create to-dos or tasks or tickets for people. They create the work that needs to get done to fulfill the idea that we've written up and designed essentially, and they figure out how to do it. Then we trade. So they might get into something that we've said, we have about six weeks. Well, we're only give it six weeks and two weeks in they go, we actually stumbled into something we didn't realize.

(00:35:50):
This is probably not going to be able to be done the way we thought. So can we do it this way? And then we have a discussion and there's a conversation. There's a lot of molding and changing that happens along that period of time. We call it trading concessions. There's all the trade-offs we're always thinking about. So all these things that come to bear. And then people often ask, well, what if you don't get it done in the six weeks you gave it? Well, so it depends. So in most cases it should die, meaning it just doesn't happen. Because if we say we're going to give it six weeks and we give it seven or eight or nine or 10, then we're not really giving it six weeks, we're giving it 10, then we don't really have a system.

(00:36:27):
There are times though, when there's a couple days left when we're on what we're calling the downslope. So we have these things in Basecamp called hill charts. And things that are on, that's actually work... A project's more like a hill. It's not like a linear line. If you're on the left side of the hill, it means you're still pushing this thing up the hill. You're still trying to figure out how to do this. But once work gets to the top, it's downhill from there. It's just pure execution and we know how to nail it. So if we're almost at the bottom of the hill on something and it needs two more days, fine. If there's any work that's left over that's still on the left side of the hill, meaning we're still pushing it up, we don't know how we're going to do it and we're at our time limit, it almost certainly dies. So there are some contextual decisions to make at that point, but fundamentally that's how we approach work. And this prevents long running projects that never end, which by the way are the most demoralizing kinds of projects.

(00:37:17):
Things that you're stuck on that you don't want to do that never end, sucks. And if people get stuck on a couple of those, they want to leave their job. So the implications here are significant. And so we want to keep people out of that zone of like, I hate this work and it goes on forever. Because sometimes you're going to hate the work. Not all projects are that exciting. Sometimes it's maintenance stuff, sometimes it's updating an internal billing system that's boring and no customers are going to see but needs to be done. But you'll know that, hey, at maximum we've got four weeks on this. I can already see the end from the beginning, no big deal. But if it's like this is going to take nine months and you're on week four and you're like, I hate this, bad. So we want to stay away from that sort of thing.

Lenny (00:38:00):
You have these quotes along these lines about planning, long-term business planning is a fantasy. I don't plan long-term because I want to do what I think, not what I thought.

Jason Fried (00:38:09):
Yes.

Lenny (00:38:09):
I love these. This whole idea of appetites, it's very appealing. It makes so much sense. It's like the ultimate impact to effort calculation. The effort we'll put into this is fixed and we'll not go beyond this because the impact we expect from this is pretty clear. And if the effort goes up and up and up, well why did we even do this? But obviously the downside is you can't promise things really to sales marketing, which I think makes sense in your type of business. Do you see this work in businesses that aren't your business this approach?

Jason Fried (00:38:43):
Well, let me talk about promises for a second. Promises are the downfall of every business. Every time we've made a promise to get something out in a certain period of time and we kind of inevitably seem to miss it, it's funny how it's almost like it would've been out in time, but the fact that we'd promised it made it not deliver in time. There's some strange thing that happens when you promise things. So we've learned to not promise anything. We can share what we're working on if we want to. We can tell people we're doing something. And by the way, the worst promise, and by the way, we've made a couple of these recently, we always regret them. It's like by the end of the year. That's the one promise you got to be very careful of, because it's so easy to make. There's nothing easier than promising work later.

(00:39:29):
And the further away it is, the easier it is to promise. And so this whole, by the end of the year, oh, red flag. Just remind yourself whenever you say that to yourself, go, oh, wait a second. Wait, wait, what am I doing right now? Because you're probably setting yourself up for disappointment. So as far as other companies running this way, there are a number of other companies that are running this way and more and more are adopting Shape Up all the time. But it's a struggle. It's hard. It's hard to change the way you work. I think companies form roots and roots go in the ground and once your root structure is formed, the plant that grows from that is the plant that grows from that, basically. You kind of have to uproot. And this is not really a totally clear metaphor because that plant is that plant, but you almost have to plant a new seed somewhere else, let's just say, and then grow something new because it's very hard to change in flight and change what you have and change what you're used to.

(00:40:24):
So what we often encourage people to do is keep working the way you're working, but some future project, some low criticality project, try this new method on that. So if it doesn't work, because it's probably not going to work very well the first time, just like if I gave you a guitar and you never played before, it'd be unreasonable for me to expect you to play well. You're going to suck for a while. So go pick some things that don't matter if you suck at them for a while and try this method over there and go, oh, you know what? I'm actually getting quite good. Now let's try to bring this into some more critical stuff. I think that's the important way to approach these sorts of projects, which is to take the criticality out. Because what ends up happening is that when people try to try something new on something really critical and it doesn't work, they'll never try it again.

(00:41:08):
They've destroyed all future opportunities to try this again, because everyone knows how bad it went last time on something that really mattered. And they would've gone, we could have done it our old way. Our old way worked. It kind of sucked, but it worked. And so now you're comparing two things that aren't really comparable, but you're always going to go with the momentum that you had versus the new thing. And so you got to be careful with that. So I know I'm rambling a bit on it, but that's my general sense and feel on how to adopt a different way of working.

Lenny (00:41:36):
There's also this cool down period after one of these, what do you call these? A sprint or what's the term for it?

Jason Fried (00:41:42):
No, I hate that term. I don't like the word sprint because how do you feel after a sprint? Exhausted.

Lenny (00:41:48):
But also pretty good.

Jason Fried (00:41:50):
You can. Yeah, yeah. It's funny because I was a sprinter in high school, so I love sprinting. But if you go all out, you might feel high for a minute, but you can't go all out again. You've got to really catch your breath and you certainly like to sprint. I remember my track coach actually ran in college for a year until I realized that I wasn't good enough. But he made us run 20 200s in a row with just two minutes break in between, and the 200 is an incredibly hard race. You're all out for 200 meters or yards. And after the fifth one I just threw up. I just threw up. It's like that's kind of what work is for a lot of people. It's like 20 200s, they have these sprints and they never seem to end. And there's one sprint after the other, after the other, after the other, after the other.

(00:42:36):
And that's why I don't like the word because you can't layer that back to back to back to back. You cannot sprint back to back, to back, to back in life. And you can't do it at work. People do it at work, but I don't think it actually works. So what we do is after our six week cycles, we typically take what we call a two-week cool down. So we call these cycles, not sprints. A two-week cool down, and we call them cycles because cycles happen again and again and again. Sprints start and end. Cycles happen. There's cycles in life and seasons, and I like that idea that you're prepared for this thing to happen again.

(00:43:12):
Take two weeks, cool down. That's when people can sort of internally freelance. They're still working, but they're kind of tightening up a couple of things. Maybe we just shipped or working on a couple extra days on something that didn't ship that's going to ship in two days, or kind of fixing some bugs and messing around with some stuff that they wanted to get to, but no one ever had time to and was never scheduled. So that's kind a good time to do that. In the meantime, a few of us are shaping up the next cycles projects and finalizing that and writing the pitches up for that. So that's what those cycles are for. It's not that you're stopping work, it's that you're doing other kinds of work. And that I think is replenishing and refreshing, and I think that's the important part versus back to back to back sprints of the same kind of work all the time.

Lenny (00:43:54):
You mentioned also that you have no growth goals, that you make decisions a lot on instinct and gut and opinion, which sounds amazing, it's great if you could pull it off. Feels also very hard to operationalize and maybe make the best decisions in times. Can you just talk about how you actually operationalize that and what you find happens when you approach things that way?

Jason Fried (00:44:15):
I'll just admit that that's the only way I've ever known how to work. I don't know how to make decisions by numbers or I don't find any joy in it, frankly. I've always been intuition driven and gut driven. And frankly, to be honest, I think everyone actually is. And this is part of the thing I want to write up. I've been thinking about writing about this. I think everything's a judgment call. And so yeah, data can play a part. All sorts of things can play a part, but unless you're letting a machine make the decision, that's purely rational. If you're asking a human to make it's a judgment call. They're bringing to bear thousands of things they know and don't know about that influence them about this particular decision. And it's why when companies hire executives, what are they looking for in executive? They typically go judgment and experience.

(00:45:06):
They're not like they can read an Excel spreadsheet. That's not the thing that matters. Anyone can read that or anyone can read a chart or you can learn to do that. They're looking for judgment and experience, which is a very amorphous thing. It's like, what is it really? Well, they've been around, they've seen a lot of things, they've absorbed a lot of experiences and they're going to bring those undescribable things to bear to make decisions for the business. So out of all the things, data might be one thing, but there's thousands of things that go into a decision that many of which you don't even know. And I just feel like I'm comfortable admitting that that I don't really know why I'm making these calls, but I'm making these calls regardless. And I'm not looking at a number and going, if this is fifty-one percent versus forty-nine, I'm going this way for sure.

(00:46:01):
That could be an input perhaps, but it's not the only input. And I think people should recognize that even if you're a data-driven person, there's so much more at play here. So I just feel like just being honest about that and that's sort of how I've always looked at it. And I also will admit, as I just mentioned, I don't know the things that go into my decision-making process, but I'm absolutely fascinated by decision-making. I think it's one of the most interesting human endeavors. And I would just say that give your intuition credit. Give your gut credit. It's absorbed everything. And plus the things that you don't know it absorbed that are valuable.

Lenny (00:46:42):
It's easier to do that if you're the founder running the company, obviously. Is there something you find that you can do to help your teammates approach things that way too? Do you just trust their instincts also in a similar way?

Jason Fried (00:46:54):
Yeah, you're right by the way, it is easy for me to sit up here and say this, I own the place. No one can fire me. I get it, right. I can be wrong all the time, go, my gut just told me to do this. And I understand, I do. I'm self-aware enough to understand that. But I think that by demonstrating that's how we make decisions, it creates space for other people to make decisions that way. And when we have conversations, I'm talking with my team about something, I'll often go, I don't really know. It feels like this. It feels this way. And they'll say, I feel this way. And I'll ask them, how do you feel? How do you feel? What we ask people in general is we say, what do you think? We don't say, what do you know? We often say, what do you think? We might say, what do you know?

(00:47:43):
But we also say, what do you think more time. And what does that mean? What do you think is, I don't know where these thoughts come from and I don't know what forms them. So I think it's interesting to look at the things we say and go, we actually do want people to think. And so I'll often say, what do you think or what do you feel or how does this feel? Is something we talk more about at work than pretty much anything else, which is like, how does this screen feel? How does this flow feel? How does this feature feel? How does this word feel? How does this sentence feel? How does this paragraph feel? How does this website feel? How does these colors feel? Because human beings feel.

(00:48:20):
And while we have a logical side to us and a rational side to us, we're primarily feeling creatures. Even if we don't admit it, we are. And so I'm always curious about that. So I bring that up a lot and I ask other people how they feel, and I think hopefully that encourages people to share that side of their opinion. And we almost never, sometimes we look at numbers to sort of be an input, but it's never prove that. I'll never say justify that. That's just not terminology or lingo that we ever bring up. It's not a way.

(00:49:05):
It's, how do you feel? It's not like, how certain are you? I try to tend to shy away from anything that's about certainty. We're not after certainty. I want to know how you think it feels. So anyway, I'm rambling again, but this is, I'm rambling because this is actually how things go. When we talk, there is a lot of this, it's not precise in a sense. It eventually becomes precise when it's out in the world, but the thought process is very rambling and very amorphous, and you kind of find your way as you go. And eventually go yeah, yeah, that's it. That's it. That feels right.

Lenny (00:49:45):
This kind of advice comes up a lot actually on this podcast, especially for product managers, that there's a lot of power in just trusting your instincts and not just being this kind of unbiased participant in a product team, having actual, here's what I think works from your own experience using the product from your own life experience. But this came up with Brian [inaudible 00:50:05] episode. He's running the company, he's telling everyone basically, here's what we're building. A lot of people said, okay, that'd be great if our CEO is also a designer, very product-minded person. Many people aren't that, many people don't have actual enough experience to have built amazing instincts. So, do you solve that by just hiring people that have a lot of experience? Is it like a hiring thing? Is it trust people that have a lot more experience more because not everyone's going to have the right instinct?

Jason Fried (00:50:34):
It's true. Look, Brian's probably one of the greatest CEOs around today, but I like small businesses. So he knows how to run a bigger organization. I wouldn't. So I can't really step into that answer from that perspective. One of the reasons we stay small, I think, is so we can all rub off on each other. And when we hire, we can be very, very selective because we only hire a few people a year. And so I only hire designers and product people, David hires programmers, and different people in the company hire different people. But when I hire designers, I'm curious about their tastes. I'm curious about what they like. I'm curious about what other products they think are good. I'm curious about what they've seen that they admire or who they... I'm always asking about that because that helps me get a sense of who they are and what lens they see the world through and what kind of influences they're going to bring to bear. So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for.

(00:51:34):
And one of the things that we do during the interview process for designers specifically and product people, which is the same thing in my mind, is they do a project for us at the end. So the last five finalists will do a project for us. We'll pay them to do the project, they'll have a week to do it, they'll do it, and then I'll critique it with them. Even if I love it, I will push back in certain areas. And one of the things I'll often ask is, if you had another couple days, what would you do with this? And I want to see where people go with that. To me, that is where you can see they don't have any time to think. So where does their gut go? What are their instincts? Where do they arrive after having to riff on the spot with something?

(00:52:18):
So what's behind what they built? Because what they built should just be some of what they had in mind. It shouldn't be everything. Now they're exhausted of every future idea. And I've seen some people who we thought were really good, and in that moment, they don't know where to go with it. Now, that's not to say some people don't need time to think and think it through, but I'm still looking for people who just, their gut is filled with ideas. And so it doesn't always translate but that's how I try to suss out whether or not someone has a good gut instinct on where to go. And it almost doesn't necessarily even matter where they go with it because this is raw, just raw gut. But I want to see that they have one and they're willing to lean into it and not be afraid of saying things that may not make any sense.

(00:53:08):
But yeah, I've got some other ideas and we could try this, and we try this, and I kind of play with this idea. And I don't know. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, maybe we try, what if we did that? What about this? And then I would say something and we'd riff and we start riffing. And when we start riffing, there's a synchronicity that I'm looking for. And when I feel that synchronicity and that resonance, the two wavelengths are just perfectly vibrating together, then I know we have something. So that's the kind of stuff I'm looking for when I hire people. And I do think that that translates to people with a better gut feel than someone who's more of a, let's call it an academic product person, which can be very fine at other places, but it wouldn't really work here.

Lenny (00:53:46):
That's really great advice for someone looking for someone that has a good instinct and gut. And I think it's interesting because that's often the opposite, what you described is what many people don't want. Someone with just a ton of ideas. Because a lot of companies, a lot of leaders are like, we got plenty of ideas. We just need you to help us ship stuff.

Jason Fried (00:54:02):
I don't want that either. So I don't want just ideas. So they have to make something that's clear. First of all, it has to be good and clear. And then they also have to be able to riff on the spot and think about how else they could take this. We've had some people who were just so scatterbrained and they've got a million ideas, but when we asked them to execute something for this project, it was a total mess. You could see their time management skills were off and they focused on the wrong things. That is not a go for me, that's a no go.

(00:54:31):
What's a go is that's a clever design, well executed, thoughtful, clear, and here's where they could take it from here on out if they had a few more days, or even if we had 15 minutes, what would you do you do with that? So that's the kind of stuff that I think ultimately is the meat of it. And so I always think of it in terms of play. This is play. I want to play with this product. I want to play with this design. I want to play with this idea. It's play and play is a thing. It's a very clear thing versus a rigid, boring approach to product development, which again, can be successful, but it wouldn't work at our company.

Lenny (00:55:12):
Great clarification. I completely agree.

(00:56:18):
Okay. We had some questions come in from the audience when we were preparing for this. We both tweeted to see what people wanted to ask. I have two that I picked out. One is from Matt Mullenweg. How cool is that?

Jason Fried (00:56:29):
Oh my God.

Lenny (00:56:31):
I think you may have seen this question, but the question is, what is a spectacular failure of someone trying to follow your advice and failing when it doesn't stick? What is the reason?

Jason Fried (00:56:41):
People trying to make a rapid, fundamentally, 180 degree changes quickly is a great way to fall flat on your face, basically. I have seen people who try to adopt, let's say, Shape Up, and they come back six weeks later and they're like, "This sucks. This doesn't work." I'm like, "I'm not surprised to hear that. Tell me how you did it." And then, they explain like, "Oh, the next project we did, we did this." I'm like, "Yeah, I'm really not surprised to hear that now." Because you can't really do that. You can't turn on a dime. There's this thing called momentum. I always try to think of things in terms of the physical world. The more massive an object, the more energy it takes to change its direction. This is why big companies move slowly.

(00:57:26):
This is also why momentum, which is the way you've been working for four years, is going to power you forward in a certain way. It's very hard to turn the corner immediately or turn around. You just cannot do it physically. If you can't do it physically, you can't do it this way. I think that's what I've seen, is these rapid like, "All right, starting tomorrow, we're starting Shape Up." It's like, well, no, it's not going to work. Unless you say we're going to do it on this other thing that doesn't matter so much. That's one thing I would say.

(00:57:52):
The other thing is that pretty much every business is a spectacular failure. It just is. It's like, business is really hard and the ones that make it are all outliers. This is why most businesses fail. There's a million reasons why, and it's always hard to pin it down. And we can all look back. By the way, I don't like to look back on things. I'm not much of a fan of looking back on failures and trying to figure out what went wrong so we don't do it again, because I don't think we know what went wrong. I think we can spend a long time trying to analyze it and we're going to find something that we can agree on, and it tends to be what you can agree on so you can move on. But that doesn't mean that's what it was.

(00:58:37):
Just like we don't really know why you make decisions, you don't really know why things didn't work. Sometimes there are some examples, and I think it's true if you're talking about a mechanistic system. You're stamping metal and it's supposed to have perfect circles and it's an oval. You can go back to that machine and see how the thing worked, and the line. You can adjust that and fix that. A lot of work though is not that way, especially software work, where there's a million different inputs and a million different people. It's not simple stamping machines. It's a different thing. I don't know, but I do think that trying to make big changes too quickly is a primary reason.

Lenny (00:59:13):
You've seen this approach work at traditional companies, I imagine? It's not just companies that work in your way where there's no investors, they're not obsessed with growth? You've seen Shape Up implemented at traditional public type companies?

Jason Fried (00:59:27):
Yeah, it's usually smaller teams. It's not like Airbnb, Brian's not going to go, "Okay, tomorrow, we're following this thing that these guys over 37signals came up with." But it's typically small teams inside larger companies that experiment with this. Sometimes it spreads and sometimes it doesn't, and it doesn't always need to. It could be this one division, this one group that works a different way.

(00:59:45):
Also, it doesn't have to be fully Shape Up. It could be 30% of it. Maybe it's just simply the six-week cycle thing is the thing and the rest of it doesn't matter so much. Or it could be this idea of appetites versus estimates, and they can work that into the way they work. Take whatever works. You don't have to go wholesale on any of these things.

Lenny (01:00:07):
Awesome. A second question comes from Leo Polovets, one of my favorite VCs. He works at Susa Ventures. He asked the question a lot of people actually asked. It's just, what does he think he got right and where has he changed his mind, if anywhere? You share a lot of strong opinions, very contrarian opinions. So, maybe just mostly on that second part is what I'm most curious about. What have you changed your mind about?

Jason Fried (01:00:29):
A few years, well, a handful of years ago, we used to make multiple products, and we went to just doing Basecamp. I thought I would be personally satisfied for the rest of my career, working on one thing and just making that thing the best it could possibly be. Essentially, working on one sculpture, and constantly tweaking it and chiseling it and just polishing it, and just making it better and better, and better, and better, and better. I still thoroughly enjoy working on Basecamp. But a few years ago, we built this new thing called HEY, HEY.com email service, because we just felt like we had to make more things again.

(01:01:04):
This idea that I thought, that we could be happy as a company just doing one thing really well, which was a major shift. We had multiple products. We basically wound those down. We didn't ever close them down. People can still use them, who were using them before, we just stopped selling them. We even changed the name of the business from 37signals to Basecamp. We're saying, we're signaling all through. We're doing one thing that's just this thing called Basecamp. It's a huge, massive decision to make, and so we were all in on it. And then, a few years ago, we go, "You know what? We're makers. Let's be honest about ourselves."

(01:01:39):
I'm talking about me, and I was talking about David. But we were just like, "We want to make more things again. We have some more ideas. Why are we suppressing ourselves? Let's not do that." We made HEY and now we're doing ONCE, and we're going to make more products and more products and more products. We're going to probably do another book, as I mentioned earlier. It was that. I think that's the biggest major fundamental 180 degree change that I've changed my mind on, but I changed my mind all the time.

(01:02:08):
I disagree with myself constantly on small things. Product design decisions or the naming of something, or how we roll something out, or how I'm going to write something or present something or say something. There's probably an answer, I'm sure there's an answer in this podcast that if I listen back, I'd go, "I would probably answered it differently," or, "I don't even agree with the way I answered that." There's a million things like that happening all the time. But in terms of big things, I think that's the best example I can come up with.

Lenny (01:02:33):
It's clear that you've designed your life and designed your business in this very intentional way. Because the default path, and I'll reference this back to this other podcast episode, the default path is, build a company, raise a bunch of money, build massive business, generate a lot of revenue, exit, try something else. And you've done something very different. You've built a company-

Jason Fried (01:02:53):
Can I speak up to that, though?

Lenny (01:02:53):
Please.

Jason Fried (01:02:56):
Because this is the pathless path stuff?

Lenny (01:02:57):
Yeah.

Jason Fried (01:02:57):
Is this what that was? Yeah. I'm moderately familiar with that idea. I didn't listen to that podcast, but I saw some clips. I find it interesting because you've designed your life intentionally. It's funny because there are some principles I hold, perhaps, or some direction I'm headed, but I don't think about any of this ahead of time, including the company. We don't have a multi-year plan. I don't even have a one-year plan. I don't even have a six-month plan or a quarter. We think about everything we're going to do every six weeks. Every six weeks, we rethink what we're going to do next.

(01:03:33):
We're very much an in-the-now company, making it up as we go. And this is true for me, personally, my career, the whole thing. I didn't have any of this planned out. I didn't decide I wanted to be like this or like that. I just figure out what works and keep doing that until it doesn't. And then, maybe we do something else. But it's very much, I'm not on a path. I can't see the path. I'm on a path. We're going somewhere. I don't want to stand still. But I don't know where I'm going, and I'm perfectly comfortable with that.

(01:04:05):
For me, it is really much about making it up as you go, based on, again, being in touch with how things feel to you, what your intuition is, what your gut tells you, what makes you happy. What do you want to do? What can you do? Sometimes, it's things that make you happy and you can't do, just because life is what it is. So, understanding that and figuring out what the trade-offs are. But really, it's figuring out as we go, and I think, frankly, it's the best way to run a business. I think it's the healthiest, most honest way to run a business, which is, to figure it out as you go.

(01:04:37):
I think the further out you plan, the less you know about the decisions you're making. And by the time you get there, you're probably going to be wrong, or you're going to want to do something else. And then, if you're like, "Don't do those things," then what's the point of planning? People end up doing things they don't want to do because they said they were going to do them. Obligations in the future, I think, are quite dangerous, and I think they send people down a path of unhappiness, actually. I think just staying closer to now is probably the best way to do that.

Lenny (01:05:04):
A lot of this trickles down from the biggest decision you made, which is, don't raise money, keep control of this business. You're the boss. There's no boss above you.

Jason Fried (01:05:13):
Yeah, the independence. If you go to 37signals.com, there's 37 ideas. And the first one, there's a 00, which is start here, which is like a read me. But 01 is independence. Independence is the root of all the things we're able to do, and we did make that intentional decision. We didn't know all the tentacles that come up from that and what it's going to impact and touch, but we knew principally, we want to be able to do what we want to do.

(01:05:40):
We want to be entrepreneurs and to me, that means working for yourself. The moment you go out and take money or have these big obligations, you end up working for someone else. I do understand why some companies do it, but I don't understand why a lot of people do it, who probably shouldn't do it. I think staying independent is a wonderfully fulfilling experience, and it's very hard to do when you're beholden to someone else's timeframe and expectations.

(01:06:12):
Another thing we rarely have here are expectations. This is the point. We launch a new product, I don't know what's going to happen. We launched Basecamp, I didn't know what was going to happen. We launched HEY, I didn't know what was going to happen. We're going to launch some new stuff soon, I don't know what's going to happen. We don't say, "If this gets 20,000 users, then it's a success." I don't know. We don't care. It doesn't even matter.

(01:06:33):
We're making it anyway, and we're going to see what's going to happen. The market will tell us what happens. I'll just wait to find out. There's no sense in spending the time thinking about what could be.

Lenny (01:06:43):
Just to push back, I imagine there are expectations of like, "I hope this works out. I hope people adopt it. I hope it becomes the best email client in town." There's a sense of like, "We want this to succeed"?

Jason Fried (01:06:53):
That's pride, though. That's a matter of like, we want to be proud of the work that we did. We really hope people like it, and we want to keep doing it. To me, that's a sense of caring about the work itself. It's not so much about the outcome, which you don't control as much as you might think. Clearly, we want people to accept the work that we do and we want to find enough people who like it to make it sustainable, but I don't have them in mind. This is going to sound selfish, but I have me in mind first. Because if I'm not for me first, it's hard to be for someone else.

(01:07:29):
I'm for us. We want to make things that we're proud of, that we think are really good, that are unique, that brings something new to the world that doesn't exist, otherwise there's no point in doing it. That bring a different perspective that only we can provide because everyone has their own. We want to make sure ours is very visible in the products that we make, which is why we approach things very differently than most, and our products are very different than most. That's why they should be there. We should provide alternatives.

(01:07:56):
As I said earlier, I don't like the word competition, because it almost sounds like you could be making the same thing. I want to provide an alternative, which is a different approach, a different way forward. It could be in pricing. It could be in the way something works. It could be in the flows in the thing. It could be the entire conception of the thing, but it should be an alternative. If it's not an alternative, it doesn't need to exist. Anyway, that's how I think about it.

(01:08:24):
But yeah, there are expectations. Or I should say, maybe it's more like there are desires and hopes of acceptance to some degree, because it needs to. Otherwise, we can't stay in business. But really, it's like, are we proud of it first? We're wrapping up the HEY calendar right now, which is the calendar we're building for our HEY email service. I'm really proud of it. I have no idea what's going to happen. It's very unusual. But I'm really proud of the work that we did, and that's enough for me.

(01:08:47):
I think it's going to do well. I don't know, though, and it doesn't really make any sense to wonder if it will or not. It just, it will or it won't. All I can do is, be proud of the work that we're doing and be proud of the people who are doing it, and feel like we're putting something out in the world that we think should be here. Whether or not people agree is up to them.

Lenny (01:09:05):
You mentioned the principles of the company and I was going to touch on one of these actually. What's the URL to check these out? By the way, we'll link to it in the show notes.

Jason Fried (01:09:11):
Yeah. 37signals.com.

Lenny (01:09:12):
Okay. Right, just the homepage?

Jason Fried (01:09:15):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:16):
Okay. Amazing.

Jason Fried (01:09:16):
Yeah. Yeah. The homepage, yeah.

Lenny (01:09:16):
Okay. One of them is, work isn't war. You wrote a book about this roughly, about Work Doesn't Have to Suck, but I guess, can you just talk about why war work feels like war, and then what maybe people could do to make it feel less like war?

Jason Fried (01:09:29):
This is about words in a lot of ways. I'm not looking at the page right now. I could pull it up and read it, but essentially, a lot of work uses war metaphors. You're targeting customers. You are conquering a market. Gosh, now I really want to make sure I get all these right. Hang on, I'm just going to look this up. Because these things are how people talk about work. It says, "They conquer the market. They capture mindshare. They target customers. They employ a sales force. They hire head hunters. They destroy the competition. They pick battles and they make a killing."

(01:10:10):
That's how people talk about business. I find that to be depressing. It just feels depressing to me. We use words to establish a perspective in a way of thinking about the world. And if those are the words that are in your head, then you feel like it's this war. This is the other thing. People are always like, "What do the Navy SEALs do?" And they're like, "Heck, yeah." That's the Navy SEALs, man. It's not your software business. Why are we always looking to Navy SEALs to tell us how to run our business? "The military, they've got a group of eight and they do these."

(01:10:42):
It's like, "Yeah, okay, that's that context." Can we not look at that for a second about ... That's amazing. What they do is amazing, obviously, but what you're doing is you're making B2B accounting software. Let's just chill for a second here, okay? I like to think of words that are more additive and alternative. " We can exist. Let's exist. Let's make something great." Not, "Let's beat them, let's conquer them, let's make a killing." Let's just make something great. I think that matters, and it changes the way you think about the work that you do.

(01:11:16):
It's more about pride and excitement and a spirit of creation than it is destruction. I think if you go into it with destruction in mind, you're going to end up in a pretty dark place. That's our point of view.

Lenny (01:11:31):
Awesome, I love that. Coming back to this bootstrap path, there's a lot to love about it. Independence, with that trickles down all these things that you're able to do with your company that other companies aren't able to.

(01:11:43):
For someone that's thinking about going down this path and wants to bootstrap their company, that doesn't have a lot of money because it takes cash to start a business, do you have any advice for just how to get started down this path?

Jason Fried (01:11:53):
Yeah. First of all, it's hard. This is hard. When you have nothing, especially, it depends where you are in your life, too. You may have a couple of kids and you don't have a lot of time, and you got to pay mortgage. It's tough, so this is hard, but it's the reality for almost every business in the world that starts. The best advice I could give you is, and this sounds so trite, but really it's true, is, stay as small as you can for as long as you can. The only thing you can really control are your costs. You can't control the alternatives in the market. The competition, you can't control them. You can't determine the market itself. You can't control the economy. You can't control how much advertising costs, but you control your own costs.

(01:12:39):
The other thing I would encourage people to do is, figure out how to do as much as they can on their own before they bring on a second person. Really work and struggle through something on your own. The moment you bring on someone else, you've got another mouth to feed. It becomes expensive. You got another personality to deal with the more you rely on them. And if they turn out to be the wrong person, you have to lose them. You don't have anyone to do the work that now you have them doing, and now you've got to do it. You're not going to be any good at it. You got to start as small as you possibly can and do as much of the work yourself as you possibly can.

(01:13:11):
Keep your costs in check. Don't spend any money on branding. Don't go get an office. Don't spend anything on anything, basically, except the tool you use. Let's say, it's your laptop or whatever you're going to use. Get a good one. They don't cost much anymore. 1,500 bucks or something like that, you can get a really nice MacBook Air or whatever. You need an internet connection and maybe you need a host somewhere or whatever, but use Squarespace to set up your site for 15 bucks a month or whatever. Don't go hire a web designer. Find all the efficiencies and keep your costs incredibly low, and don't make things hard on yourself.

(01:13:47):
This is the other thing that all businesses at every stage need to keep in mind. While it's hard, things are relatively simple until you make them complicated. Simple can also be hard, but complicated is a lot harder. I think Brian Chesky had a really good bit on this, I think, on your podcast about how companies get complicated. And I loved that. When I was hearing it, I kept hearing this unfolding, this complex shape that you almost can't fold back. It's so complicated now that you don't even see where it came from. Now, it is what it is and you can't put it back in the bottle. It's just a mess, right? This happens really quickly and it can happen at a small scale, too. These are a bunch of things, and none of this is to say it's going to work. You could follow all those things and it could just completely fall apart. And it probably will. It's just the reality. I think something we use at 37signals, David taught me this, it's really a stoic thing, which is just the idea of negative visualization. What's the worst that can happen? You got to be at peace with the worst that can happen. Just role-play that and go, "What's the worst?" For example, we're doing these new ONCE products. What's the worst that can happen? Well, the ONCE model is totally different. It's not SaaS. It's you pay once, you download the software. You install on your own server.

(01:15:09):
We're putting a lot of effort into this. This could be the wrong time to do it. It could be a total flop. This could not find any traction on the market. What's the worst that can happen? Well, we spent six months exploring something and having a really good time doing it. Our margins are there, so we can do it. I wouldn't suggest someone does this if they can't afford to do it. But we know this might not work, and we're already at peace with the fact that this might not work. That's, I think, how you ultimately are able to move forward, is to be at peace with knowing what's going to happen if it doesn't work out.

Lenny (01:15:42):
I want to touch on Linear. One, it's interesting that you guys have a lot of similar philosophies. What is it about project management, task management software that creates this sort of approach to business? That's maybe one question, if there's something there.

(01:15:59):
And then, the other is, it feels like they have a lot of similar philosophies. Growth isn't a focus. It's gut and instinct. They have paid work trials. They're profitable. They don't spend a lot of time around VC money.

(01:16:11):
Do you have a feeling like this approach could work in the venture route? And do you see them as maybe an example of like, "Hey, maybe we could adopt a lot of these things and also raise money?" Maybe there's another direction here?

Jason Fried (01:16:22):
Yeah. I can tell you I don't know enough about them to comment on their ... I've heard some about them and it sounds like they have some similar points of view. Where those came from, I don't know. Maybe they materialized out of nowhere. Maybe they picked them up from someone else. Maybe they came up with them themselves. Lots of different ways to work. It's nice to hear that other people are trying some of these things and it's working for them, so that's great.

(01:16:45):
The thing with the VC route, so the idea of having too much money, it doesn't mean you can't work efficiently and thoughtfully. But it does create a degree of sloppiness, because you don't have to. When you don't have to, and when I'm saying have to, you could say have to what? Have to do a whole bunch of things. When you don't have to, we don't have to make money, when you don't have to be efficient, when you don't have to be profitable, you just get sloppy.

(01:17:15):
"Let's hire some more people. Whatever, we can afford to. In fact, they need us to spend the money, by the way. They didn't give us the money to save it and earn 6% interest." Which would be great now. Three years ago, 0% interest. "They didn't give us the money to sit in the bank. They gave us the money to spend the money." What are you going to spend it on? Two things, people and marketing. Basically, that's what you spend it on.

(01:17:36):
We can buy more ads. We can do more of this. We're going to do that. We can hire some more people, build up more teams, do more things simultaneously. There's a certain sloppiness in that. I think it just becomes harder when the environment encourages slop, which is why I think the value in bootstrapping is that it teaches entrepreneurs, it not even teaches, it forces them to have to figure out how to make money. The more time under the curve they have making money and practicing making money, the better at it they're going to get.

(01:18:07):
I used the guitar metaphor a bit earlier, I'll use it again. If you're playing guitar, if I give you a guitar and ask you to go up on stage and play guitar, you're going to suck. It's going to be horribly embarrassing and you're going to be terrible at it. You might be terrible at it a month later, but you'll be slightly better at it. You do it for six months or a year, you're going to be better and better. And then, five years and you're really getting good. Why do we think that a business that is sloppy, that doesn't have to make their own money, that is just getting pumped full of money by somebody else, can all of a sudden turn on the profit spigot and all of a sudden be profitable?

(01:18:36):
What you see is that they oftentimes cannot because they're just not set up to be that way. They've never played guitar before, and now they're being asked to play guitar. The reason I think it's great for entrepreneurs to start bootstrapping is because they just have more practice making money. They get better and better and better at the fundamental skill you need to have ultimately to run a successful business, which is to make money. If you don't have to do that from the start, you're just not practicing that. You're practicing spending money.

(01:19:02):
Getting good at spending money is not a valuable skill as getting good at making money. That's why I think it's just harder. But, of course, it's possible. It's just harder.

Lenny (01:19:10):
What I'm hearing is, essentially, to do this well. You need discipline. Understand, here's the incentives they're driving me to; spend more money, grow faster, and being really good at not ... And then, also, it sounds like you just need investors that are on board with ... "We understand. We're not going to focus on growth obsession. We're not going to focus on getting new teams. We're going to give you space to build it the way you want."

Jason Fried (01:19:33):
That exists. It's just also an outlier in that industry. I think what you need are constraints, is what I'm actually trying to get at. You need constraints. When you have just loads of money, you basically have very few constraints. That's what tends to lead to slop. Versus like, "Hey, if we don't figure this out, we can't make payroll next week or next month." You just start to figure things out. One of the best stories I heard about this was Peter Rahal, who started RXBAR. Are you familiar with RXBAR?

Lenny (01:20:00):
Mm-hmm.

Jason Fried (01:20:01):
Yeah, little protein bars or whatever. There's a great article about this years ago, where he was talking to his dad about, I think, raising money or something. His dad's like, "Hey, go sell 1,000 fucking bars and come back and talk to me." He's like, "Just sell some fucking bar. Get out on the street and sell some bars, man. You've got products? Sell products. Go, sell." Versus all the things you could possibly do. "Go sell some bars." It's just such great advice and it just cuts through all the crap. I like that scrappiness, and you don't get scrappiness from having large S. You just don't. It's just too easy not to have to do anything.

(01:20:46):
Not to say that VC companies aren't doing things. They're doing a lot of things, obviously, but are they honing the scrappy skills? Are they learning how to make money and have margin and be profitable? If they don't have to, they probably are not. I think at some point, and we're starting to see this now, this is not like an I-told-you-so thing, this is just, this is what happens. This is not me. This is just economic cycles. Money's harder to find, it's harder to get. Even companies who've raised money, investors are not necessarily putting in additional rounds. There's deep cuts happening, layoffs, pain and suffering.

(01:21:23):
It's hard to switch from having a lot to not having enough, and then having to work as if you know what to do. I think there's a lot of confusion in the market now, at companies now, I should say, because they don't know what to do. They haven't had to do it before. I feel for them in a sense because, how could they be expected to know what to do? Just frankly, as I said earlier, if someone dropped 10 million bucks on me and 1,000 people, I would have no idea what to do with that. Truly, I would not. I would waste it is what I would do. If you don't have the experience, how are you going to know?

Lenny (01:22:00):
I'm the same way with the newsletter and the podcast. There's no way I can grow this thing with money, really. I've tried a bunch of little experiments and nothing really does anything. It actually comes back to, let me find this quote that you have of just your business strategy in a nutshell. "Just keep making great shit. Keep your cost in check. Charge appropriate prices for your work. Share as much as you can and let the chips fall where they may."

Jason Fried (01:22:22):
That's basically it. One of the things I don't think I said in there was, enjoy it. Have fun. Enjoy the ride. Love who you're working with and create a great environment to do great work, and so other people can do great work and thrive as well. That's all baked into that. It's not like, set targets. It's not, try to be a billion-dollar business. It's not, aim for an exit. It's not, be on the cover of whatever. It's not many of those things.

(01:22:52):
Maybe it's the Midwesterness in me, growing up in Chicago. I don't know. It's just that. The best business advice I ever got, I got from my dad. It's just a simple line. It's like, "No one ever went broke making a profit." And maybe that's just my guiding light, ultimately. It's like, because you can go broke generating a lot of revenue. A lot of companies do. But you can't go broke generating a profit, and I think it's just really tight.

Lenny (01:23:18):
What a great quote. Final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Let's talk about ONCE. This is a new product/umbrella of products you're developing. Can you just talk about the thinking here? And then, I think you guys are announcing the actual first product within this umbrella?

Jason Fried (01:23:32):
Yeah. The idea behind ONCE is, David and I feel like, we're probably a bit early here, but we feel like there's going to be a bit of a turn back towards the way things were. Pendulums always swing. And for the last decade or so, SaaS has been pretty much the only way to run business software. Basically, you rent it. There's really not a lot of alternatives. You rent software. We think that there's subscription fatigue and also some benefits to that, for sure, but there's also a lot of downsides just to ...

Jason Fried (01:24:00):
... that, for sure, but there's also a lot of downsides to subscription software. You keep paying the same amount every month for the thing that you had last month. It's not like a magazine where every month you get literally a new issue. So that's new. I'm paying for new weekly or monthly, okay, that makes sense. I mean, I know there's new stuff that comes out in software products but let's face it, the core of the thing that you're using, 90% of the time is the thing you've been paying for four years now, every month. It just seems like, nah. So we are going to launch this thing called Once, which is essentially a brand and umbrella, a line, a product line of non-SaaS products, of products, not services, things people will download, software business offer products, people will download, pay for once and then install on their own server or a shared server or in the cloud, their own cloud or whatever.

(01:24:53):
But they'll run it, they'll manage it, they'll pay for it once and there's no subscription fees, no recurring fees. They get updates, they get support and some of that stuff, but that's it. And so we're going to launch the first one shortly here and then we plan on doing, hopefully, maybe three more next year. And the beauty of these things is that what we're basically doing is we're going out in the market and looking at it, although we already know it because we've been in this world. But we're saying, what are the commodities out there? There are a lot of commodities in business software and there's like 50 alternatives and they're kind of all sort of the same yet they're all still charging luxury prices. In my opinion, if you're paying tens or hundreds of dollars a month or in some cases, thousands of dollars a month, month after month after month after month after month for when there's hundreds of alternatives and there's no price differentiation really between them, that's an opportunity. In every other industry, there's generic peanut butter, there's generic pencils, there's generic everything in a sense.

(01:25:50):
So we're out there looking for commodities that are still charging luxury prices that we can create really beautifully tight, simple, essential generics of very high quality that don't do everything that the other products do, but get the core of it right, the 80-20, we get that right at a high degree of quality. And we can build these in typically three months each with two people. And the maintenance cost is zero to us, essentially. There's no marginal cost here because we make the software and we sell it and we don't have to maintain it in terms of hosting and the whole thing, which is what the expensive part of SaaS is. So anyway, that's the idea behind Once. And we, again, don't know what the market's going to think. I have no idea but we're really excited about trying this and seeing what happens.

Lenny (01:26:33):
And then could you talk about the first thing you're launching or is that not out?

Jason Fried (01:26:37):
Yeah, sure. The first product we're going to be launching is basically an old product that we made way, way, way back when. So years and years and years ago, 2006, we launched a product called Campfire, which was-

Lenny (01:26:38):
Oh, of course.

Jason Fried (01:26:50):
... a group chat tool.

Lenny (01:26:51):
How could you not remember Campfire?

Jason Fried (01:26:53):
Well, some people are-

Lenny (01:26:55):
Are younger.

Jason Fried (01:26:55):
... 22 and they don't know, understandably so. But if you've been around, maybe you remember Campfire, which was a group chat tool, which is I think eight years before Slack came out or something like that. So it was really early and it was really hard to get people to even understand what this thing was, and a lot of people didn't get it. And then Slack came out, of course, and steamrolled it and really, really executed beautifully and did a great job. But chat has become a commodity. There are a million ways to chat with people now, and in the business realm, they're all still quite expensive and they're all month to month to month. You got Slack, you got Teams, and you've got a few others and it's like, you know what... And there are some open-source alternatives, by the way, that are free or cheap. But we want to put something back out there.

(01:27:41):
So we're going to relaunch Campfire under the Once brand. You'll pay for it once, you'll install on your own servers, and you'll run it. And it'll do 90% of the things that you want to do every day and these other chat tools and do them very, very well and very, very simply and very, very easily. And we think it's going to be really interesting. And by the way, the other thing we're thinking about with these Once products, which is interesting, just get to this alternative point of view, is that these don't necessarily need to replace things. They can be in addition to. You might still run Slack at your company but you want to back up for when Slack goes down, or you want a special air-gapped chat for your executive team that cannot be leaked by another company where you're hosting data or having other people involved that might have access to it by accident.

(01:28:34):
You can run things, you can have different tools doing similar things but for different groups in different contexts. Now, you probably wouldn't want to pay month to month to month to month to month for a backup system when something almost never goes down, but if you only have to pay for it once, it might be really... that's a good thing to have. That's an insurance policy to pay for it once and we just have it in our back pocket. The other thing we're doing with Once product is that you get the code. And so if you're a product team and you're curious to see how this product was built, and we've gone to great lengths to make it exceptionally well-built for this purpose, this is a book, essentially, of how to build this kind of thing really, really, really well on the CSS on the HTML and the Ruby on Rails side, for example.

(01:29:18):
So you'll get all the code and you can look at it and you can modify it, you can play with it and you can tweak it. You can't resell it. There's a certain licensing but it's yours. And so if you want to change the layout, go ahead. If you want to add some features, go ahead. If you want to mess around, go ahead, it's yours. And that's another thing that's really novel. You don't get that in subscription software. So there's a lot of things going on that we're trying. There's some other really cool stuff. I'll tell you, one more quick thing about it is that we're trying to make this first prompt especially have as few words as possible, maybe 30 words. So we're picking tools that are... or picking categories that people already know how to use, and so we're trying to keep as many words out of this as possible so it's instantly essentially available for the entire world.

(01:30:05):
It doesn't have to be localized. It's just like, it's universal software. We're trying to think about it this way. And when we do have a word, we're going to have a panel that shows that translation in a bunch of different languages. So it's not like you install this pack or that pack, it's like, you can hit this because different people in the world work in different countries. So we have people in different countries that work for us. I don't want to just have the Indian version because people in India might also have people that work in Brazil and they need the Portuguese version. So you can see all the different languages for certain words when we use them, which is a really novel thing.

(01:30:34):
We're kind of playing, this is the whole thing like, these tools give us a chance to play and explore new realms and new ideas that we couldn't do with SaaS. This is one of the things I'm getting back to the first question you asked me, I think, or maybe it wasn't the first, but this is why I'm excited again. There's some novelty again, there's some new explorations again. We're able to do things that we couldn't do in other places. So there's an excitement that's building around this creative exploration again, and that's really firing us up.

Lenny (01:31:03):
It's clear how you're excited about this. You're saying how you thought you'd be happy just building Basecamp for the rest of your life, and clearly, there's a pull here, I'm going to try something totally new and different. Also, the domain is awesome, Once.com, right?

Jason Fried (01:31:14):
Yeah, that was fun. And we're still going to do Basecamp in here. So we're still doing SaaS. I still believe in SaaS. This is not going to replace SaaS but there should be an alternative. People should be able to buy what they need versus rent what they need.

Lenny (01:31:27):
I think this is going to be an interesting experiment because this is how we started with software and then SaaS came and everyone loved this idea of, I don't have to worry about anything. I'm just going to pay you monthly and you take care of maintenance and hosting all that stuff and keep updating me with better features. So I think it'll be interesting to see if we've missed something leaving that world. One clarifying question, for updates, do you buy yearly, like a new Campfire every year, or how does that work if there's updates?

Jason Fried (01:31:54):
So the plan is, is that let's say you buy Campfire 1.0, this is the way software used to work. It's the same approach, which is like, you'll get all the 1.X updates for free. And you'll be able to decide if you want to update yours or not. So we'll say, hey, 1.1 is out and here are the new things and you get to decide if you want to download that and update yours or not. So you can stick with 1.0 if you want or you can skip a version, whatever you want to do.

(01:32:19):
If when we get to version 2.0, there'd probably be... you'd probably have to buy it again, but we'd probably have a discounted upgrade rate. But that's like, you also totally optional. I don't know if we'll ever even get there. We might not need to. Have no clue. But we're leaving that door open that if there's a radically new version that we had to sink another six or eight months into or something, it feels right to say you'll need to upgrade. Maybe you get half off because you're a previous customer or something like that. So we don't know but that's the plan.

Lenny (01:32:49):
I think it's also important for people to remember your target is not to replace Slack at big tech companies, like your market is the Fortune 5 million as you described.

Jason Fried (01:33:00):
First of all, we don't have a sales team, so it's self-service, it'll always be. If some big huge company says... they look at their bill, their Slack bill and they're going, we're paying 1.2 million a year for this? Wait, wait a second, I can pay less than 1,000 bucks once for this. Maybe that's worth having, or maybe even if we don't use it, it's absolutely worth buying because maybe we will use it, or maybe we can experiment with it in this place. One of the things we're trying to do here is find a price point and it's going to be under 1,000 bucks. I won't tell you exactly where, but we're trying to find a price point where it's kind of becomes a no-brainer, like, you know what? We should buy this, we should have, this should be in our toolkit, and we should use this in certain parts of our business even if we don't replace this other thing, although we still might because we might find that as this group or these two groups or three groups that are using this are making exactly the same progress, why are we spending all this money elsewhere?

(01:33:53):
So it's a bit of a Trojan horse, potentially. I don't know what's going to happen. No idea, but it's going to be pretty interesting. The other thing that's really cool about it, this is the tiniest market in the world, but because it doesn't go out to the internet, you can run it in truly air-gapped research facilities. There was a time way back in the day where the White House got in touch with us. This is when Obama was running and wanted to use Basecamp. But they're like, we need to install it because we can't obviously host this stuff on your servers. I know, I totally get it. We can't do that, unfortunately. Sorry. But they have security needs that are just far beyond what most things allow, but this is the kind of thing where they can actually be completely detached from the public internet and run this kind of software, which is really interesting. Again, tiny market, not what we're building it for, but it's a cool byproduct or side effect, I should say, of running things this way.

Lenny (01:34:49):
And then did you share when this might come out? I know you don't promise dates but is there something you want to share there or is it-

Jason Fried (01:34:54):
Well, unfortunately, we promised. We said by the end of this year, that's why I was getting to that. But we said by the end of 2023, and we're almost there, here we are in December, so mid-December, we're going to start to roll this out to the first batch of customers. It's probably not going to be available publicly to everyone in the world yet, but that'll come soon after. But the first batch of customers are going to get it and we'll slow-roll it out, figure out what we missed, what we need to tighten up and tweak. It's not really a beta as much as it's just a limited release, which is the smart way to do this, and then we'll open the doors very, very soon after that.

Lenny (01:35:30):
Jason, you're breaking your own rule of not saying by end of the year. Apparently, I learned earlier that that's never works.

Jason Fried (01:35:37):
Yeah, it's funny, we definitely said that and we said that six months ago and here we are, end of the year.

Lenny (01:35:45):
It's happening. So maybe sometimes it works out.

Jason Fried (01:35:47):
Yep.

Lenny (01:35:48):
Before we get to our very exciting lighting round, is there anything else that you wanted to share, touch on, or leave listeners with?

Jason Fried (01:35:55):
I think one of the most important things though to remember, and I got to it in another answer, is just like, humans tend to complicate things, and a lot of things are hard but they're still simple until you make them complicated. And just keep that in mind that you can make a lot of progress with two people, and you can do a lot of great work four weeks at a time max, and you can figure things out as you go, and you don't need to know exactly where you're going, and you can be profitable business, and you can find customers who are willing to pay for things. These are all possible things to do. And you don't need to be a big huge company to be successful. And you don't need to be a big huge company to make significant amounts of money. You don't need to do that.

(01:36:42):
You don't need to raise money. So it's like, all those things make things more complicated, actually. Some people think they might make them simpler, if I have a bunch of money, it's simpler. It's actually not simpler, it's harder. In a sense, the more... because those things come with expectations and again, they erase your scrappiness, and there are side effects here. Those things come with very, very thick and strong strings attached. And you got to think about what are those strings attach to and what do they prevent you from doing? You don't have a full range of motion anymore. So I'll leave people with that, even if I touched on some of those ideas earlier on.

Lenny (01:37:21):
And that's a really great way to summarize it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jason Fried (01:37:27):
Let's do it.

Lenny (01:37:29):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jason Fried (01:37:33):
The first one is this book here, so Several Short Sentences About Writing. Do you know this book?

Lenny (01:37:38):
I love that book. I have it on my coffee table.

Jason Fried (01:37:42):
When anyone ever asks me, what book do you recommend on writing? It's this one, Several Short Sentences About Writing. I can never pronounce his last name, but Verlyn Klinkenborg, I believe is his name, although I might be bastardizing that. But it's an extraordinarily good book about writing and it's all about the sentence, beautifully written, fun to read, really great. The other one is pretty much anything by Derek Sivers, but specifically, Hell Yeah Or No. I recommend this book to everybody. It's really had a big effect on me and David, specifically. We use this term, hell or no, all the time internally. Is this a hell yeah or no? It really clarifies a lot of things. And the last one is this design book, which is interesting. There's a few different versions of it. The one I have handy, it's called Home-made: Contemporary RussianFolk Artifacts.

(01:38:35):
And what this book is, it's a collection of... it's a beautiful book. It's very simple. Basically, every spread is a person, a story, and a thing that they had to make because they didn't have anything. They couldn't buy what they needed. They didn't have what they needed. So this example here is a guy put a hole in a spoon to make bubbles for his kid, to blow bubbles, large bubbles. This is a TV antenna made out of forks, and it's just like, getting back to the scrappiness, I admire this kind of ingenuity among or over pretty much anything. And I think that this book is full. There's a couple hundred pages. They have a couple different editions of this, but I love this one a lot. Look at this one. This guy had to make a door handle. I mean, in America, we're like, go get a door handle at Home Depot.

(01:39:28):
This guy didn't have a door handle, so he made it out of a plastic, looks like a gallon oil can or some water thing, and nailed it to a book, which nailed it to a door. Amazing. And this is also why I've always loved... I know this isn't very lightning, sorry but I've always loved looking at jailhouse creations and tools and how people make weapons out of combs and pens. It's just, I find this like, I have nothing, I need something, I can use my human brain to figure out how to make it. I think that scrappiness is beautiful.

Lenny (01:40:03):
Yeah, I was just going to say it speaks clearly to your scrappy mentality. And what is that book called again?

Jason Fried (01:40:10):
This one's called Home-made: Contemporary RussianFolk Artifacts. And there's also an Eastern European one and there's another one too, but Home-made.

Lenny (01:40:18):
What an awesome, unusual selection. Okay, next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jason Fried (01:40:24):
I don't watch TV. I rarely get a chance to see movies these days. I really thoroughly enjoyed Oppenheimer though. I mean, I went to the theater to see it, and seeing that in the theater was really special, but I just love the movie, is fantastic.

Lenny (01:40:41):
Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you are interviewing to hire?

Jason Fried (01:40:46):
I think we actually went over this one a little bit, which was, I'm always curious about what else... if you had more time, what would you do with this idea? Another one is, whose work do you admire? So it's not so much about what you can do, but what are other people doing that you think is great? I find that, that really illuminates what kind of pulse they have on the world and what they're looking at and what inspires them and what they think is good. So I like that question.

Lenny (01:41:12):
In that second question, what do you look for? Is it someone that you also admire?

Jason Fried (01:41:16):
Ultimately, in the moment, I don't care who it is. It's more about, tell me why. So someone will say, I like so-and-so, I'm like, why do you like them? What are they doing that you think is interesting? This is kind of the thing I tend to always ask, which is, why do you think that that's interesting? I'm always trying to get behind the words and understand where this is coming from because people can prepare answers and they can sound great. But it's like, well, what's behind that? Where are you going with that? Why? What's the genesis of this? That's what I'm always after. And so whether or not I agree with the work or whatever, in the end, it plays a part to some degree but I'm more interested in, how did you get there?

Lenny (01:42:01):
Is there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?

Jason Fried (01:42:06):
Yes, although it's more of a category. I bought an old car, and I've fallen back in love with stick shifts. I learned how to stick, and then I basically have had automatic cars for many years and I got back into sticks. And now it's even deeper than that. I got back into the old analog driving experience and how wonderful it is to feel attached to the machine that you're using, that you turn the wheel and it turns it rod and it turns the wheels, and that your leg muscle actually is what's breaking the car, to some degree. There's something about that direct feel that really surprised me. It surprised me how much is missing in modern cars and it actually... I like to draw these parallels because this is how I see the world. It reminded me of our business, actually. I think we have a very stick shift business.

(01:43:06):
We have a very direct business. Everything's very, very tight, very straightforward. There are not a lot of layers of abstractions. There are not a lot of things in the middle between the work we do and the way it feels, and I think of large businesses as automatic transmissions and modern cars where you just... everything's simulated. You don't really know what the road feels like. You can't really feel it in the steering wheel, or maybe there's some fake feel in there now. The brakes are just sending a command to a computer to squeeze the pads. The transmission is like, you don't control it, it just does its own thing. And there's a beauty in that too, but there's also a disconnect that I forgot about until I got back into driving the old car, which is harder to drive and noisier and bumpier and creakier, but there's a real directness to it that's really special, and I think it's actually a good way to look at business and to remind yourself that staying as connected to the thing that you're doing as possible has a lot of value.

Lenny (01:44:11):
That's an awesome metaphor. Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?

Jason Fried (01:44:21):
And I don't always live up to it, but basically, it's worry less. There's a great Tom Petty lyric. I can't remember which song it's in, but I think it's on Wildflowers on the album. Most of the things you worry about never happened anyway. And it's just so true. I find myself worrying about all sorts of things that don't matter and never happen, and then you're like, God, I spent three days worrying about that, or I went to this appointment and it was fine. The amount of worry, and it's just all in your head, and it's all about anticipating the future that hasn't happened yet, and I try to tell myself that, and I try to tell others that in business. I try to tell myself that in life and in business, but also, I tell others that in business, what if people don't like... I don't know. You'll find out. Worry less about it. It probably isn't going to be a big deal anyway. So that's what I would say.

Lenny (01:45:12):
Worry less.

Jason Fried (01:45:13):
Worry less.

Lenny (01:45:14):
Final question, I was going to ask you this before you mentioned this, but you said you're writing a new book, potentially, are you able to share what this new book might be about?

Jason Fried (01:45:22):
We haven't started writing it. I can tell you, or I'm thinking about it, and it's going to revolve around the idea of gut and intuition in business and decision-making. I don't really know exactly how they all play in here in a book, but I think we need to celebrate gut and intuition more in business. And most business books are not about that. They're about the opposite in many ways. Whatever, you can't improve what you can't measure, or whatever these things are. And I think that's true in a lot of realms, like medicine, you can look at your biomarkers and you can do things.

(01:45:59):
I don't think things are quite as direct in business, and I think that intuition and gut is something to be celebrated. So I think what we're probably going to end up doing is looking at all the ways we use intuition and gut to make decisions at work, whether it's hiring or product decisions or policy decisions or whatever it is. Maybe break down some of those decisions in the past, perhaps, or talk about things on a day-to-day basis about how we employ those tools to move forward. So that's roughly the idea. It's very loose right now but hopefully, we can tighten it up and that's what I'd love to focus on that next.

Lenny (01:46:30):
That's an awesome topic for a book. I was thinking Worry Less could also be an awesome title for a book, if that's another topic-

Jason Fried (01:46:35):
That'd be a great title for a book-

Lenny (01:46:36):
... to go down.

Jason Fried (01:46:37):
Yeah, that would be.

Lenny (01:46:39):
I'm reading Charlie Munger's Poor Charlie Almanack right now.

Jason Fried (01:46:42):
Oh, beautiful.

Lenny (01:46:43):
There's a whole thing around the way we misjudge and make mistakes with our psychology, just like a heuristic [inaudible 01:46:50].

Jason Fried (01:46:49):
Human misjudgment.

Lenny (01:46:51):
Exactly. And I feel like that would be a part of this story of gut instinct are often right, but here's ways that we are often wrong, so maybe that's something to think about.

Jason Fried (01:47:00):
Yeah, it's funny. I had one opportunity to meet with Charlie Munger.

Lenny (01:47:03):
Oh, wow.

Jason Fried (01:47:04):
It was on a Zoom call, and it was four of us, and we got an hour with him.

Lenny (01:47:04):
Wow.

Jason Fried (01:47:09):
This was a few years ago. And I only asked him one question. I was mostly just a student listening to other people's questions. I said, what's your take on doing something well that you know nothing about? Essentially, is there power in being completely ignorant about something? I didn't add this but I've often found myself more creative when I don't know how to do something versus like, well, this is how you're supposed to do it, so you fall into this pattern. And I really loved his answer, which was, "I would just... trust your instinct on that," which is like, a lot of great things happen because you don't know how to do them.

(01:47:47):
In fact, a lot of innovations happen because you don't know how other people do them, and all you have is your gut. All you have is your intuition. All you have is how you feel about the thing. You don't have evidence, you don't have other examples to follow. You don't have a list of what to do. You just do. And I'm paraphrasing here. But it gave me a lot of confidence and hope to continue to follow our gut. And maybe this is, ultimately, in a way, what was the seed for this book perhaps, although I hadn't really thought about that until now. But it's a beautiful thing to read and to listen to him speak. I love it.

Lenny (01:48:29):
Jason, we covered everything I was hoping we'd cover. Thank you so much for making the time for this. Two final questions. Folks want to follow up and maybe ask more questions. How can they reach you if they can? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Fried (01:48:42):
So you can hit me up on X, Jason Fried, F-R-I-E-D. I'm on LinkedIn as well, and you can also email me directly, just Jason@hey, H-E-Y.com. So hit me up there. How can people help me? I mean, if you like what we're doing, spread the word. We don't really spend any money on advertising and marketing. We've explored a little bit here and there but most of our growth has been organic, and it's just word of mouth. So if you like what we're doing, tell people about it because it really helps us out.

Lenny (01:49:09):
Amazing. Jason, thank you so much for being here.

Jason Fried (01:49:11):
Thanks, Lenny. It was great.

# We replaced our sales team with 20 AI agents—here’s what happened next | Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)

## Transcript

Jason Lemkin (00:00:00):
Here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B, we're solving problems. Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition, I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. I've even got a special discount for the end of this month, and let me just help you. I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I've explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house. There's only Superchargers. I got you, don't I? That's the job of SaaS and sales because we're not selling commodities.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Today, my guest is Jason Lemkin. Jason created and runs Saastr, the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B founders. He also runs two of the biggest town conferences every year, one in the Bay Area, which attracts over 15,000 people, and one in Europe with over 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs. Before Saastr, Jason was the CEO and co-founder of EchoSign, which he grew to over 100 million ARR and then sold to Adobe where he ended up as a vice president of their web services business. If you follow Jason on Twitter or LinkedIn, you know how much wisdom he has to share about all aspects of building a successful SaaS business. 

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, we focus on what I find most product leaders have the least experience in, building a sales team. We get very practical and tactical on how long you should wait to hire your first salesperson, what your one to two first hire should look like, why you should actually hire two salespeople, not just one initially, how to comp them, how to interview them, when it's time to hire a VP of sales, how to avoid your salespeople flaming out and burning through all your cash. We also get into how to make the product and sales relationship healthier, including how to push back on sales and feature requests, why your head of product should be super involved in your sales process, how long you should make your trials, why you should avoid annual contracts, and so much more.

(00:02:09):
Jason also shares advice for running a conference, which I found super interesting. This episode went long because I just couldn't stop asking Jason questions, but as a result, I'm excited to bring you this incredibly rich episode on building your sales team. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. This helps tremendously and I really appreciate it. With that, I bring you Jason Lemkin after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:02:36):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product popups really annoying, "Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature." These popups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. 

(00:03:10):
They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. 

(00:03:59):

Jason Lemkin (00:05:03):
Hey, I'm so excited. Long time. What's the expression? Long time fan, first time dialer or something?

Lenny (00:05:03):
Caller? 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:09):
First time caller, yeah, first time caller. 

Lenny (00:05:10):
First time guest. 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:11):
I don't know if that exists in 2024 or not, but yeah, that's me. So thank you so much for letting me come.

Lenny (00:05:16):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I feel like you're the kind of guy that I knew would be on this podcast eventually, and I'm glad that we're finally doing this. I also feel like we can go in so many directions. I feel like you have so many insights on so many parts of building a business, especially a B2B business, but I thought it would be most interesting to dive deep into building your sales team, essentially trying to help people figure out how to start their sales team, scale their sales team, and all the elements they go into it. How does that sound?

Jason Lemkin (00:05:46):
I think it's great. I think it's an evergreen topic, but I think there's remains a consistent set of confusion, fears around how to build a sales team, and it's evergreen. The tools change and the pace has changed, but the issues, I love to dig into them because we keep making the same mistakes as founders and executives again and again and again.

Lenny (00:06:09):
100% agree. It's such a black box to me. Sales, I've never done sales, and I'm always just like, "I have no idea what's going on here." So this is how I learned from folks like you. You touched on this now. Now, I wasn't going to get on this, but I think it'd be interesting just this question of, does everyone need a sales team? Will you need a sales team if you're listening as a founder? Is it simply, if you're a B2B business, you'll need a sales team? How should people think about, "Will I need a sales team?"

Jason Lemkin (00:06:34):
If you truly build a self-serve product, you can either never have a sales team or Slack defer it or Canva really defer it. Canva didn't really build a sales team until they were well north of 500 million in revenue because it's epic self-serve. Slack started all self-serve, and by the time they went public, the majority of their revenue was enterprise sales. So you can sequence things. You can have hybrid models like a third of Asana's revenue is still from self-serve, and two-thirds are from a self-serve motion. So there's all different hybrid things. 

(00:07:06):
The most important thing though I've found is however you get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, be honest, be honest, and if you've talked to them as a founder and you know that they need a sales type motion, they need effort to deploy it, they have questions about security, they have questions about competition, they have onboarding requirements, and you say, "Hey, I don't like sales, so I'm going to do a PLG motion," you'll fail.

(00:07:34):
One of the things that I've done with so many founders over the years, and it shocks them at first, is your first 10, 15, 50 unaffiliated customers, the ones that find you from the ether, they're the next 50, 100, 200, 1,000, and you can either embrace them or run for them. Too many producty founders find that, "Hey, gosh, I'm going to have to do sales," and they exit it. They exit it. 

(00:08:00):
I'll tell you a company I invested in 18 months ago when things were easier, maybe 20 months ago, they were doing 5 million in revenue, growing over 100% with the sales like motion. Things got harder, things got harder as they did for many of us, and they decided to fire the whole sales team, and now they're doing less than one from 5 million with beloved customers. If I told you the logos, your jaw would drop. Over 5,000 20 months ago to 1 million today because they fired the sales team because the founders didn't like sales, they thought it was icky, they didn't want to do it, they were tired of doing it. I can tell you several stories like this. 

(00:08:34):
So you've got to be honest about the ... Sometimes we get it just right on day zero. Sometimes we know exactly how our company is going to work or Lenny's podcast is going to work. We can predict the future perfectly, but I find in B2B, a lot of times the industry, we end up winning. The segment of the industry, the type of customer is not what we initially thought and either lean into it and be a success or run from it because sales is icky and risk failure.

Lenny (00:09:00):
When you talk about being honest, what you need to be honest about is that you need sales help to close customers?

Jason Lemkin (00:09:07):
Be honest about that. Just be honest about, yes, the motion that it will take to get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, and if they were able to find you by putting their credit card and no one had to talk to them, then that's your DNA today. It doesn't mean you won't go up market later like a Slack or a Canva, but if you can get them all to do that and you never have to talk to them, then get really good at viral loops, get really good at almost B2C type motions, get really good at this kind of stuff and hire growth hackers and do the whole almost B2C-ish motion, which we have at self-serve, but if your first 10 customers come in and say, "You know what, Lenny, I'll pay you $5,000, but you've got to solve this problem I have with online video," that is not a self-serve motion. It is not a self-serve motion.

(00:09:51):
Even worse, sometimes worse is your first 10 customers, five of them sign up online, but it takes a huge amount of effort for 19 bucks a month, and then five say they'll pay you $5,000 a month. Some founders are like, "I'm going to work on the five that pay us 20 bucks a month, not the five that'll pay us $5,000 a year." I find too many folks that don't like sales, too many folks that have not had any life experience in a sales-led environment flee from those customers, and I've never seen that lead to success. We're surprised who our niche is sometimes. We talk about nailing our niche, but sometimes we're surprised that niche that finds us.

Lenny (00:10:28):
There's a lot of startups I've invested in that start off product-led growth and quickly realized, "This just isn't working," and many of them move to, "We need to actually hire salespeople and start to go top down."

Jason Lemkin (00:10:40):
Most companies are a hybrid. Even there's weird hybrids like there's folks like Mongo and Snowflake. Mongo has, well, maybe Mongo's much better example, Mongo has a free low end version, and there's open source too. It's a little confusing, and then there's not a lot in the middle, and then there's a lot of big. There's all different ways to combine a product-led or self-serve motion with sales-led. Too many founders in the beginning think it's either or. It's not either or. 

Lenny (00:11:06):
So I think the big takeaway here is sales is not a question of if you're going to need a sales team, it's a matter of when. The Canva example is crazy. Maybe that's the [inaudible 00:11:16]

Jason Lemkin (00:11:16):
But they still have one. But they still have one now. 

Lenny (00:11:18):
They still have one. I think Notion, I think at 10 million ARRs when they hired their first salesperson.

Jason Lemkin (00:11:23):
That makes sense.

Lenny (00:11:23):
So I think the question that leads to is, what is a sign that you should start to hire your first salesperson?

Jason Lemkin (00:11:31):
Even if you hate sales, even if you think it's icky, even if you don't like it, as a founder you've, 95 times out of 100, you've got to find a way at least to close the first 10 customers yourself. You've got to find a way. We could dig into how to do that if you don't like sales. The hack though is that even if you don't like sales, customers love to talk to the CEO. The customers love it. Here's the other thing, as a founder, you're really good at the product in the market, hopefully even in the early days. So what's important is even if you don't know how to do outbound, even if you don't know how to send a cold email, even if you don't how to do any of this stuff, and even if you don't know how to ask for a check, even if you don't know how to open or close, almost all founders are A+ middlers, A+ middlers, A+ middlers. Before we started, you and I talked about podcasts and content, and immediately it was an A+ conversation. Maybe you don't know how to close a big sponsor, I'm just making that up, and maybe you don't know how to find one, but once you have someone in your spider web, letting the conversation, you and I just had was A+, and any founder should be there by day one, by day one, and prospects love it. 

(00:12:40):
If I want to buy CRM, I don't get to talk to Yamini at HubSpot or Marc Benioff, but I get to talk to you and your CRM company. It's magical for early adopters. So bear in mind, no matter how bad you think you are as a founder, you're pretty good at the middle part of sales. So find a way to get any prospects, get really good at the middle, and then work up your courage. Work up your courage, and find how to ask for next steps and money. What would it take, Lenny? How can we get going on Riverside? What would it take? We would love to have you. What would it take to get you going next week? You've got to learn that little motion, but you don't have to learn all the stuff you think is smarmy other than how to go from middle to just ask for how we can get going.

Lenny (00:13:19):
I like this term, middlers. So just to make sure I understand what that means, in the middle of the conversation, you're not great at initiating, you're not great at closing, but you could talk about it.

Jason Lemkin (00:13:27):
Yeah, and this is where sales reps are terrible. Most sales reps, once you go beyond the five basic questions, they can't tell you how a database works or how to eliminate hallucinations from your product or how to do payroll in Eastern Southern Guam. The sales rep, and we can talk about this, they need help. They need help from the founders in the early days. They need help from sales engineers or product people, which is my favorite place to get the help as you scale, but they need help. 

(00:13:56):
The beauty to founders is they don't need help in the middle. You can be 10 times better in the middle than any sales rep at your bigger competitor. If you're running, I am just making up CRM, but if you're running a new CRM startup, you can run circles around 98% of the sales reps at Salesforce or HubSpot. They have the brand, they have the partners, they have the integrations, but they cannot answer the questions you can answer.

Lenny (00:14:21):
Okay. So you close the first 10 customers. What are other signs that, "Okay. Now is really the time we need to start hiring sales"?

Jason Lemkin (00:14:26):
I think as soon as you've got those 10 customers and more than 20% of your time is booked up with customers, you need leverage. You need leverage. You've got to get ... If you do it too early, if you're not spending 20% of your time in sales and 20% of your time in recruiting, you're failing as a founder. You need 20% of each, 20% in sales and 20% recruiting. Nothing else really matters at some level as a CEO, maybe not as founders, but as CEOs. Once you cross the 20%, you need leverage or your calendar will die. So you need to hire one rep and you've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans. You have to A-B test humans. You've got to hire two as hard as it is, and there's just one cheat code to those first two. There's one cheat code. 

(00:15:13):
I talked to so many founders that screwed up their first sales hires, and they always nod when they hear it. Those first couple reps have to be people you would buy your own product from. That's it. Now we can talk about other criteria. We can talk about normalizing for deal size. We can talk about industry expertise. We can talk about all this kind of stuff, but when you go out as a first time founder and interview 30 reps, and you're going to have to interview 30, and 20 are just going to break your brain because they don't do any work and they don't do any prep and they didn't even go to your website. Then eight of the next 10 are okay, but you know it's not really going to work, but you might hire them if you get tired.

(00:15:50):
If you're lucky, one or two of them, they're like magicians. They ask the right questions, which we could talk about. Then take a pause and say, "Look, no matter how strange their background was, whatever they did, it's not the right background. It's not our same deal size. It's not our industry. They actually weren't very good at their last job. They got let go at their last job, but I would buy from Lenny. I know. I've been doing this for a year. Every day, I would buy from Lenny because Lenny just explained to me my product and my customer's problems in a way that I actually believe. Forget about what's on her LinkedIn or his LinkedIn. I would buy from Lenny." 

(00:16:23):
That rep always works because you can trust them with those leads. Almost every first time founder hires someone because they worked at Twilio or CloudFlare or wherever, and they talk the talk and they can say ACV and NRR, and they can talk all these acronyms. None of which matter. None of which matter. We all get attracted to logos on our resume, but in our gut, I always ask them, "Did you know that Jason was going to ... Would you buy from Jason?" They're like, "You're right. I wouldn't have bought from Jason, but he worked at Twilio." So just wait, wait and interview 30 sales reps, however you find them through LinkedIn, through use recruiters, use contingent recruiters. It's exhausting. Do everything. Work your network and then be flexible in the beginning. We're looking for pirates and romantics in the early days. We are not looking for folks with massive sales operations teams and enablement teams. You're looking for that quirky one that's got a few extra IQ points, that for reasons that make no sense has fallen in love with your little product that is so feature poor and does nothing, but they love it, they love it, they love it. 

(00:17:28):
My first rep I had this back in the day, he had gotten let go by a prior startup and he was struggling and he was living in his brother's garage at the time. This was not your number one person at Snowflake, but of all the 30, he came in and what's now Adobe sign? EchoSign. He described the whole problem. He described how we would solve the problem for our customers in the early days of this category. It was clear, whatever it took we needed him and whatever we needed to backfill the garage or whatever, this was the only one that could sell the product, and he did it for a decade. Closed our first five-figure deal, first six-figure deal, first seven-figure TCV deal. Didn't scale completely. Inside of Adobe was harder to scale inside of a 20,000 person company than it was in a six-person company, but he was still there. He still made that far to the journey, but he was the only one that I knew that I would buy my product from, not that I would buy something from, but I would buy my product from. 

(00:18:24):
Leads are so precious in the early days. It's so hard to find leads. That's the problem. You hire this perfect person from Snowflake and you have three leads a month and you give him two and he doesn't close them, your company's going to die. Leads are so precious. That's what folks don't get. So wait, and I know it's painful, and I know most founders have hired this person with the right LinkedIn that they wouldn't buy their product from. Just keep interviewing. You need that quirky pyromaniac that loves your product and can sell it. They're out there.

Lenny (00:18:57):
Amazing advice. Wow. There's so much there. I'm going to follow a couple threads there. In terms of the level, I know a lot of people make the mistake of going with a VP of sales pretty quickly. What's your advice? I know you talked about general attributes, but what's your advice for the level and seniority of these first two hires?

Jason Lemkin (00:19:14):
Two things, one that's evergreen and one that's maybe especially apropos for today's environment. The evergreen one, which I've talked about for over a decade, and I think folks that have been through it will see it, which is you need two sales reps hitting quota closing deals before you're ready to hire a manager for them. Almost all VPs of sales, their job is to take you from rep three to 300, to take you from three to 300, to take something that's just starting to repeat, a script that's just starting to work, leads that are just starting to come in. Then take Lenny and Jason, the two reps I have, as quirky as they are, they're crushing it. 

(00:19:55):
Then I'm going to hire a more heterogeneous type of person going forward. I'm going to hire the person from Cloudfare. They can't all be like Lenny and Jason, they're pretty quirky, but at least I can learn from them. What's working? What are the objections? How do we get around that feature gap? We're one year old, we're two years old. We've got a lot of feature gaps. This integration doesn't quite work. How do we box around those issues? How do we sell our 10x feature? Because if you're a startup, your product isn't very good, your software is not very good, and you have a competitor, but you have some 10x feature that is driving people to buy you something you're doing that does not exist in the marketplace.

(00:20:29):
The really good reps get insanely good at selling that, and the folks off the street, the new VPs often doesn't even understand the 10x feature. It's too subtle. It's too subtle. Why? The fact that your product is localized in Portuguese magically means you can win these deals. I'm making up something that doesn't quite make sense. So you need two reps that are hitting quota and then you hire VP of sales. If you hire it before then, you're doing a Hail Mary. It ain't going to work. It never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever works. You're asking them to find product market fit to be the first rep, to be the second rep and scale it all at the same time. It's mission impossible to do all four at the same time. 

(00:21:09):
So that's the biggest mistake is, Lenny, I can't get sales going at my company. I can't do it, but I raised $4 million in my C+ round. I'm going to go out and hire the VP of sales. That VP of sales will not be there in eight months. You know what else? 2 million of the four will be gone because they'll never understand the product. They will never understand. There's so many things we could talk about, but if there's one thing I could reinforce for this audience, it's that early sales team, they've got to be product gurus for your product audience. They've got to be product experts. Later as you scale, they can't be or you can't scale. 

(00:21:42):
When I started, when I came out of my own startup and started interviewing other folks, I remember I would interview a lot of folks at places like GitHub back in the day. I'd be like, "Do you have a technical background? Are you an engineer? Have you ever built any software?" They're like, "No, I don't. I don't know. I don't know," and I was like, "I was curious how you could do it," but GitHub was so well-established that it's 10 questions. It's 10 questions and grab a sales engineer. It's 10 questions and grab ... So you got to be really good at 10 and then you grab a sales engineer. That doesn't work in the early estate startups. So you've got to find these sales folks that are a bit of product savants and dropping the VP of sales in that isn't a product savant, which is a big issue. That's all mister or miss process. This is the issue. They're all mister or miss process.

(00:22:24):
So the second point I wanted to make, and I was on the fence for years of when you hire a VP of sales, do they need to carry a bag? Do they need to sell themselves or not? Does it matter? Does it matter? I wasn't sure for a long time. The reason I wasn't sure for a long time, it's not that you don't want a VP of sales carrying a bag. I do think a VP of engineering also should commit code. We can talk about that. 

Lenny (00:22:45):
Carrying a bag, meaning close sales themselves? 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:46):
Yeah, not just be a boss. 

Lenny (00:22:47):
Have a quota. 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:49):
Yeah, have a quote. The reason I was on the fence was because I was like, "Well, listen, in theory it's great, but let's say you're a hot startup and you want to go from two to six this year." So I want to add 4 million in new bookings, and let's say I can do 400K in quota per rep. That means I got to have 10 reps. She walks in with two. I'm at a race, aren't I? I got to hire eight in the next six months to hit my plan, and I got to put numbers on the board. If I'm going to out there as an individual contributor sales rep, I'm never going to hire eight people, am I? It's never going to happen. 

(00:23:20):
So I used to say I don't know if it matters, but what I've learned the last 18 to 20 months when everyone has gotten lazy, Lenny, everyone in tech has gotten lazy, is I see way too many VPs of sales that come in and never have any idea how to sell the product, never, never. They only want to be managers.

(00:23:38):
Now, whether they carry a bag or whether what they do is they join calls with the reps, whether they backfill the reps, you want your VP of sales in deals 20, 30 hours a week when they start. I see VPs of sales today start, they're in no deals. I'll go to a board meeting and a VP of sales will be there two, three months, and they'll have a look on the board. I'm like, "How's it going with Airbnb?" and they'll be like, "I don't know. I got to ask John." Doesn't know because it isn't in the deal, isn't even in the deal. So I see this too often.

(00:24:08):
Another company I'm on the board on, I really like this VP of sales a lot. He joined and six months in, sales were down from where, the new bookings were down from where they were six months before. He was honest. He's like, "The biggest problem is I feel like I didn't have time to learn this product. It's a complicated product. It's more complicated than the product I last sold, and I just didn't have time."

Lenny (00:24:29):
Jason, this conversation is going exactly how I'd hoped. There's so much actionable advice here. Let me try to summarize a little bit of the things you've said and then keep going. So let me know what I'm missing here. I'm going to try to just highlight some of the important things you mentioned. So in terms of when it makes sense to start hiring your first salesperson, a couple of things you shared is you've closed the first 10 customers on your own as founders. If you're spending more than 20% of your time on sales and you need to start creating more leverage. I'll throw in one other thing I've heard and just to tell me if this is also true, that there's a repeatable process you've created. You can sell consistently enough or you can tell someone, "Here's how I've been selling." Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:25:08):
Yeah. If you hire a VP of sales before then, it's approaching 100% chance of failure.

Lenny (00:25:13):
I see. So you can hire the first two reps before you're like, "Here's a pretty good process that has worked for me a number of times."

Jason Lemkin (00:25:19):
Yeah. Listen, as hard as it is for a lot of founders to even get their arms around, the reason is you've got to be that crummy first head of sales with them. You've got to manage those reps. You've got to be in the field with them. You've got to be figuring it out before you can hire the person. You just have to even if you're terrible at it because you're still going to be a good middler. You're still going to be a good middler.

Lenny (00:25:41):
Okay. A few more things that stood out to me. One is hire two sales reps immediately, not just one. These reps you need to interview about 30 people. Eight will be pretty good, 20 will be terrible, and two, these are people that you can see selling your product and you would buy from them. They're often very quirky and not maybe a traditional sales background. They've never been VPs of sales, essentially. They're more like AEs and things like that historically or maybe not even salespeople historically. Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:26:10):
I think you will regret it if you don't hire these first couple of sales reps that have a couple years of experience if you're in B2B with B2B sales. They need a couple of years of experience and they need a certain amount of maturity, and maturity is a real issue, and these are in any early hire because we just don't have time to babysit people. There's no onboarding, there's no training. So they need a couple years of experience, ideally something close to your deal size, we could chat about why, that would be nice, and enough maturity that you can trust them with that lead. You can trust them with your customer.

Lenny (00:26:43):
Okay. Then you hire a VP of sales once you're ready to go from three to 300 reps. Your advice is also give the VP of sales a bag slash a quota slash they need to be doing sales themselves in today's world.

Jason Lemkin (00:26:56):
At least for a little while. More importantly, if they don't want to, I think in today's world you got to run from them. Exactly whether they fully carry a quota, a half quota, whether they backfill the sales team, you want a salesperson. Here's the thing, Lenny, you want a ... This is going to sound silly, but it's not. Trust me on this. For anyone watching, listening, you want a head of sales that actually wants to do sales. I got to tell you, and I'm still struggling with this myself after the last three years or so, so many folks in all functions, we could talk about other functions too, but especially in sales, don't want to do sales anymore. They don't want to do it. They don't want do it. 

(00:27:39):
2021 was crazy because everything was too crazy. There's too much money, too much going on. 2022 was the knife falling. That was crazy too. 2023 was just hard. Whether it's burnout or whatever out or just too much change, I would say I've probably interviewed for different reasons, 50 VPs of sales in the last 12 months, I would say the majority don't want to do sales. It's my first screening question. That's why they got to carry a bag because it proves they actually still care about the craft. 

(00:28:12):
The best sales folks love sales. It's a craft. They love money. Yes, they love money, and that does matter. Do not hire a sales rep that doesn't like money. Trust me on this one. There's 0% chance they'll work out either, but they also like the craft. They like honing the script. They like beating the competition. They like figuring out the counterfeit. They like figuring out the weapon and the 10x feature. They like working on a team. They like hunting. They love it, but then sometimes I just think burnout is always a reality, but I just think that the last three years have been so yo-yoed, that folks are just, they're out. They're out. Don't hire them no matter how smart they are, and that's the test. 

(00:28:52):
I'll tell you, I talked with a really great VP of sales candidate that had worked with a top 10 tech company and I asked him what he wanted to do in this next role. He's like, "I've got a great team. I've got eight people that I can bring with me. We're ready to lock and load." I'm like, "Okay. Well, let me tell you one of my views in today's world is that you've got to actually visit more customers now, not less. In a distributed world, it's more important to visit customers." He lived in the East Bay in Pleasanton in the East Bay, which is maybe 20 minutes east of Oakland. He said, "I'm willing to visit customers, but I won't go as far as the peninsula in San Francisco." He's just happy at home. He's happy at home, Lenny, and he don't want to sell.

(00:29:34):
This guy has the best LinkedIn and the best references, but he don't want to sell anymore. He needs a job. He wants to be a VP of sales. I see this across the industry and I'm struggling to find answers. I think the biggest hiring ... We talked about a lot of tactical hiring mistakes that you can make today in sales. The biggest strategic mistake you can make today in sales because there's so many veterans, there's so many folks that worked at Twilio and Mongo and wherever, pick any great company you want. There's so many veterans out there, you just can't hire the ones that don't actually want to sell anymore, and there's too many, there's too many.

Lenny (00:30:06):
You mentioned that you actually just asked them in the interview. The first question is, "Do you actually want to sell?" What other questions do you ask for either ... Let's go through both. You said you have these questions that you ask for the early hires and then the VP of sales. What are some tips for people when they're interviewing these folks?

Jason Lemkin (00:30:21):
It's interesting. VP of sales or VP of product, I look for the same answer. One of the Colombo style questions I ask them, and this is so odd. It barely even counts as a question is, what do you want to do your first 30 days? What do you want to do? Actually, I usually ask, "What do you want to do your first two weeks?" In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out. There's too many VPs of product too, Lenny, that don't want to meet customers anymore either. The majority of VPs of products that I interview, they don't meet customers. Every single great VP of product, chief product officer I've ever worked with in my entire career, you know what the first thing they do in the first two weeks? They're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone."

Jason Lemkin (00:31:00):
The first two weeks, they're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I'm going to go talk..." They don't want to sit out on meetings and look at PRDs and talk out of their navel on endless internal meetings. All the best ones, they say they just leave. They literally say, "Leave me alone. I will see you in two weeks. I'm going to go meet with 20 customers." And that's what products should do. Sales, whether it's prospects or existing customers, it can vary, but they should be like, "On my first day, I want to join five calls." 

(00:31:29):
And when you hear that story of, "I don't want to travel out of Pleasanton," or they say, here's what you're going to hear from the wrong person for anything, even up to 50 million in revenue, "I'm going to spend that first month working on process," "I'm going to spend that first month getting Salesforce up and running," "I'm going to send the first month on territory planning, Lenny, because we really, with our three reps, I really want to make sure we've nailed territories, right? Lenny will do the south, Elaine will do the east, Jason will do the west." 

(00:31:59):
When you hear process, process, process, from any, from marketing, product, sales, customer success, too, boy, it's the death of customer success. It's just... And it's not that you don't need process, it's just, it's even worse than it was than a few years ago. And I know this is going to trigger some people, but the truth is they don't want to work. They don't want to work. They don't want to work. 

(00:32:21):
I literally just got this LinkedIn email to work with me at SaaStr, from this person who'd been reading SaaStr for eight years. You're like, "I want to run account management, customer success for you. Here's what's, you're doing wrong, here's how to do it." I'm like, "Oh, this is pretty good." And I DMed her back, I'm like, "Great. To be honest, you realize that you're actually going to have to talk to customers and sponsors yourself in the beginning." No response. Just out. Just out. And that was the best one I got the last 30 days. That was the best inbound that I personally got. 

(00:32:51):
I know it sounds triggering or critical, but as founders, we have to be honest that there's this vast pool of veterans with great LinkedIns and great resumes that are so burnt out, Lenny. And let's not blame them. I know it sounds like I'm blaming them or being negative, and I'm trying to not be negative. I'm empathetic. I am empathetic to the burnout, but don't, you can't hire these. There's too many. 

(00:33:14):
The industry is littered with the burnt out. They're littered with it. And if you hear a touch of cynicism, if you hear anger, if you hear, "I don't want to meet customers in any..." and I'm going to say any VP role, product, sales, marketing, customers... If they don't want to meet customers their first, let's make it a 14-day test, you know they're never going to want to meet customers.

Lenny (00:33:33):
These folks that don't want to do sales that are VPs of sales, I imagine when you're further along, that's more, okay, because you don't need them to be doing sales, right? They want to manage, optimize. No. I see you shaking your head?

Jason Lemkin (00:33:46):
I mean, okay, you think, okay, there's an element, let's call it north of 50 or 100 million, where for, what's sometimes called commercial sales, SMB sales, it really is all process. Okay? So for sure, I agree. But at Salesforce, they're trying to close $100-million-plus deals. You think that the sales leadership doesn't need to be in those deals? You think they can just hit refresh on the dashboards and track them from home? No. Marc Benioff today is still flying to meet customers. He said the other day, why does Marc Benioff go to Davos? He sits, and I've never been to Davos. He sits at the same place, at the top of some staircase. Okay? 

(00:34:26):
And Salesforce drops millions of dollars, and he waits to meet customers, prospects, and partners in person all day, because it's efficient. Because it's efficient. Because he can do 50 or 100 customer or prospect meetings a day at Davos. He's still doing it at 30-something billion in revenue. Right? So this idea that, is there some truth at... For example, when I worked at Adobe back in the day, it is true that Adobe, which was, parts of the business, sales literally was dashboards. I get it. Okay, at four billion, 10 billion in revenue, but most of your audience is not ready to hire at four billion or 10 billion in revenue. They're not ready to hire that person. Don't hire them, right?

Lenny (00:35:08):
I don't know, maybe Satya's listening. You never know.

Jason Lemkin (00:35:12):
I think on the sales side of the business, they're flying out to the big deals?

Lenny (00:35:17):
To close the loop on this thread, when you're interviewing the early sales reps, those first two quirky folks, what are some questions and ways to know if there may be a good fit? You mentioned one of, you feel like you would buy from them?

Jason Lemkin (00:35:30):
Okay. The one, really, the simplest one, and early in my career, I thought this was silly or hated it, this Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't know if it was Glengarry Glen Ross or that toxic Leo movie about sales, which is still entertaining. Yeah, one way or another, Lenny, it's got to be, "Sell me this pen." But it's not "Sell me this pen," it's "Sell me this app." So I don't like surprises, I don't like games. I like to do this in a second interview or whatever. Give them time. And I don't like to judge too harshly, but whether it's the first interview or the second, they got to sell you this pen. They've got to put in the 30 minutes of work and maybe it's two hours.

(00:36:07):
But here's the thing, today's world, you can go on YouTube or someone's website... There's an explainer video for every product under the sun, isn't there? I am shocked how many salespeople I have met, Lenny, from SDR to SEB of sales that, by the time... And I'm doing an interview for a portfolio company, this isn't a screener interview, they haven't even watched an explainer video yet. I could be the fifth or eighth interview, and they don't know how the product works. They have not even gone to the effort of searching YouTube or the homepage and watching it. 

(00:36:38):
And forget about explainer videos enough. But so many companies do webinars now and they publish them on the... Really good stuff, customer testimonials. Right? If you're a sales rep, you don't actually have to know how the webhooks work or how to provision an API key, but you need to know the product as well as that webinar that's on YouTube. And 98 out of 100 folks won't bother in an interview. They won't bother. They're just going to click on "Apply" on the ATS and tell you, "Hey, I recently stumbled upon whatever. It looks like... Do you have time to discuss." Right?

(00:37:10):
But that one that actually does enough work and watches the video, and then can sell it to you, and they're going to make mistakes. They're not going to get it right, but they have enough confidence with the core problem to be solved. Because here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B. We're solving problems. And this is why so many people are struggling in 2024, because they can't... their products, as sales reps, as companies, they can't solve big problems anymore. 

(00:37:41):
Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition. I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. And I'm going to help you understand, Lenny, because you're in the market for the car, why this is the best one. I'm going to be honest about where it's not. I'm going to answer all your questions. I'm such an expert, and then I'm going to ask you, Lenny, when is that... You have 280,000 miles on the Civic? Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. And I've even got a special discount for the end of this month. And let me just help you."

(00:38:14):
And I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I'm explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. And I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house, there's only supercharges. I got you, don't I? And that's the job of SaaS and sales, because we're not selling commodities. And that's why the best reps will also tell reps when not to buy their product. 

(00:38:41):
As painful as that seems in tougher times, in 2024, the best reps say, "No, we're not there yet. We're not the right... If you need this feature, if you need this integration, I want you back in six months when you use this big product that isn't that great. But today, we're not the right solution for you." That's, the best ones do that. They have the confidence to know to close it. And the rest of the world thinks this is some sort of adversarial transactional thing and it's not. Right? 

(00:39:07):
Software... I think hopefully all your audience would agree, when it's done right, software's magical. It solves incredible problems, incredible problems. What Airbnb does, what Uber does, what SaaS... Things solve... I can track my customers, I can manage, I can automate my communications. It's magical. You shouldn't have to use boiler room tactics and use [inaudible 00:39:30] tactics when you have something. But, it doesn't sell itself, except for a little while in late 2020, early 2021, that screwed the whole world up when products actually sold themselves.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I feel like this is a separate podcast we should do of just how to get better at sales and how to sell. But, I feel like that's its own hour of conversation. I did a great episode with April Dunford where, I don't know if you follow her stuff, but she-

Jason Lemkin (00:39:54):
Yes. 

Lenny (00:39:54):
... essentially describes exactly your approach of help people understand the market, help them understand the entire landscape, and then talk about your problem. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. Has a lot of good advice there. In terms of this interview, selling-me-a-pen approach, to give people something very concrete to do. How do you actually set this up? Is it like, "Sell me your product," and then they put together a pitch for your team and they pitch you on a product?

Jason Lemkin (00:40:19):
I'll tell you, until the boom, until everyone in late 2020 got so desperate to hire anyone with a pulse, almost everyone in sales had to come and they had, during an interview process, they actually had to do the pitch. They would come and you used to do it in person with this screen. You can do it on Zoom now, it really doesn't matter, but do it for real. Do it for real, and everyone would see. And everyone in recruiting change, people stopped doing reference checks, they stopped doing these tests, and they would just hire warm bodies.

(00:40:51):
Late 2020, I can tell you a funny story in a second, and it was okay until it wasn't. And our hiring processes have not reverted back to pre-March, 2020, and I think it's failing founders left and right. I can't tell you, I would say 95% of the hiring I see out there, people don't do reference checks anymore, Lenny. And we can talk about when they work and when they don't, but no one does them. No one does them. You're going to invest so much... Forget about the salary, it doesn't really matter. So much time, your time, your leads, everything's so precious, to bring Jason into your company and you're going to go through all this recruiting process and you're not even going to do any reference checks? People don't even do reference checks.

(00:41:33):
And they don't, they stopped doing, "Do me this demo," because they were so worried the rep would go to Gusto or would go to Deal, or would go to remote. There was no time. I got to get... This SDR has 50 offers. Lenny, we got to hire this SDR with three weeks of experience. We've got to decide today. And that's the way, and hiring does not come back. If those hires bounce, not only is it bad for you, but it's a disservice to the... It's worse for the hire. I mean, that poor CloudFlare woman that blew up with the thing, there's so many issues there we could dig into, but it's all Cloudflare fault for hiring her. Okay, let's forget about that she didn't close a single deal. Okay, so objectively, in sales, should you retain your job in sales if you can't close a single deal? I don't want to get into some of the triggering things, but remember, if you hire someone and they fail, it's all your fault. She didn't know what she was getting herself into. No candidates can do enough diligence ever. There's not enough time. There isn't enough time. 

(00:42:32):
And this is true all the way to the top. And so, as an investor, a board member, it's funny, when I do interviews, I do this thing, I try to be the last interview sometimes, and the founders don't want me to do it. They want me to sell. I don't want to be the last one. And what I want to do is when, Lenny, you've decided to join Ellen at her startup, right? At the end, I said, "Look, Lenny, I've talked to Ellen, she loves you. You have the job. You've got the job. What I don't want you to do, Lenny is bouncing three months after. So let's slow down, let's talk about the questions you have on your mind, and let's have a safe space where we can make sure you're going to be happy and successful there." Right? 

(00:43:09):
And sometimes even the founders get mad at me for doing this, because sometimes, the candidate bails. But I'm like, "I know you're mad at me today, but it is your fault. A hundred percent your fault if any of your hires fail. Don't blame them. And I'm guilty of this. I get upset when people start and they don't give it their all or they don't do it. I mean, what if you hired someone for your podcast and they decided, "You know what? I don't want to do the podcast this week. I'm tired. I'll do it..." You're so mad at them, but you should've seen it during the hiring process. Right?

(00:43:44):
So, tying it back, that's why you've got to do this, "Sell me this pen." You've got to, before you hire the salesperson, have them sell your product real. Do the demo. And if they need more time, give them more time. Let them watch another demo. Don't have them feel like it's a trap or spook them. Treat them the way you would like to be treated. But if you skip this step, I mean, what's the point? You're not helping them.

Lenny (00:44:09):
What I love about this process is it connects exactly to what you recommended you look for in these hires is, "Would I buy my product from these people?" So this makes a lot of sense. And you give them this assignment at home and they do work on this and they come in, right? It's not like come to the office?

Jason Lemkin (00:44:22):
If you talk to a great transactional VP of sales that's hiring tons of reps that do it, they'll make them do... If they're still doing this, they'll make you sell the pen fast in the process. They don't have time. They're doing 20 interviews a week, 30 interviews a week, you've got to sell me this pen. But if you're a founder and I'm talking about you've already talked to a bunch of candidates, you're down to one or two, make them, tell them, "Look, this isn't a trick. I'm not that great at telling my product myself, but I got to know that you're going to be happy and successful here. So do a demo for me."

(00:44:49):
And if they won't do it, they're not a salesperson. And too many people went into sales, not... The other weird thing about B2B sales in good times is actually, a lot of these folks are not really what you might think as salespeople. They can't do outbound, they can't pick up the phone. All they know how to do is to manage leads that come in and say, "I want to buy today." And you need those people, too. Okay? And I'm not saying you don't need those people, too, but that's not always what we think of as sales.

Lenny (00:45:16):
Another black box for me, and I think a lot of people with sales, is comp and quota, had actually set up their comp for early hires, and then how to actually decide on a quota. What advice do you have for figuring that out early on? What percentage is commission, what percentage is salary? All that-

Jason Lemkin (00:45:31):
Yeah, everyone gets this wrong. We worry... Look, at scale, when you're extremely mature, extremely mature, and very profitable, you really got to tweak this stuff very carefully, and we could talk about that if it's relevant. But, in the beginning, we get this all wrong. What matters is, can a sales rep close more than they take home? In the very beginning, that's all that matters. It's just you selling, right?

(00:45:58):
The first three months of a new rep, you're lucky if they can close as much as their take-home pay is, their OT. And so, in the really early days, my early, early day comp plan is, look, your first three months, you keep a hundred percent of what you close. Of course, that's not profitable for the business, but you've got to invest in them, right? You keep a hundred percent of what you close. And if you have enough going on in your business, usually, that's enough to put supper on the stove. 

Lenny (00:46:24):
And that's without a salary? 

Jason Lemkin (00:46:26):
No, no. You pick an OT, a salary, but you got to... Okay, let's step back for a minute. You got to pay market. You got to pay market. And in the early days, if you're bootstrapped or really lean, this stresses folks out. I just talked to this great rep, Lenny, but he wants 150k OTE. And in fact, it's a step down. He had 170k at Slack, but he knows this isn't a startup. He wants 100. He might take 140.

Lenny (00:46:53):
And OTE is total comp, overall total comp.

Jason Lemkin (00:46:54):
Total comp. And the founder panics. "I don't have, I'm only making 60. How can I pay 140?" Well, let's break it down for a minute. First of all, let's be tactical. It's usually 50/50, right? 50% base, 50% bonus for a sales rep. So they're really only taking home a 70k base, trying to make another 70. Okay? Then 70 divided by 12, help me do my math. It's not quite 6k month. Well, maybe with taxes it is. You're really only paying 6k a month for a couple months to see if this experiment works out. You're investing 20,000, you don't have $20,000 to do sales? Then don't do sales, if you can't find $20,000. So people freak out too much about this comp-line number, this base and bonus, the on-target earnings, OTE, and they're not more practical about what am I committing to cash upfront? 

(00:47:44):
Two, you need a plan where it's a win-win. So if this person makes 140, but ultimately, a sales rep's got to bring in four to five times what they take home. That 140's got to be 500, 600 or more. The more enterprise you are, the bigger the multiple has to be, and the higher the comp. But it's got to be 3x to 5x at a minimum, 3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, 5... You got to get there, but you don't have to be there on day one and two. When you get there, the reps should be accretive, shouldn't they be? If they make 150 and they bring in 450, unless your marketing costs are out of control, which can happen, but that's not sales fault is it? If your marketing costs are reasonable and you pay a sales rep 150 for closing 450, if you engineer your plan right, you should be smiling, not frowning.

(00:48:34):
Where it gets tough is when you have a ton of folks not closing. When you have a ton of folks not closing and you have extremely high marketing costs, then it all breaks. Your cap breaks, your payback period breaks. But, if you have inbound leads, if you have demand, and you have sales reps that can sell you this pen, they're going to be accretive, Lenny, because of that math. And take the pressure off, don't make them close 5x their take on their first quarter, make them close 1x. Let them put points on board, let them eat. And so negotiating, here's the point if you think about it. Negotiating someone down from a 150k OTE to 130, it's not going to make any difference. You want them to close 600 or 700. It's not going to matter. 

(00:49:15):
At scale, does it matter? For Mongo maybe. Maybe. But, what you care about is how much more can they close and they bring in? And then you, that's why you want them to make a lot of money. You want them to be rich. You want them to take home a lot for a whole bunch of reasons. And so, don't freak out about the acronym OTE, what they take home. Figure out what it's really going to cost you and would you buy from them? And if you would, they're probably going to bring in more than they take home. Right? And on the marketing side, in early days, you're lucky if you can find a marketing channel that is that accretive.

Lenny (00:49:49):
Amazing. Okay. So just to summarize, you start a sales person with, say, 75k in salary and then say 75k in expected sales. And they take-

Jason Lemkin (00:50:01):
Bonus, bonus.

Lenny (00:50:02):
Bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:04):
Bonus from sales, yep. 

Lenny (00:50:05):
Bonus from sales and the the idea there is they take 100% initially of their sales, for the first month or two, just to make it feel amazing. They're making money. See how they're doing, don't put a lot of pressure on them. And then the plan is, over time, get it to a point where they're bringing into the business four to five times what they're taking home in terms of bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:24):
Yeah, yeah. 

Lenny (00:50:25):
I set expectations every month or two, or is it every quarter? We're going to revisit your comp and quota and adjust.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:32):
If you get it right, you never have to revisit it. Not for years. I mean, I'm using the same sales comp plan I have for a lot of years. It still works. Listen, you can make tweaks and you've got to listen, and we're all human beings. And people, and again, remember, your sales team has to eat. They've got to eat, okay? And you've got to be somewhat competitive. But, there's only so much you can tweak, Lenny. I mean, they have to bring, close more than they bring home. Right?

(00:50:55):
And so, you can make tweaks at the margin. The problem is if you make too many tweaks to this model, you burn up all the cash. You're trying to plug a leaky boat, there's no point. There's no point. There's no point. And remember, related to this, for a long time, for most folks, unless you're, even if you're hyper funded, you're better off with fewer, better reps than more reps.

(00:51:18):
There is a stage when you get big enough where this concept of capacity planning really does matter. Lenny, if I got to go from 50 to 100 this year, okay? I'm going to add 50 million. If each of my reps can do 500k, I need a hundred, don't I? Okay. And literally, if you have 20, you mathematically cannot hit the plan. So there's a certain truth at scale. In the early days, this is a rookie error. I'd much rather have two reps, each closing a million than 20 reps struggling to close 100k each. Culturally, it's terrible. There's no domain knowledge in the company. Everyone's miserable, everyone's fighting. 

(00:51:50):
What you want to do in the early days is concentrate your leads and your best closers, at the same time, bringing new people up. But you've got to concentrate your leads to your best closers. And that means year two, year three, year four, they should be making a lot of money. Lot of money, sometimes too much. I remember the first investment I ever made was a company called Pipedrive, which sold for a billion and a half. SMB CRM, and I put in the first sales rep there. He used to work for me. And the founders got mad at him. They got mad at him, because in three months, he was making more than any of the founders. They were pissed. 

(00:52:21):
I'm like, "Guys, I know we're have different backgrounds and cultures, but this is what you want." But it took them a long time culturally as self-serve... Because Pipedrive was 100% self-serve at the time. They'd never had a sales rep. And I put the guy in, and what he did was he went and he looked, all these self-serve customers, he's like, this was the company was about two million revenue at the time. And he's like, "Okay, who's bought more than one seat?" He just did a reverse sort and he called them. 

(00:52:48):
I remember he called AOL back in the day and he's like, "You guys have 20 seats of Pipedrive. Would you like to buy more for your sales team?" They're like, "Thank you very much. We'll take 100 seats." And he just went down the list, from the top to the bottom, and he took home 20% of those deals. Now that difference, that extra 80 seats at AOL, he brought it in. So Kim, keeping 20% of that is a great deal for the company, right? But he was pretty good at it and he was the only person for a while, so he made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars when the poor company, the founders were paying themselves 50.

Lenny (00:53:20):
So your advice there is don't be sad if your salesperson is making tons of money.

Jason Lemkin (00:53:25):
If you architect the simple sales fund we talked about, and they're making a lot of money, you're making a lot of money, and your equity is worth a lot of money, your equity is worth a lot of money. Right?

Lenny (00:53:34):
When do you make that switch from they're taking home 100% of what they're selling to smaller percentage?

Jason Lemkin (00:53:40):
Look, some people are going to think it's goofy what I said about 100. I just view it as a simple ramp. I think you do it for one quarter max. One quarter. The problem is if you let this go for too long, more than a quarter, if you make it too easy for long a quarter, the problem is the mediocre lean into it too much, and that doesn't help. And not only does it not help you, it doesn't help them. You don't want to make mishires. They're so damn... I mean, you could have a whole podcast only just on mishires. It's probably the single most important thing in scaling startups. It's not hires, it's mishires.

(00:54:12):
It's a tragedy if you mis-hire a rep, but you don't want them there six months. It's not good for them either. You want to support them, you want to help them find a place where they're successful. And here's the quirky thing on the mishires, and this is why that first guy I hired was mid-pack. He was less than mid-pack. Here's the thing about sales is, someone can be very good in certain sales environments and completely fail in other ones, completely fail. It's probably more binary than any other function. And so you got to find it before you hire them, but you also got to root it out fast, because those leads are too precious.

(00:54:44):
And it doesn't mean they won't go on to another company and be wildly successful, but you could utterly fail. And the one related point I'll give, if I had to throw one hint on this first, any of these reps, first 10 and VP of sales, one hint more than anything else, trust... got to hire someone whose last product was harder to sell. This is so important. This is a recipe for utter disaster. If you've, take someone in sales and their last product was easier to sell, they will have none of the skills to sell your product. But, this is the... and I'll give you an example in a second. 

(00:55:27):
If you hire someone from something that was just a smidge harder, a smidge harder to sell, and they come into your company, it's like they're on Mars. It's like weight has been released from their feet. They learned how to sell a harder product and get it done, and then they come to you. And the first example I had, the first SDR I hired was a guy named Sam Blond, who went on to be CRO at Brex, and then now is a partner at Founders Fund. We worked together from the very beginning, first SDR. And he came, before that, he was an SDR at a company called Intacct, which was bought for a billion, which was online financials. Okay?

(00:56:03):
And back in the day, we know what the one thing people didn't want to put in their cloud was? Their financial statements, okay? It just wasn't trusted that. There are some things you would trust to the cloud, like A CRM, but they'd be like, "These are my crown jewels. I can't put these..." So he went from desperately trying to convince folks to move a business process to the cloud. They had no interest. And he came to us, and it was hard, but it wasn't that hard. And he instantly was number one. He went from SDR to SMB-AE to mid-market AE to director of sales, to head of this whole sale... 

(00:56:31):
Because, I mean, there are many reasons he was great, but he came to me and I said, "Sam, why are you crushing it when everyone else here is struggling?" He's like, "This is much easier than Intacct." So hire someone like that and don't make... No matter how much you like them, the sell me this pen thing will control for it a bit, okay? But, when we give, we give, we give in the hiring process. We never give what we want. Be very, very careful if the last product was easier to sell.

Lenny (00:56:57):
I love this advice. What is a heuristic that the last product was harder to sell than yours? What tells you that that's probably true?

Jason Lemkin (00:57:04):
Be very careful if it was more technical, very technical. Some folks can go from a business process sale. They can go from selling a Gong or a sales software and outreach, and they can go sell a complicated API to VPs of engineering or VPs of product, but most can't. Okay? So more technical is a tough heuristic. More competitive is a positive. What really works, Lenny, is if you hire someone from the number four in the space and they did well. You take someone that was number four in the space and then you're number two in the space? You think number two's really hard because number one's crushing you? But they're at number four in a space where no one can tell the difference between these products? That's a great one, right? So a space that's more competitive, a space that is a positive, more technical.

(00:57:55):
The other one related to technical, on the pure B2B side, is much more complicated business process. I see folks fail in B2B when they've sold us... Yeah, it's hard, but they've sold a simple business process. They go to something that's got a lot of integrations, a lot of complexity, and a lot of business process change, and they just melt because it's too complicated. They just melt, right? There's a company I invested in, it's doing over 20 million today. And for some reason, to simplify what they do, which is pretty complicated, they called it the Gong for X. Okay? The Gong for X.

(00:58:30):
And it's great to get a VC meeting and a few other, but it's not even on their homepage, okay? It doesn't really make sense. And the CEO had me listen to this senior sales exec he hired, and the only thing he could tell the prospect was that they were Gong for X. And the prospect kept asking, "Well, how does this deep integration with this business process flow and Zendesk works, and how does this go over to Salesforce?" He's like, "Well, we're Gong for X." That $600,000 deal was lost. Right? 

(00:59:00):
But, maybe that works in some space, right? And Gong's hard to sell today, too, don't get me wrong. But you see my point, it's just that simplicity, it's too complicated, right? And I know it's not the perfect heuristic, other than this technical thing, but the technical one, man, trust me. Too many B2B type reps melt in B2D. They just melt. They just, selling to VP of eng is a different... It's the same beast, but they don't suffer fools, do they? Not the VP of engineerings I'm close. They don't suffer fools.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I haven't heard this term, B2D before, business to developers. 

Jason Lemkin (00:59:35):
To developer, yeah. 

Lenny (00:59:36):
I imagine that what it stands for. Oh, interesting. Haven't heard that term before. Okay, let me zoom out a bit and I want to move on to a different topic. But before we do that, so we've talked about kind of these early days of hiring your first two reps, getting your VP of sales to help scale out the team. To give people a sense of where this goes, as the business scales, what does the org evolution look like? You have these two reps doing sales on their own, then you have a manager. What does it look like over the next couple phases of the sales org?

Jason Lemkin (01:00:03):
Look, to simplify, there's rules of eight. So in sales, I'm actually not sure what the tip of heuristic is in product, because product teams are leaner, at least I hope. I like it when they're leaner. But the thing about sales is there's no efficiency. If you have a sales-led motion, half your company is going to be in sales at 10 millionaire, half your company is going to be in sales at 50, half your company is going to be in sales at 100. 

(01:00:27):
One of the tough parts of the software model is that there's no, there's actually almost anti-efficiencies in sales. The public companies are actually less, they have the higher CACs than startups, believe it or not, because they have so much market penetration. So you're going to need a lot of people. And it's rules of eight, eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager, eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them.

(01:00:51):
And then when you really scale, eight directors. You don't really ever going to have eight directors, but eight directors could have a VP or eight reports. And so there's rules of eight. If you want to build an organization on it, it's all rules of eight. For a while, for SDRs, thinking this was this high velocity entry-level position, people pushed it to 12. But the more folks I talk to today, the more I hear, everyone's reverted to eight. I'd rather have fewer SDRs, having better conversations. And so it's just, you can build your whole org with eights.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is way too easy of an answer. So the idea there is you hire this VP of sales, then you hire six more sales reps, AEs. So what happens next? You hire another-

Jason Lemkin (01:01:32):
Got to start hiring managers.

Lenny (01:01:32):
Manager, got it. Yeah. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:01:34):
And then you scale eight more reps.

Jason Lemkin (01:01:35):
And once you have eight AEs scaled, you almost always are going to start, a VP's going to already... A good VP of sales already be hunting two directors.

Lenny (01:01:44):
Two directors. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:45):
Whether they're just split up normally, whether they're east, west is a classic way. Another way, you might have smaller and larger customers. That's pretty standard, right? Commercial and enterprise. But a good VP of sales, once you have, she or he has eight reports, will be bringing in two directors, or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title-

Jason Lemkin (01:02:00):
... directors or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title inflation today, which doesn't bother me nearly as much as a lot of other things we've chatted about. I don't care what your title is if you'll actually do sales or do work, but yeah, we need to bring in managers at 8:00. And folks that can, also, a related point is, a lot of founders were, "When will my ... " I really love my head of sales, but she's a stretch. Most of them should be stretches.

(01:02:25):
If you hire the seasoned one, they're not going to work, so for 95 out of 100 of us, our first head of sales should be a stretch VP of Sales. And what that means is, usually, they were a director before that or a senior director or sort of a VP, okay? But you should be cautious about hiring your first VP of Sales for their first third VP of Sales gig. They're not willing to do the job anymore. You need a stretch and it's worth it for their career growth. It's worth it for their personal growth. It's worth it for the equity, right? So you're going to hire a stretch. That's an important tip right there. But then, you're going to be a little worried, how far can Lenny go? How far can ... I love Lenny, but he was a director for two years before this, and this is his first rule, and he did so good last year, but I'm worried Lenny's going to break. I'm worried Lenny's going to break.

(01:03:09):
And related to this quote, the simple answer is, Lenny will break if he can't source those directors under him. You can scale forever as a sales leader if you can hire better managers under you. And it's true of any functional area, but what you'll see in sales is, you'll see your stretch VP of Sales drown when they never can hire better managers under them, They'll end up doing some weird internal promotions, which you want, you want to do internal promotions. My rule is you want to promote 50% from within and hire 50% without for your managers, but if, really, the only people you can promote are just junior people on your team, you can't find leaders, you can't scale. I do see this happen too frequently is, a first time out of sales, does it, and then, they're like, "Here are my managers, Lorraine and Jason, but they really were just reps for two years and they don't know how to do it." So you have a whole bunch of people who don't know how to do it. That's when the organization cracks.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2x to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.

(01:05:11):
Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(01:05:26):
There's these terms that we throw, around account executive reps. It might be helpful just to give people a sense of what does this actually mean when someone's an account executive. Is it that they're just sitting there calling and doing sales directly? Whatever the key terms are for the roles or the title might be helpful to quickly summarize.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:42):
Yeah, I think the two ones that are probably less obvious for folks that are new are SDR, Sales development representative, and AE, account executive.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay, great.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:49):
And SDR is, generally, although I wish it wasn't, it is generally an entry level position, often fresh out of school, generally paid on the order of 60K to 80K, OTE and SaaS and US-based SaaS, and their job is to email for dollars, dial for dollars, and in many cases, to screen, to screen inbound leads. It's entry level, and their job is to pass on a lead to a sales executive, an account executive, an AE. Not all companies have SDRs. It's a longer topic, but pretty much all the best teams have some type of SDR function now because we've learned we want to specialize. We want openers opening and we want closers closing, so that's the rough idea.

(01:06:34):
SDRs are openers in some cases, and account executives are the more seasoned folks closing. And it varies, compensation from account executives that are US-based could be anywhere from like 90K to 200K, depending on, that's with base and bonus split at 50/50, depending on whether they're hunting tiny deals or big ones. That's the way an account executive works. And I think what doesn't happen today ... Those are the acronyms, SDR and AE. I think people can figure out VP of Sales, that's vice president of sales.

(01:07:03):
I think a thing that's gone on in the industry that founders expect now because there's so much discussion of it on LinkedIn and social media, but I haven't found work, is that an account executive will magically be full stack. They will do outbound themselves, they'll go use ZoomInfo and Apollo and develop a list themselves, they'll manage that outbound list themselves. If they don't have enough inbound, in their free time, you know what they'll do, Lenny, in their free time? They'll just do more outbound. You know what sales reps do in their free time? Today, they sell real estate or courses.

(01:07:36):
If you want a tip, for founders, I know you want this full stack AE, and they do exist when they're micromanaged in certain high performance sales organizations, but they don't exist in real life. They're specialized. Most AEs, they want to be closers, they want to be handed a lead, a contact me, a lead. They want to work the lead and close the lead, and you hire some SDRs to help generate more demand. Those are the basic acronyms. What's hard for most founders, here's the tough part, most founders have enough stamina to manage a couple of these AEs, these account executives, these folks who work the leads. Most founders do not have the stamina to manage 10 kids fresh out of college that need to be micromanaged on an hourly basis to call leads. Very, very few founders themselves can manage a team of SDRs, but if you can, it's like a superpower.

Lenny (01:08:28):
That was really helpful. I did not know what exactly these terms represented, and when you're hiring those first two reps, they should be at the account executive level.

Jason Lemkin (01:08:37):
Yes. And they'll do some outbound and they'll do some of this SDR work. It's just, ultimately, people end up specializing.

Lenny (01:08:43):
What is the title for someone above the account executive? Is it Director of Sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:08:46):
Yeah. There's really no ... It's a meta topic. I wish there were another career path for these ICs. This does exist in product, it does exist in engineering. It should exist in sales, but the truth is it doesn't. There is no senior SDR for this outbound. And for this AE, this person closing, yes, you can go more enterprise and make more money, but there isn't really a senior AE track, but there should be. It's unfortunate. It should be.

(01:09:15):
Too many of these folks are looking for, they look to go into management for promotion when what they really should look for is to be a super IC, and it's a shame that more folks don't try to implement a super IC role in sales, but that's basically what the career path is in management. And that's why another tip, another mistake that founders often make is, they hire the number one account executive at a hot company to be their head of sales. It's not the same skills. Most sales executives should not be managers. They don't want to be managers. They want to be individuals. They want to be highly paid individual contributors, these days, that mostly work from home and make a lot of money working 30 hours a week. That does not naturally breed great management skills.

Lenny (01:10:02):
I want to shift directions a little bit and talk about product and sales. A lot of listeners of this podcast are product managers or founders building products. How involved should product managers be in sales. And vice versa, how involved should sales be in the roadmap and what's being built?

Jason Lemkin (01:10:19):
I think, in the best run B2B organizations that I've worked with, and my own as well, the great, at least the head of product, the VP of Products, are deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. A company I invested in that's just crossing $60 million, they just had a meeting with who will be their largest customer. And the head of product who was there at the board meeting is like, "Thank God I was there because what they want to do with our product, we sort of do. We sort of." Now, the product does do it, but what they want to basically do is deconstruct the product. They don't actually want to use the backend and analytics and some other pieces, but they don't really need the front end of the product. If the head of product hadn't been there, that deal would've been lost. It would've been lost.

(01:11:11):
An AE doesn't know that. Even if an AE did know that, a sales rep did know that even. If the VP of Sales didn't know ... A VP of Sales would not be empowered enough to stand up in a meeting and say, "I know what you want. We can launch tomorrow on this and, in 90 days, we'll tweak the UI so it does exactly what you want." You want that in your big deals. If you have that magical VP of Product that truly owns the roadmap, owns it and has the gravitas for that meeting, they become like the mini CEO in these meetings. A lot of CEOs, at scale, I've talked to, I was just talking with Daniel Chait at Greenhouse, he does this, they're over $200 million, when they have that head of product, they divide and conquer with the big customers. And the CEO can do some and the VP of product can do others.

(01:11:52):
And sometimes, the VP of Eng, if they're very producty, can also do that role too. Sometimes, you get these three weapons. In the old days, sometimes, your VP of Customer Success could do this, but unfortunately, and I know this is going to trigger some people, I don't see customer success stepping up for this pseudo product role anymore and I see them shrinking more and more into process. But that magical VP product, they give you that scale, that CEO level scale.

(01:12:17):
Can a product manager or a director do that? In my experience, the best ones, absolutely. The mid-pack ones that are working on the color of the pixel, I'd rather not have them in the deal. You have to be utterly fluent in the product, the entire product. You have to be the one that knows how to connect the pieces that don't ought to always connect themselves, and you have to have the gravitas to work with a large customer, to make commitments. That deep knowledge and commitment, it's hard below the VP level, but if it does exist, I love it. They become one of the greatest strategic weapons of a B2B company is bringing the product team, because the VP of Sales never quite goes that deep and can't make the commits, and the CEO can't be everywhere.

Lenny (01:13:04):
The bane of many product managers' existence is the flip side of sales is involvement in product. Do you have any advice for how you've seen the best SaaS companies handle requests from sales going into product, how product teams should think about requests from sales and making that work?

Jason Lemkin (01:13:21):
I think this one is so simple and I'm surprised people make it so complicated. I know we all release 28 times a day, but the reality is, software still goes on quarterly release cycles no matter what we say, okay? Your customers cannot process 88 releases a day, okay? The maximum a customer can process is two big releases a year and maybe quarterly, so let's simplify. That's how customers think. Forget about how we build software.

(01:13:46):
Every quarter, give your head of sales a certain budget, whether it's story points or 10% of the pie chart, however you do it, give them a budget. And when you do this, things will radically change then. They radically change because even the best VPs of sales, they change the wind. On Monday, what they really need is the HubSpot integration. And they're like, "Oh, my god. We weren't going to do that for two years, but I guess we could change everything on Monday," but then, on Wednesday, a new prospect comes in and, "We need SAP, but we just spent two days spec-ing out." You need SAP. And then, on Monday, it's Salesforce, right? And it's not that sales isn't honest, it's just, the big deals, the big ones always, the tail's wagging the dog and it burns out the organization. Even with the best sales leaders, I find it burns out, especially because the stressful deals, they overreact, and as good as they are, they're not product people, so they don't really know how to prioritize and force rank. If you say, "Okay, Lenny, my VP of Sales, great. HubSpot, SAP, whatever you want, you've got 10% of the budget, you've got a hundred story points, whatever metric or heuristic you use, but you've got to decide now each quarter." And if you want to change during the course of the quarter, if you want to disrupt our whole engineering product team, you can do it, but understand there's a high cost, and the later you do it in the quarter, the less successful it's going to be because we already started the HubSpot integration. Not only will it demoralize the team, but we're going to run out of ... You already used your budget.

(01:15:10):
I just don't see enough product leaders being objective here, saying, "Listen, here's your budget. You get it, period. No one can take it from you. I guess the CO can steal it if she really wants to, but it's yours, VP of Sales." And they will do the low balancing across their team. They will do it. They will listen and they'll say, "Maybe I don't need that HubSpot integration after all. Maybe." Right?

(01:15:32):
Because what a VP of Sales should be doing is taking ... The CO has to look five years into the future, product has to look about two years into the future, and you really can't ask a VP of Sales to look more than 12 months into the future because that's where they're next on the line, but a good one will load balance feature requests across the year and they will listen to all the ... Because they'll actually be in sales, they'll actually be in deals, and they'll be listening and they'll realize, look, even though we're going to lose this deal to HubSpot, I've gotten four SAP requests the last ... I'm going to take that bet. Even if I'm wrong, I'm going to take that bet. You got to give them that ... And you got to talk about it every week and say, "Look, here's your budget, Jane. Here's your story points, your whatever, your 10%. This is what we're building now for you, objectively, and this is what we're currently planning for the next two quarters. Would you like to change the ones for the next two quarters? Because we haven't committed any code yet, and if you really want to change what's in process, you can. Otherwise, it's going to be hyper disruptive," but you got to at least pretend to be objective, for sales.

(01:16:29):
If you're too emotional about it, you break the organization. You've got to say, "Listen, I know we've already written 80% of this upside integration. If you really need us to put us on the shelf and drop everything for a million dollar deal, we're a startup, we'll do it. But understand, just, is this really really what you want?" And if you involve them every week as a stakeholder, magic happens. But I don't see the VPs of Product that I work with, I know I'm not in all the staff meetings, but the meetings I'm in and the board meetings, I don't see this back and forth happening.

Lenny (01:16:58):
This might be the same exact answer you just gave, but say you're a PM and a salesperson comes to you, "Hey, we're about to close this deal. We just need this one feature. Can we just get this on the roadmap?," what's the best way to help that sales person understand why it's not happening, help them feel like, "Okay, I get it"? Is it exactly what just said? "Okay, we could change everything. Here's the story points you have this quarter."

Jason Lemkin (01:17:18):
Well, are you assuming that PM is the head of product or empowered enough to make the decisions?

Lenny (01:17:24):
I'd say, yeah, that PM could put something on the roadmap if they think it's important.

Jason Lemkin (01:17:29):
The reason I'm a little confused, just because I want to get it right, is what I'm hearing, which maybe isn't what you said. What I'm hearing is, a junior IC rep is talking to a more mid-level product person about the roadmap, and you want to have that. That's one of the reasons we actually go to the office. Because those discussions don't happen on Zoom, Lenny. They don't happen. And you want those discussions to happen, but you don't actually want them empowered. You want them to say, "Listen, I will talk to my boss." That's the right answer. It's too confusing.

(01:17:58):
This stress between product and sales is a good thing. It's a sign of a well-run B2B company when there is stress between product and sales. It's a good sign. If there's no stress, you're not in enough deals. You're not in enough deals if there's no stress. But the stress has to have enough process, even in a startup, that it doesn't break because your question alludes to the fact it can break organizations again and again. People get people resented on either side.

(01:18:27):
This is one thing where the answer has to be, "Look, we can chat about it over lunch. We can chat about this, and actually, you've got a good idea. You're an individual contributor. I'm going to tell my boss, on Monday, that I think we should do that. I'm going to use a little social capital and say we should do this," but you got to push the decisions up. That's as far as you're going to make recommendations. Otherwise, instead of that one stressful conversation with the VP, you've got a hundred, you've got 10 times a hundred, and again, they're fun lunch conversations, but they'll wreck you.

Lenny (01:18:54):
So the advice there is, basically, "Talk to your manager, I'll talk to my manager. They need to hash this out. It's not my call."

Jason Lemkin (01:19:00):
I think you got to push it up and I think you got to force the VP of Sales and the VP of Product to have this weekly meeting about the budget, and that will force them to have enough, just enough organization on their team so that it can all be surfaced up. Because that means they each have to have a meeting with their team for 30 minutes each week and say, "I'm going to put up on the whiteboard guys, so my sales team's going to say ... And I've been to many of these meetings where you force the sales team to force rank what they want and you end up, I tell you, Lenny, 100% of the time in the sales meeting, when you do a whiteboard force rank, you end up walking out with very different outputs than when you start the meeting in sales 100% of the time.

(01:19:36):
On the product side, you need to do the converse. You just need to say, "We owe sales 10% of our points, so in our team meeting, we're going to put in 15 minutes of our team meeting and we're going to make sure we have the priorities right from the sales team. Let's go over what I got from Linda. This is what she says. Is she wrong? Should we do something? How can we help the sales team be even more successful? And what inputs is the team hearing?" And they can raise their hand and say, "Look, I just had this all the way conversation with Bobby, but honestly, Lenny, I can build a HubSpot integration in a day." "What? I thought it was really hard." "No, I did it my last company. And listen, actually, we can actually outsource it to Bob and Linda at this agency I know for 20 grand. They'll build it next week." That's a magical moment. That's a magical moment. But you've got to each have these parallel meetings. The good thing, that tension can become debilitating. We've all seen those fights, those almost fights that break out, and they come from a place of passion, but you got to have structure.

Lenny (01:20:30):
Great advice. Another trend I've been noticing is that product teams are taking on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals. What's your sense of, is that good? Is that bad? How do you think about that for product teams?

Jason Lemkin (01:20:42):
You want everyone to be aligned on the big picture revenue goal for the end of the year. Is the question, you mean having financial bonuses and stuff tied to hitting the plan?

Lenny (01:20:51):
More that their KPIs and their OKRs are essentially this much revenue, you need to drive this much revenue from your experiments, from your product launches.

Jason Lemkin (01:21:00):
As you can see, I have a lot of opinions on things here that are data-driven and they're live experience. This one, I need another year in the oven, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. What happened in the last 18 months is, in customer success, which is, in the old days, it was related to product. Now, it's less so, which I think is unfortunate. In customer success, in the last 18 months, this happened all across the industry. 24 months ago, customer success's goal was happy customers, measured in retention, sometimes NRR, net retention with upsells, sometimes with GRR, just logos, how many logos. That was your only job, happy customers. Happy customers.

(01:21:35):
Then, things got harder in many areas of B2B, and every customer success team last year, their goal was revenue. You need to bring in more revenue from existing base, and it destroyed customer relationships. There is a leading public company, I will not name them, I'm a positive guy. I will tell you, a company we all have used for years and loved, and they did this to their customer success team. And they came to us last year, we paid $299 a month for this product for our team. They asked us for $50,000 upfront or said they would turn it off that day. That week. Maybe it was that week. $50,000. That's what happens when you weaponize ...

(01:22:10):
So customer success, and I know this is going to trigger some people, but it is true, when I talk to leaders, customer success got weaponized and I don't like it, okay? I don't like it as a product. All founders are product people, I think. I don't like it as a product because I think it's bad for customers. That experience I got was horrific, wasn't it? That $50,000, being told. And it got walked back. And the fact that it got walked back is almost even worse because it wasn't true. It was a threat. So do I want to weaponize the product team? I want the product team aligned with revenue. These are the tough decisions for founders. But I think we're going to regret, to some extent, weaponizing teams that we don't need to weaponize.

(01:22:50):
Having said that, I will tell you, and again, no knock on Adobe, but when I was a VP at Adobe, and it was a long time ago, when product was in another building, in some cases, that was not great. And I love Scott and the whole team, it was a great experience, but I can just tell you, what I learned is, that did not work for me as an agile guy, having groups that would do this work in isolation.

(01:23:08):
And the problem was they would never talk to a customer. So I know I want product constantly talking to the customer. I know I want the VP of product with a lot of equity, wanting to hit the bookings number for the year. Do I want your average PM weaponized and forced to bring in revenue from an experimental feature when everyone agreed it's the test we're going to run? We only can run so many. You say, should they have revenue for new feature launches, for new product expansions, for new things? Yes, but everyone's got to make that decision. There aren't that many of us that have 1,000 extra engineers sitting around with nothing to do.

(01:23:44):
Even the smallest experiment, no matter what it says on the internet, again, that we release 100 a day, I would argue bringing any product extension to market's very expensive and risky because you're taking away from something else. These are expensive decisions, and if you punish people for the mistakes in product, this is something that big companies are actually better at than startups, which is, they don't fire you if the new initiative fails. Because then, no one at a big company would ever join the new initiative. There are exceptions, but no one at Adobe or Google would work on the new product if you got fired if it didn't hit $100 million its first year.

(01:24:21):
One thing I saw that was very, and I don't know how to bring to startups in my big company experience, was it's liberating to some extent to let people fail, up to a point. It's liberating. Because the cost of failure in a startup is so high. It's just so high. I know that's not what the exact question, and ask me in a year, but my advice is, just be careful that you don't weaponize functions.

Lenny (01:24:44):
I probably should have clarified. I think this is mostly true in PLG companies where most of the growth is coming from product, but I imagine the advice is still the same, as be careful putting too much pressure on the product team to focus on revenue.

Jason Lemkin (01:24:55):
Well, that's how you get dark stuff. Back in the day, I remember my sister worked at Vistaprint for online business cards, and her entire job was to force people to buy upsell of additional products on the checkout page they didn't want to buy. That was her whole job. And she was paid a large variable comp to get people to buy third party products without realizing in their checkout, and it worked. That's all she did for three years was figure out dark stuff, I mean, darkish, grayish stuff so that when I bought my business card, I also bought GoDaddy and 11 other things that I didn't want. It works, but it doesn't create high NPS, does it?

Lenny (01:25:34):
Mm-hmm. No.

Jason Lemkin (01:25:34):
The thing is, here's the thing that you have to think about. What's crazy, Lenny, now, and I talk to a lot of these folks is, there's so many SaaS companies that are a billion or more in revenue. I just wrote up, there's just Pimcore, which is SaaS for [inaudible 01:25:49]. I just wrote up, it just crossed a billion in revenue. So many folks are at a billion. CloudFlare just crossed a billion. And the only way you can do that is if your revenue compounds.

(01:25:59):
And in fact, just myself, I just interviewed Matt Mullen from WordPress, 20 years he's been doing this, and he said the number one thing he didn't understand at WordPress, at Automatic, was the power of compounding. When you do these things that are customer hostile, and a lot of us were under stress this last 12 days, to hit the numbers, right? This is your job as founders, is you got to load balance the fact that the cash has to last and my investors are mad with me, but nothing matters in B2B that it compounds. And some of this dark stuff you're talking about on PLG, it anti-compounds, right?

(01:26:30):
And I would say, let me flip it around. The magical thing at the high level that it compounds, if you have a self-service model, a PLG model, I actually think the number one most important metric is churn. It's going to this churn, churn, churn, churn. And when I meet any startup for investing or anything, if the churn is not top decile for a low end product, I'm always out. It's almost unsolvable. It's almost unsolvable. This 3% to 4% a month churn rate that a lot of SMB stuff, it's almost unsolvable. I think that's where the energy should go, is relentlessly bringing down churn so that, 20 years from now, we all have billion dollar AR companies. That's what we want.

Lenny (01:27:11):
I have a rapid fire set of questions before, actually, the lightning round. We'll see if we have time for all these things. I just have a bunch of random questions that I'm going to fire at you and and see what comes up. Sounds good? Okay, cool. I got a thumbs up. Let's do it. Okay.

(01:27:23):
What is just one thing a founder or product leader can do to become better at sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:27:28):
The number one thing they can do, and this is very tactical, at the end of each meeting, because again, both of them are good middlers, the head of product and the founders are good demos, they're good at talking shop, they're good at talking in the industry, they're good at talking workflows. Learn. This is the only school you have to learn. Even if you're not comfortable asking for money, learn to ask for what's the next step, Lenny. This is what all great salespeople have learned to do. Actually, mediocre salespeople are terrible at this. The best salespeople never leave a meeting without a next step. The next step does not have to be a check. Don't break the relationship, but what's the next meeting? The next meeting might be, "Lenny, is there someone else at your company that I could do a demo for?" People are lazy, they don't want to do multiple demos.

(01:28:06):
But in 2024, we all have to demo multiple stakeholders. In 2021, it was one stakeholder. Now, it's a four-stakeholder sale. If you don't know what to ask at the end of the call, ask, "Who else? Lenny, is there someone else? I know you're excited to buy our product, but who else? Is there someone else in the organization? Can I help you? Can I just do a demo?" A demo is not threatening. Whatever the next step is, "What's the next step we can get on our books?" And listen. The best salespeople march deals step by step by step by step. And then, they put in the time. They've done the demos, they've done the pilot if they need to, they've helped them get going, they've helped them see the value. And then, if it takes six steps to say, "Okay, Lenny, now, we've got five folks at the organization using it. They've seen, here's the deal. They love it. What can we do, Lenny, to get going? Can we get a contract signed so we can get going on February 1st?" It's just very natural.

(01:28:56):
And founders just end the Zoom. They end the zoom, and they wait. They wait in their inbox for the next step to come, but it doesn't, it rarely comes on its own. That's the number one tip is, make sure yourself and you log it in your CRM that you always have a next step after. You don't have to be great at sales. As long as you're moving the ball down the field, then, get it into the red zone, and then, figure out how to ask for the money. But you don't have to ask for the money until it's in the red zone.

Lenny (01:29:21):
Amazing. While we're on this topic, is there a book or a course or anything that you'd just recommend folks go to get better at sales? Just, is there some tactical, "Go read this thing, it'll help you?" Or is it just, it's hard, you're not going to figure it out reading a book?

Jason Lemkin (01:29:35):
I am a voracious reader. If I only wanted to plug myself, and I usually wouldn't, two things that we have, we have something called SaaStr.University. SaaStr dot University. It's free. There's a pretty good course on learning about sales. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. It just organizes a lot of the stuff we're talking about and it's free. I think it's pretty helpful. We actually wrote a book called From Impossible To Inevitable that sold about 100,000 copies.

Lenny (01:29:59):
Oh, wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:29:59):
I did almost none of the work, although a lot of is my content. Aaron Ross did it. It's actually really good, and it interviews a lot of top sales leaders and goes through a lot of stuff we did. I don't usually hype it, but for 15 bucks, I think this ... And actually, I've never made one dollar. I've never even gotten a check for these 100,000 copies, but I do think it's actually ... The second edition's pretty good. I think, if you like what we're talking about, the SaaS University and the others. I just hyped my own course, which is free. I don't think I'm selling something if it's free. The book, I don't make a dollar on. I'd be very cautious, and this is tough, maybe this is something we can work on together. There's so many courses and so many people selling stuff the last two years. Just be cautious. Just be cautious.

(01:30:39):
The last thing I will say is, there is another community called Pavilion, and I do think it's great, Pavilion. It does have a lot of networking and stuff for sales and connecting sales with founders, and I am a super fan of what they're doing. That one's worth investing. But be careful about Bob and John's sales courses on the internet. There's too many.

Lenny (01:31:00):
Awesome. All right. We'll link to all those things in the show notes.

(01:31:03):
Next question, what is the ideal trial length for a free trial for sales team? Is it 14 days, a month, years? What do you recommend?

Jason Lemkin (01:31:11):
Tomas Tsangaris did a whole SaaStr presentation just on free trials and free trial legs. It was really good, but the one thing you didn't know, which I know just being an old timer is, one of the reasons we have 14-day trials on the internet is, in the old days, the Salesforce sales team, when they were SMB focused, wanted to close deals that month, so they forced Salesforce to move from 30 to 14 days. There was no evidence it was better for the customer. There was no evidence that it got usage going or people ... They just wanted to close deals the same month.

(01:31:41):
That's something to be cautious about, these metrics. And be cautious, since we're talking to product folks, be cautious that they're customer centric. Salesforce is very enterprise now, but in the old days, it pushed it to 14 days so the sales reps could close deals faster. What we learned from Slack and Zoom until recently was infinite trials work pretty good. So does Canva. Slack and Canva, and until recently, Zoom, were okay waiting four years to convert. And those are epic companies. Those are epic companies.

(01:32:12):
And these are one of the things that only founders can make these decisions. I wrote this post years ago saying, "Who's your VP of Free?" Because who's got a VP of Free? Do you know anybody that has a VP of Free? I got a VP of Growth, I got a VP of Product, but if you have this massive free base, who's your VP of Free? I know almost no one that has a VP of Free. And usually, it's some kind of collaboration between product and the CEO. They're the VP of Free, but even then, you need a VP of Free, and we don't have one. There's no perfect answers, but in a world where we're tightening nooses everywhere on trials, we're tightening nooses everywhere, be careful the advice you get, be careful the short-term advice.

(01:32:49):
For example, another related terrible piece of advice VCs give you is switch to annual contracts. This is terrible advice. Terrible advice, Lenny. Terrible advice from people who've never built products and aren't in the field. Going to annual contracts, on a spreadsheet, looks great. On a spreadsheet-

Jason Lemkin (01:33:00):
Going to annual contracts on a spreadsheet looks great. On a spreadsheet, it looks great. You know what's better? Letting customers pay what they want to pay. If it's you or me buying for ourselves, Lenny, we're still going to put it on a credit card, aren't we? If it's our own personal... And we want to pay monthly, usually, we don't know. We usually want to just try it monthly. Big companies want to pay annually because they have procurement departments. Why force people to go the way they don't want to go? So, just start, this is a product audience. Product needs to be the voice of the customer. It's not so much customer success as it used to be. It's not so much sales. You've got to be the voice of the customer together with the founders and push these things.

(01:33:39):
Think about, I would do the longest possible trial that is still customer-centric and understand there's tension. Understand there's tension, right? I say anytime I'm in a board meeting where some VC says, "Let's do annual for an SMB." I mean, I'm like, "No. Show me the money. Show me the evidence that this is better for the customer." Right? How many times have you gone to buy something for yourself and it's 19 bucks a month? And that's annoying because it's an [inaudible 01:34:05] credit card charge. But do you want to pay 240 up front? I mean, maybe you do it for a Riverside or something you use all the time, but some random product you just discovered, you're just going to bounce.

Lenny (01:34:14):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:34:14):
So, who's going to show the data in the bounce, right? A related point for like in sales. No one does enough. Everyone does these win-loss meetings, but no one talks enough about the deals they lost. Everyone talks about the deals they won. All the lore, the tribal lore in sales is how we won the deal. People should be spending more time talking about deals they lost than the deals they won, right? And same thing for this PLG motion. If you make your... Yes, I give everyone a pass for 2023, everyone whose growth plummeted and did things they shouldn't. Did price increases they didn't earn, cut the free trials, hid their free editions. I'm going to give you, look, you've got to give your team a little stress relief, right? So, I'm giving every person I work with, every portfolio, everyone a one-year pass, but the past is in the past. We got to get back to being customer-centric and building businesses that build to 1 billion ARR on their own because they're wonderful businesses that are product-centric, right? That recur. And every time you rip a customer off, you lose, the relationship's damaged, isn't it?

(01:35:21):
And a controversial thing I say to the product team, but I think this is the right thing if you're going long, is look, everyone raised prices last year, as you know, right? Everyone raised prices. The question I ask folks is, "Did you earn it?" What feature did you [inaudible 01:35:36]? If you raised prices 8% last year, did you add 30% more value to your product? In the old days pre these crazy years, the answer usually was yes. People would wait up, they would wait a couple years, right? And the whatever product from four years ago was so much better. It really was. Really had earned 1995 instead of... Last year, no one earned their price increases. No one came out with an amazing new edition, an amazing new functionality that earned it. They just sent you an email saying, "You're paying more." So we get one pass, but earn it. Earn your price increase.

(01:36:12):
Have the longest free trial possible. Own it. And this VP of free thing, it's got to be founders working with product because no one else cares about the free. You can't expect the sales team to care about free, can you? You can't expect the marketing team to care about free. Unless they can immediately monetize them, right? Unless they can ram them into conversion. People abuse their long tail in the last 18 months, but your long tail is... These are your... Even if they don't convert that much, they're your advocates. I mean, how many people read your newsletter? 500,000 people, right?

Lenny (01:36:42):
Almost 600,000.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:42):
Okay. 600,000. Now, not all of them convert, do they?

Lenny (01:36:46):
No, no. That's exactly how I look at it. It's kind of this Brian Belfort is this... Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:49):
What about the 590,000 of them that love Lenny that don't convert, right?

Lenny (01:36:49):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:53):
If you over monetize them, then Lenny's community doesn't exist if you over monetize them. But when you bring in a VP of sales for Lenny and a VP of growth and... You can't expect them to care as much about that long tail as you, right?

Lenny (01:37:10):
I love your passion around this. So, what I'm hearing partly is you're a big fan of freemium, essentially, right? And the benefits of product-led growth where there's something you could just use indefinitely, or do you still think that's a trial where it needs to end at some point? Or is it just like, "No, freemium is great in a lot of cases."

Jason Lemkin (01:37:26):
Listen, I'm a big fan of long tails when they work. They don't always work for enterprise products. I'm a big fan of delivering more value than you take out for your customers. And I am a big fan overall of free, because, and I know you'll agree with me this, every founder figures this out at some point, free products are better software. Products that cannot offer a free edition cut corners because they don't have to be good at onboarding. The products that do not have a free edition have human beings that bridge the gap between buying and deployment. And that's okay at ServiceNow, and that's okay in certain products, but the best products invest the engineering cycles to have a free edition. Whether that's truly free, whether it's an extended free trial, whether it's a long tail or a medium tail, the amount of... All of your product is better if people can actually, if you have a free edition, all your customers benefit, even your enterprise customers benefit, they all benefit.

Lenny (01:38:28):
This idea of VP of free, I think technically it's probably the head of growth for a PLG company or the person leading the self-serve part of the business.

Jason Lemkin (01:38:36):
But even in the organizations I work with that have those structures, that person is focused on monetizing that tail. Who stands up for the 590,000 other readers of Lenny? Who's their champion?

Lenny (01:38:50):
Yeah, and you're 100% right. That's exactly how I think about the newsletter. There's this free audience and ideas over time, they get convinced, "This is worth my money and let's give it a shot."

Jason Lemkin (01:38:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:38:59):
So, yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:39:00):
And your growth person, let's say 1% converts. I'm just making that up. Going from 1 to 1.1 actually is a big deal at that scale or 1.2, right? That's okay. But you've got to nurture the 490,000, not spend all the calories just ramming the paid edition through, right? But only it's a fun thing, because once you hit a little bit of scale, this is part of your job as founders and product leaders is who's going to be this VP of free? It's not growth. I don't think it's the growth team or something. They got to hit their goal when their goal is to get another half million out of the newsletter this year. And that's their bonuses side to it. You think they're going to work on the free ones? No chance.

Lenny (01:39:43):
Makes sense. Oh man, there's so many things I can go into and want to go into. I also want to let you go. So with that, is there anything else, Jason, that you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Anything you want to leave listeners with?

Jason Lemkin (01:39:59):
I think just make this the year of the customer guys. And I really think that sales has been under so much pressure the last 18 months. Customer success has changed. Product teams have to step up. This is your time to do great things this year as product people. Be the voice of the customer. Be the VP of free, be the whatever. Be the champion. Stick your neck out. Work harder, folks. Work harder. The funnest part of anything in startups is working hard, but in product it's extra fun. By working harder, you have the more fun conversations. Find the delight in... The delight in product is making customers happy. It's not worth it otherwise. Otherwise, it's drudgery and it's endless PRDs and Gantt charts and mindless discussions. Make your customers happier this year, you will be happy. This is the year of product and we all get a pass for whatever bad deeds we did or mediocre deeds we did in 2023, get back and be the vanguard in your companies.

(01:40:53):
Startups need, and bigger companies, they need someone to inject energy again, in many cases. Energy has been lost. And it would be great if product can do it and say, "Listen, let's do something, even if we're not exactly sure how to get more leads, okay? Even if we're not exactly sure what to do, there's one thing under our control is the code we write and the product we ship. Let's do three great things this year. Let's just do them not good, great. Let's do three great." And what you'll find is the whole company will respond, including sales, including marketing, including... If we start shipping great thing. Few things inspire teams more than when you're shipping great products. So, be... If you weren't the leaders the last two years, if you were being forced to weaponize your customer base somehow ship three great things this year. That's my challenge. Ship three great things.

Lenny (01:41:39):
I love this. This is the year of product, that might be the title of this podcast.

Jason Lemkin (01:41:42):
Yes.

Lenny (01:41:44):
Jason, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jason Lemkin (01:41:50):
Okay. I'm worried about the first one, but go for it.

Lenny (01:41:52):
They're very non-surprising, because they're always the same. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:00):
That's the one I just want to take a pass on. I know they're the same. I read more than anybody else in the planet, but I wish I had those two great, great books that have changed my mind in the last 12 months, but hopefully I've added some value. But this one, I think I got to take a mulligan on it [inaudible 01:42:14] perfect answer.

Lenny (01:42:15):
Acceptable answer. Is there a favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoy?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:20):
Oh, the Terminal List.

Lenny (01:42:22):
The Terminal List?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:24):
The Terminal List, yeah. I'm not into the Chris Pratt. I'm not into that goofy superhero movies he does, and I know people like it, but The Terminal List, it's pretty, it's I got it, it's written by this ex Navy SEAL that I think tech people don't read the... Everyone, but outside of tech reads this author, but Amazon did this thing with The Terminal List and I think the reason it gripped me, it's like this post, it's like a lot of tech is right now is we're trying to do the right things, but are we doing the right things? It's just confusing. So this one, I couldn't put down, The Terminal List. That was my favorite show. The other one, the one I liked that I couldn't believe. You want the second one? Even though as product people, Maverick, and I'll tell you why. This movie Maverick, okay, you wouldn't think I'd be a Maverick guy, but the quality of this product, it was so high.

(01:43:18):
And what's interesting, you remember Maverick was supposed to come out before COVID, right? And Tom Cruise said no. He's like, "This is such a good product, we're going to wait years for this thing to come out." I'm like, " I'm not going to like this. I mean, cocktail was pretty good, but I'm not going to..." But as a product, when... I've watched this movie three times from a product perspective and just like software, when something is done that well, no wasted calories, no... You see everything tied together. That's the kind of software we love, right? It just delights us when it works better than we expected. So, those are my two.

Lenny (01:43:53):
You also did all his own stunts, which I think is a good metaphor for the VP of product, maybe being involved in sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:43:57):
Actually do the work.

Lenny (01:43:59):
Yeah, exactly. Oh man, I'm stretching it. Okay, next question. You answered a few of these already, but do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing salespeople, especially?

Jason Lemkin (01:44:09):
I answered it, but I'll bring it up again in case you do it again, is, "What do you want to do your first 14 days to head of product or head of sales? What do you want to do your first 14 days?" It's not a technical 30-day plan, you don't have to do 28 slides. It's what I call a Colombo question. Not that I really watch Colombo, but Colombo is this old detective on TV who, I don't know if you ever, he would ask these dumb questions, right? And then the murderer would thought Colombo was so dumb, but by the end of the episode he'd always incriminate himself because the question. So, when I interview, I always do Colombo questions. They're never tough ones, right? They're always nice. I don't know if I'm nice, I'm honest, but the interview [inaudible 01:44:42]. But Lenny, what would you do your first 14 days as VP of product here? And they don't want to visit customers. Don't hire them for either all sales or product. Just don't hire them.

Lenny (01:44:51):
I've got the answer now. That's exactly what I was going to say. Next question, what is a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?

Jason Lemkin (01:45:00):
My two aren't really amazing, but I'll answer them. I love this Opus Clip app for making clips from video. I know you have a whole team, so you probably don't need it, but I produce a lot. I mean, a lot of us do content marketing, right? Whoever does it. I produce a lot of content. I don't have enough time to do this. So, the only AI tool that I've found helpful so far is Opus Clip, which takes all of the incredible amount of YouTube content we have, force ranks it and turns it into 59 second clips. And I'm a case study on the website, I tried the earlier products. They were almost there, right? But it's not, is it as good as a clip team? Right? Is it? No.

(01:45:41):
But literally in 60 seconds, what's interesting is it can do something, I don't have time to, I could never make YouTube clips. I could never make Instagram shorts. I could never make... It just would never happen, right? It would never happen. And the fact that one product enables you to do something at a minimum viable quality you couldn't do before, I'm a super fan. It's pretty interesting. So, that's my favorite. And my other one is this one. This is the folding phone that's finally as good as a normal phone. See, there's The Terminal List that I've got folded up and it just works.

Lenny (01:46:11):
That's wild. [inaudible 01:46:12].

Jason Lemkin (01:46:12):
Weighs the same as an iPhone.

Lenny (01:46:13):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:13):
And so the reason it's cool is this has changed the way I do productivity. One Plus, it's the One Plus. One Plus, yeah, it's the first one that's the same form factor, same weight, same... So there's really no, there's no loss, right? And I can use my normal phone here like I'm using, it's a little funky, but it's the same... And then to be able to do content, to be able to check, to be able to do full email, full account, full everything like an iPad.

Lenny (01:46:39):
We see your Tesla where it's going, that gets parked. That's very cool. So, it's basically like an iPad plus a phone in one.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:47):
Yeah, I probably use this 50% of the time of the iPad.

Lenny (01:46:50):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:50):
So, that's it. That is it. The other ones that-

Lenny (01:46:52):
And that's an Android?

Jason Lemkin (01:46:53):
... Make sense to me. Yeah, it's a Android, yeah.

Lenny (01:46:55):
Amazing. I had not seen that. That is extremely cool.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:55):
Very cool.

Lenny (01:46:58):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Jason Lemkin (01:47:07):
It's, "Be kind." When I reflect on my career, right? Mistakes, I don't think I'm mean. I actually think I care more than most people on the planet. I like to think I've helped a lot of people, but it's not taking the time to be kind at times and not taking time to be kind when things don't work out. Not taking time to be kind when you leave a situation. Not taking time to be kind when maybe someone's done the wrong thing, right? Not taking time to be kind to a customer that leaves, right? I remember in the early days of Adobe Sign of EchoSign, we had a top tech customer, and I killed myself to close this customer, right? Famous, huge, huge tech company today. And then our champion changed, right? Champion changed is the big issue in software and product and came in and brought in DocuSign instead of us.

(01:47:56):
And man, I was just so mad. I just tore into this guy. This guy had actually had dinner at my house, right? And he actually never, he just did it because it was good for his own career, right? And I was so mad, but I broke the relationship forever, right? That's just one random example. And I just think there's so much advice to fire fast and to be relentless and do all these things, right? But you've interviewed so many people, Lenny, right? I mean so many great leaders. I haven't done what you've done, but I've talked to almost all the top CEOs in SaaS, okay? And they're kind. It doesn't mean that they're soft, they're not soft, okay? They make tough decisions every day, but they're kind. And so in this world where everyone feels like they're getting ripped off or they're not paid enough, or I want founder pay for founder work, this motto, really it's troubling.

(01:48:51):
Everyone is founder pay for founder... "You want me to work more than 30 hours, Lenny? I need 30% of the company. I need founder pay for founder work." It's like, I hear you. But you'll find that by being totally committed, going to 110% and also finding a way to be kind, that will endure across your whole career. So, I know it's... Because I think I'm good, but not always kind. It's how I challenge myself all the time. Be kinder in that conversation. And the big epiphany, we already talked about it, it shouldn't have taken me this long to realize that anytime an employee fails, it's your fault, be kind. You hired them. They never knew what they were getting themselves into. If the job's too hard, if they lack the skills, if there's not enough budget, if there's not enough people, if it requires too many hours to work, you should have known that. Not them. Be kind. Be kind to every single person on your team that doesn't work out. That's not just putting together an email spreadsheet and sending it out. Try, try harder. Be there for them. Be kind.

Lenny (01:49:44):
Be kind. I love this. I know that you actually, your username on Twitter includes, "Be kind." In your actual-

Jason Lemkin (01:49:51):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:52):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
So, you really back this up. Amazing. Okay, final question. You're on a giant conference, SaaStr.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:58):
Yes.

Lenny (01:49:59):
First of all, just talk about what it is so people know and explore it and check it out. But the actual question is what would surprise people most about running a conference like this? Things that they know, think about it goes into running a conference like this.

Jason Lemkin (01:50:13):
Any business, no matter how weird it is, that's at scale, the best one in it, it's always interesting, I think for case studies, right? The best, pick anything, the best cup maker, whoever it is, whoever makes the best... This is not an interesting business, the Starbucks cup on its own, but the best person, I pretty much guarantee you there's a good story there, right? SaaStr is a community as well like you have. We started this really early in 2011, 2012 for B2B founders back when that seemed like a weird thing to do. Now it doesn't seem so weird. So, we built a lot of content and we started doing events and meetups. I never did a meetup. You do a lot of meetups, but when I did meetups, I'd never actually even been to one. So, I did meetups in 2012 and 2013, but 1,000 people came to the meetups.

(01:50:56):
That will make sense to you today, but a decade ago for B2B, it was pretty, people were like, "Why are all these people here? We thought there was six of us that cared about B2B." So, then we did a big event. We did a one-day SaaStr annual in 2015, and 3000 people came including the evening. And so we just kept going. So, we get about 10 to 12,000 people together a year. What that means is change. It's no longer novel. I'm not the only person producing B2B content anymore. I'm not the only founder that sold their company like in the old days. There's plenty much more successful founders and better, I certainly, I don't do very many podcasts, because I'm not a hundredth as good as you. I do one a quarter, for example.

(01:51:34):
But the events have become this meeting place for founders that have hit scale, that are somewhere between 1 million and 20 million. And especially folks that aren't in Silicon Valley, especially folks that aren't sitting in Hayes Valley or wherever, that don't have a community. And that surprised me in the beginning how many international folks would fly all the way to the Bay Area. I remember this founder came from Perth, Australia for the first afternoon. I'm like, "Thanks for coming, but this is a lot of work." He is like, "I didn't come for you. I came because there's no one like me in Perth." So, it's taken on a life of its own. There's a lot of learnings. I think, I didn't intend to do mass scale events. I intended to just do meetups, because I had a community like you do meetups. So, it was absolutely an accident. The learnings are, it's extremely expensive and it has this weird curve. Okay, that's this weird curve where, and this is more because I think actually all founders, all startups should be doing events for their own customers, at least steak dinners I've written about. You should get your customers, if you get your customers and prospects together, you sell more. Get your customers and... It does not need to be a million dollar or 10 million event. It can be Roots Chrises, it can be whatever. It does not even need to be fancy. Just get them together.

Lenny (01:52:39):
It has to be steak though.

Jason Lemkin (01:52:41):
Yeah, well, no, but steak does work. I mean, I'm not a big steak guy. It could be any, just something nice where they want to go. It, just where they want to go. Your customers will sell your prospects for you. Your customers will do the selling for you [inaudible 01:52:53] bring them together.

(01:52:55):
When you do it really small, it's cheap, because how much does that back room cost at the steakhouse, right? It's worth it if you get one big deal out of it, right? And then you graduate and then you'll do a meetup and you'll do it at someone's office. Some tech company, they'll give it to you for free, they have an extra office. That costs nothing, right? And then you're like, "Well, that went well. We got 100, 200 people came to Lenny's thing at Digital Ocean." And then you say, "I'm gonna do an event." And then you rent a theater, a disuse. And these theaters are actually kind of cheap because they're dark during the day. There's not a lot going on and a lot of... Not movie theaters but music. So, those are cheap. But then you're like, "Well, there's only one stage and it smells like beer."

(01:53:34):
So, then the next year you do a hotel and a hotel's pretty expensive. It's like half a million, 800,000 and I hated hotels. But you know what I learned from the business model? It's turnkey landing. So, your marketing manager can call up the Hilton in any city and in two weeks spool up some mediocre AV, some mediocre chicken wings and drinks, okay? And you and I don't like to go to the Hilton that much. The ballroom C, we don't like to go to events [inaudible 01:54:00], but it turns out your customers don't care. They want to be together and talk about your app, right? And then if you do community like you do, you could probably charge a couple $100 for tickets and get some sponsors and bring in some revenue, right? But then after Hilton Ballroom B, it costs $2 million to turn the lights on.

(01:54:16):
And SaaStr annual... So, our Europa event in London's in early June, June fourth to fifth, please come if you want. That costs $2 million to turn the lights on in London. To turn the lights on in the Bay Area for 12,000 people in September in the Bay Area, which is the most expensive place, right? It's $10 million to turn the lights on.

Lenny (01:54:32):
Holy shit.

Jason Lemkin (01:54:34):
It's $10 million to turn the lights on. Now, I'm being a little expansive in what I mean by turn the lights on, but this is what it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you about $1000 per attendee in the Bay Area or Las Vegas to have a mass scale event. Not smaller, not one day in Grand Ballroom B, but a multi-day event, right? The AV is 1.5 million. The food and beverage is 1.5 million. The tenting is $800,000. I can keep going. So, once you get to 20, 30, 40 million in revenue, quietly, there's public companies out there.

(01:55:04):
They have software like Margins at that scale, but before that, it's brutal, right? And when I started doing these events, I interviewed the head of it back before March 2020 when tech companies did their own events, they've pretty much given up, which is an interesting side topic. Big ones like big, not small ones, but big ones. Biden View, the head of events at everyone, right? At Twilio and Marketo and dah, dah. They all be like, "Well, how'd the event go?" It'd all be the same. Well, we brought in about 1.5 million revenue. " Oh, okay." "And we lost 2 million." Everyone lost 2 million. Every single one lost 2 million. And you could see in the financial state, even Zoom at that scale just announced how much money they lose at Zoomtopia. So, it's a terrible business. What I like to say is it has diseconomies of scale. The Lenny's little free meetup costs zero, right? And then the one at Cloudflare's office costs zero.

(01:55:50):
And the one at Hilton B maybe costs $200, but then it costs $1000 per person at scale, right? Even more like Moscone like in San Francisco is probably the most expensive. You're approaching $2,000 per person, because you have to buy about 15 to 20 million of hotel nights to do an event in Moscone, right? So I don't know if that's... We could, I mean it's a side topic, Lenny's side podcast for people that care. But this diseconomies of scale. But there are a handful of public companies that do Lions, Money 2020, Shoptalk, a few others that are at SaaStr scale. And they cobbled together these very profitable public companies. But they all got to do at least 20 to 30 million, because you've got to get over a 10. And it's intimidating to get over a $10 million net, right?

(01:56:33):
And so what it means is we have to spend 14 to 16 months each year planning for SaaStr annual because it's not that fun if you fall six or $8 million behind. That's what happened in March 2020. We were the first major event to be canceled by COVID in March 2020. The first one, RSA happened for security the week before then we got canceled. So, we lost $10 million in one day and it took a long time to dig out of that hole, Lenny, especially since we monetize nothing, it took a long time, but they're worth it.

(01:57:04):
I know you don't do traditional events, but you do do meetups in your community, and I know they're worth it. I know they're worth it. Bringing your customers together, bringing your community together, and we talked about this offline before we started. Second tier, third tier events I do not think are worth it because they do not attract the best people. It's just a fact. Most people, it turns out from our founders are our core ICP. They go to two events a year on average, two events a year, okay? And they'll do other steak dinners. So, if you go to one of the two that they're at, you just might bump into Jeff Lawson or Eric Juan or whoever the next one. They might be there. That might be one of their two, but they don't go to number three through 10. They don't go to these. So, my role in general is people wonder, should I go to events? Is it worth my time? It's a waste of time.

(01:57:49):
And I know you've thought about it. And the irony is, even though we produce events, I used to think that. I didn't want to do events, I just wanted to do meetups, right? I was shy, I just wanted to do meetups. But then I learned over time that the best events bring the best vendors, the best executives, the best everything together. So, pick the one or two best events in your industry. And even if you're antisocial, try to go to one or two a year, go along. It pays off. It pays off, but maybe don't bother with the rest, even if they're ski slopes or they're fun that the subscale, subscale just doesn't work for meeting and marketing to people. It just doesn't work.

Lenny (01:58:25):
I said at the top of this podcast that there's a billion things that we could talk about, and I think that's exactly what happened. We can go in so many directions. And that alone was extremely interesting, because people want me to run a conference and I really don't. And I really enjoy the meetups that we have now. And we actually do have sponsors that cover drinks and food and things like that, and they're very chill, and I really love what happens at those things. But yes, this is really good information. Jason, I have two more questions for you that I ask everyone. I think we went through a couple of these things, but just real quick, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Lemkin (01:59:03):
In general just go to this kooky, URL, SaaStr, saastr.com. That's a way to access a lot of what we're talking about. If they want to reach me to be transparent, I get a lot of impound, like I'm sure you do, to be honest, guys, it is hard to process the amount of inbound that folks get, right? But I'll give you an insider tip. I do see almost all of it. So, if you want to reach me, if you just want an hour of my time randomly, I'm sorry, honestly, I'm sorry, I don't have that hour of time, okay? But if you want to interact lightly, I mean, I'm on Twitter all most days @Jasonlk. I'm on LinkedIn a lot, just search for me, Jason Lemkin. LinkedIn's pretty cool. I have 260,000 followers. We have really good conversations. And I will tell you, if you have a question like you really need some help in your business or you want to do a pitch, if you send me the world's best email pitch, I will read a 100% of them.

(02:00:00):
Track it, put it in Mixmax, put it in HubSpot, put it... You'll see I'll open that email if the title's good. It doesn't mean I can respond. I'm sorry, no, Lenny can't respond, but realize it is going to be read. If you need a favor, like a help, if you ask the question super discreetly like, "Jason, here's the LinkedIn, I'm Lenny. I'm trying to hire this person. I'm at four millionaire doubling. Should I hire her?" There's a chance I'll look at that LinkedIn, I can tell you, or if it's one question, but if it's an hour or coffee, it isn't going to work, but it is going to get read. So, do that by email. Do it even by LinkedIn. I didn't used to read those LinkedIn emails, but if it's really good, I will read it and I probably respond to five or six of them a day.

(02:00:35):
I give to the extent that it's helpful, free answers, free advice. Not that I charge for anything, but make it good. Don't ask for coffee. So, many folks have written this, the most important people in the world read email. It's an open medium, right? And a subset of those folks actually read their social media. Even Elon Musk reads his, before he bought Twitter, he read it. You can access almost anyone in this industry. Just be super strategic about how you do it. Again, put yourself in your shoes. Would you answer this? Would you do this? But I would say half the stuff gets open to read. So, I know that's a rambly answer, but first, we talked about sales. You can reach anybody in the world via email. It's magical.

Lenny (02:01:11):
I'm sorry for the many emails you might get from this podcast. That is actually really good advice. Resonates deeply with me as well. Jason, thank you so much for being here.

Jason Lemkin (02:01:21):
Thank you for all the time, Lenny. I'm a super fan. It's great to be here and let me know anything I can do to support you or your community going forward.

Lenny (02:01:28):

# Building product at Stripe: craft, metrics, and customer obsession | Jeff Weinstein (Product lead)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Watching you operate on Twitter, you're just breaking this wall between the PM and the customer.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:04):
The moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem, that's a unbelievable gift. I will leave a meeting to just get one message back to them. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal that is infectious.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):
Many people told me I need to ask you about picking metrics.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:24):
Well, what was the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective? And okay, how do you know you have product market fit? Charts that showcase things are going up into the right on one hand and then tweets on the other.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):
You started at Stripe something called study groups.

Jeff Weinstein (00:00:39):
We show up four to eight people total pretend to be some company with some outcome problem. Rule one is you do not work at Stripe and rule two is we're not here to solve any problems. This is just about practicing empathy for the customer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Jeff Weinstein. Over the course of his six plus years at Stripe, Jeff was the product lead for Stripe's payment infrastructure teams. We helped scale Stripe payments to hundreds of billions of dollars in volume a year. He also led PMs and Teams on a number of zero to one bets at Stripe, and most recently took on the scaling of Stripe Atlas, which as of the day this podcast launches allows you to incorporate a new company in a single day, including handling 83B elections, incorporation documents, getting your EIN, share purchases, and all the things that used to take weeks or months before a company could begin operating. At this point, one in six new Delaware corporations are started on Stripe Atlas, which blows my mind. This episode ended up being the longest in my podcast history because I wanted to basically do an archeology of an incredibly effective and admired product leader.

(00:01:49):
We spent the entire conversation digging deep into the many skills that Jeff has built that enable him to consistently build successful and beloved products. We get into his go-go- go plus optimism, long-term compounding philosophy of building products, how to think about and operationalize product craft and quality. He shares a popular program that he started at Stripe called Stripe Study Groups that I think you should steal. We also talk about how to effectively talk to customers, how to know if you have product market fit for your new product, how to pick great metrics for your team, what he's learned about getting shit done at a big company. Also, advice that he's gotten from the founders of Stripe and so much more. This episode is for anyone who's looking to level up their product building chops in every way.

Jeff Weinstein (00:02:50):
Thank you Lenny of Lenny's Podcast. I knew what to expect, but it's fun to see the first name and the podcast all line up. I really appreciate you asking.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:59):
So I wanted to start with a quote that I found from you that I think gives a little perspective into how you think and how you approach the world. So here's the quote. "Very frequently I would do poorly on tests in school and then the professor would say very reasonably, 'Hey, I think you should bump down a level to the previous semester's pace,'" and you said, "I actually know that, that's why I'm in this class. I want to be in the class that I'm potentially the worst at." This isn't how most people think. This isn't how most people operate. Usually people want to get good grades, they want to be at the top of their class. Clearly you have a different approach and a different mindset. Where did this come from for you and how did this shape the way you think about product and the work that you do?

Jeff Weinstein (00:03:37):
Some of it was just the fact that I wasn't particularly good at the class and had to rationalize it for myself in some form. So in retrospect that sounds highfalutin, but at the time I just wasn't particularly good at the classes I was in. But I think it comes from growing up. I went to a pretty hippy-dippy K through 12 school in Baltimore, Maryland where we were really asked to think about why we were in school and to pick any of the courses that were of interest to us outside of AP programs or grades or any particular requirements. You really got to choose your own path. And I recall one particular class in high school, which was somewhat a science class, but it was called the History of Science, and we actually walked through and studied all of the, at the time, best understood ways the world worked in science, but then later were turned out to be wrong, right?

(00:04:40):
In the 1500s we believed X, Y, and Z. In the 1600s we believed A, B and C. just very confidently. In 1500s we thought something and then the 1600s we thought something very different. And so this class was quite impactful on me where we spent an entire year studying things that are not true. It was fascinating. That particular teacher employed another trick on us during that class, which was it took the tuition fee of our school and divided it by the number of hours and wrote the cost on a ticket and then handed us in the beginning of the year. Tickets for every single one of the classes and he would stand at the door and you would have to give him a ticket at the end of the class that he thought it was worth it. And just like that practice of deep intellectual understanding of how people evaluated something at the time and choosing for yourself to spend the time on it by just the physical act of handing that ticket to the teacher.

(00:05:44):
That really clicked for me. And so when I got to college and it was a real college university, people are coming from often quite more rigorous backgrounds of things that were true. I was a bit unprepared and I remember actually taking a microeconomics class that was quite advanced and had a close friend and we studied exactly the same information. We sat and looked at the same cheat sheets, we practiced the same quizzes, we read the same books, and he got the top grade in the class and I got the bottom and that's from where that quote came from where the professor said, I think you should bump, potentially bump down. I was like, "I already know that stuff. I'm interested in this topic. I'm going to try to improve, but look just because I'm significantly worse than the other kids in the class that has little to do with if I should leave." And he was particularly cool with it.

(00:09:07):
It's really interesting that you went to this liberal artsy hippy dippy school as you described, which a lot of people bash on. Why spend all this college money and time on a liberal artsy education and you ended up being really successful in a very technical, highly analytical data-driven company, and it's interesting that that experience still helped you succeed in this other path.

Jeff Weinstein (00:09:27):
It did take a change though because I started in... English was my selected major in school, but then I kept playing with computers and I kept liking math and I looked at the roles of the backgrounds of the people who were running the types of companies I loved. At the time Facebook was getting super phenomenally successful. Apple was already on their up and up again and everyone who was leading those places had technical backgrounds and I liked computers a lot, so I added computer science as an engineering degree midway through school. So I had to take the real science classes with the pre-med kids and the rest of it, and I did similarly poorly, but I did end up with a computer science degree and a liberal arts degree. So it was a journey, but I had to make a pretty big switch in the middle to get on that path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:16):
I asked you if there was one thing that you'd love to get across in this podcast. I asked you what would it be and here's what you said. Here's the first item on this list that you sent me, "Go, go, go ASAP plus optimistic comma, long-term compounding approach." Can you just talk about what you mean by that?

Jeff Weinstein (00:10:36):
Yeah, there's two things going on here. So I see the world as immediately we have just such opportunity to take action in front of us. We can be optimistic and go, go, go as soon as possible. I think that a lot of life is you get as much furniture as you've room in the house. We will do the work the night before it's due, so let's just make it due tomorrow. Can we turn tomorrow into today? So just optimistically seeing if we can just inject energy to go, go, go has produced surprising results and I think it ignites in other people that same interest and then it feeds off each other. And that's I think really in my bones from growing up. And then I added over time, had to learn this longer term, compounding, more strategic mindset where some of the things we want to accomplish, be it at my startups in the past or at Stripe, they can't be solved in an afternoon.

(00:11:41):
They're going to require layers of infrastructure and services and applications and UI and partnerships that really look like that iceberg drawing you see where you just see the top, but then there's the whole thing underneath and I've had to learn over time to pair my instinct of like, "Let's get it done today, let's move forward, let's see what we can get done. Let's make some mistakes, let's try it out." With, "Where are we going? What needs to be true over time? Where can we always invest? What will we never regret spending time in?" We'll never regret spending time making the latency of our payments APIs at Stripe faster. We'll never regret making it more reliable to send 83B election mails to the IRS. Like we'll never regret those things. So let's just always compound those capabilities over time. Then the trick is how do you mix this go, go, go attitude with a long-term compounding? That's something I still struggle with, but I try to purposely balance it more than I used to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):
It's such a good way of summarizing just how to be successful in a lot of things. Go, go, go ASAP, stay optimistic. Focus on long-term compounding growth. Is there an example of that in action? I know we're going to talk about Atlas a bunch, but I guess is there an example of that working for you or a product you worked on?

Jeff Weinstein (00:13:03):
I work at Stripe, which is a infrastructure company. We build things that help businesses do online commerce in various forms, and I've had a few roles at Stripe. I'm in our beautiful office here in South San Francisco, one of which was the product person that helped us decide how we were going to go global and how we were going to offer multiple ways for people to pay. It turns out there's more than just credit cards in the world. There's small hundreds of ways that people will naturally want to pay for things online and as a business you're going to, of course, just want to accept whatever it is people want to pay with. And for the first seven or eight years of Stripe, well prior to my being here, the incremental country ads and the incremental new payment methods was relatively flat over time and that was surprising to all of us who worked here because the world wanted it and we had a lot of people working on it and we were working very hard, but it wasn't producing returns in the way that we wanted.

(00:14:11):
And so actually the optimistic as soon as possible go-go attitude was not working. No matter how much energy we poured into building Thailand payment methods or UK bank transfers or an in-person payment system in Latin America, we just couldn't rack up points and get it done. So we had to step back and say, "Well, what is the world going to look like in 10 years? What was going to need to be true and how can we start to go there now?" Which meant going a lot slower, building internal platforms, sending people around the world to start to build these payment methods, uproot their lives, pay for their apartments, get them on airplanes, start using these payment methods actually in the world. And so it really our line flat line for a while and we're like, "Okay, is this strategy working? Is it not working?" But then over time we start to see it switch to nonlinear again and go from whatever it was, 10 payment methods at the time.

(00:15:03):
And now Stripe accepts over 100. So we got to 50 really quickly and then skyrocketed to 100. And I remember there being a meeting where we said, "Well, maybe we should just lock everyone in the basement and see if we can get from 10 to 50." That would be the intensity startup go attitude. But we looked at the individual components of what it meant to get this done and how long we wanted this to be true for and we had to go a lot slower. That was a very formative decision where you had to mix the go, go, go with the long-term compounding.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:39):
Awesome. Okay, so let's start to delve deeper into some of the specific seals that I hear you're incredible at and that I've seen you be incredible at on Twitter and LinkedIn and things like that. So the first is craft, craft and quality. I'm told by many people that you have a very strong obsession with craft and user experience and quality and even more so I'm told that you teach people at Stripe how to be obsessed with craft and quality and user experience in a very systematic way. I feel like this is something a lot of people are starting to realize is really important and or are trying to get better at, either personally or at their company. So first of all, let me just ask why is this so important to you? Why do you think craft and experience and quality is so important? Why do you put so much emphasis on it yourself?

Jeff Weinstein (00:16:25):
I think I'm really working backwards from failures in the past and avoiding them. And so maybe just a quick story. I started a company several years ago based on just a personal pet peeve of mine, which was I was a SQL analyst. Many you listening might have written SQL in the past, maybe the robots write the SQL for you now, but you still need to write SQL yourself. And every single time I wrote a SQL query, I wanted to run the same subsequent analysis. I wanted great version control, I wanted all the cool stuff that GitHub had for code but for writing data code. And so my friends and I built a little Python tool which basically let you run our style queries. It lets you draw charts and pivot tables quickly and sharing all this modern SaaS application stuff. But applied to SQL a few years ago and we turned that into a company.

(00:17:29):
We got some progress, but then there was this moment one day where we had maybe a couple 100 customers and we had an error where we basically by accidentally shut down the service and it was bricked for 10 or 20 minutes. And at the time we were hustling in our little dinky office to get the application back online. And we really were proud of ourselves about how reasonably quickly we did and people went back to using it. It wasn't a super long outage and we didn't lose any data. We were just high-fiving each other. And we went about our day and about a year later I realized that that was a...

(00:18:11):
I missed a huge moment that I should have pounced on, which is that during those 20 minutes, our customers weren't furious. They weren't emailing us like crazy, they weren't texting us, they weren't trying to find us on Google Maps and knock on our door and say, "Hey, I need this thing back online immediately." We heard a couple comments from them, it was little murmurs. And I didn't realize at the time that was the signal that we did not have product market fit. And I ended up wasting many more years on that project. And wasting is a big word. We built amazing software, people liked it, we were able to sell the company.

(00:18:55):
It helped many of us learn how to really build software. But I'm really trying to avoid that situation again. And I think craft is a dessert that you get after the meal of does your thing solve a real problem in the world and are people clamoring, needing it badly? And that's really my obsession is in finding problems in which people will pause their entire day to solve. They will leap through the computer to be like, "Oh my God, I have that problem. Do you have a solution?"

(00:19:32):
And if you focus on that style of product development and we can get into just how do you listen for that and then turn that into product. Later, you might get the opportunity to really provide craft and beauty and touches and moments and delight. But certainly there is no amount of craft, there is no amount of beauty, there's no amount delight or touches you can add to a thing that will solve the problem we had at our startup, which is that people didn't really need this. And that's the biggest error is picking something in which people don't really need it. And then going through these practices of trying to make it great when maybe it shouldn't exist in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):
I think a lot of people see all these tweets and messages about just obsessed with the craft of what you're building and you can easily lose sight of... Nobody even cares about what you're building. It could be the most incredible experience ever designed, but if it's not something anyone ever wants, it doesn't really matter.

Jeff Weinstein (00:20:34):
People don't really get out of bed for their second problem. They get out of bed for their first problem. And you have to carefully listen and not pitch your customer or your prospective customer as you're trying to figure this out. And I think this advice, not even advice just style applies to small companies, big companies, anyone which is people don't want to be pitched. I'm sometimes on a UXR call with a very well-meaning person or a founder who has a new product that they want advice on or they want to find customers. And the first thing that they start talking about when we get on the call is, "Hi, I'm the CEO of X, Y, and Z company. We do one, two, and three. I want to show you a demo." It's like, "Hold up, I'm a customer. I have..." What a wasted opportunity you've just done here.

(00:21:34):
I have so many problems, you're guessing ahead of time, what is my top problem and now that you've anchored and limited to the pitch you're going to miss, you very likely going to miss the burning problem that they have on the top of their mind. And it's not the customer's job to interrupt you and say, "Hey, could you stop your pitch? I want to tell you about my top problem." And you can see this down the stream, which then companies who launch things, put craft, have a great launch, raise money are then later gone. And it's because they built something that wasn't solving a burning need. And I think you can stem it all the way back to they were just pitching rather than sitting in silence and just waiting for their customer to just open their heart out about what's the most burning thing.

(00:22:28):
And sometimes I'll prompt our customers, I'll say, "Hey, do you mind just opening up your email? What's in there?" Or, "If you weren't talking to me right now, what would you be working on?" Or, "Hey, last week, what grinds your gears? What are you not looking forward to?" Or magic wand, "What do you wish you could just have off your plate immediately? Forget Stripe, forget about thing, work on just in your whole life. What is it that you do not want to be doing?" Or, "A massive opportunity you wish was just one door away?" And it's a little awkward because they don't know why you're asking that kind of question, but then you just sit there in silence. And for the most part, if you have amazing customers who are smart and ambitious and are trying to build their own business, they're going to want to offload their hardest thing to somebody else.

(00:23:17):
If you've earned trust along the way, and certainly not pitching is a great way of earning trust. You're just listening. We've learned a lot at Stripe from that. And that's where you can start to find adjacencies, right? "Well, hey, I don't know if Stripe could really help me with this, but wouldn't it be cool if we could identify if the person signing up on our site wasn't fraudulent or is who they say they are or isn't a bot, or are they really a dog on the internet?" And we're like, "We keep this as the major complaint from all of our customers, but we're not an identity company." It's like, "Well, I guess now we are because all of our customers who are trying to build their business all have this problem." And so via silence, you can just create your roadmap pretty quickly and drop a lot of the long UXR, long survey, long build cycle approach.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
So I love where we're going with this. This is where I was going to actually talk about next is just your ability to talk to customers and user research. It feels very unique, watching you operate on Twitter, you're just sharing your email constantly, getting on calls with people constantly. There's this, you're breaking this wall between... That a lot of people imagine there is between the PM and the lead of a team and the customer. You're not relying easy research. You're not waiting for someone else to do this work for you. Talk about just why and how you do this. I think there's so much to learn from just how you operate in finding opportunities, picking problems to solve by talking to customers.

Jeff Weinstein (00:24:53):
It's where the business comes from is customers. It is not a long shot hypothesis about why to talk to them. It's like if they love your stuff, they will tell their friends and pay fair prices for the product. We're so fortunate through the internet that people announced themselves as being interested in a topic. Sometimes they're interested in it by posting on Reddit a long thread or a screenshot of a customer service interaction that bugged them or hopeful that from their dorm room in country X, someone else in the world has solved the same problem. And the internet has given us all this absolutely magical forum that you can just yell out the window and then billions of people could actually listen to what you said out the window. Now, that's not all the time true for all people in all situations, but dramatically more true now than ever before in human history.

(00:26:05):
And so the fact that people wouldn't be listening to their customers and really jumping through the computer to talk to them surprises me. It's like I always sometimes think, "Do they have some other strategy? Are they so confident in what they're building that they don't need to hear directly from the people who will be using it?" And I think some of it is my own fear that I'm going to make the same mistake I've made in the past, which is build something that people like they're using but isn't solving a burning enough problem such that they're going to stop their day, they're going to tell their friends, we're going to be able to sustain the company economically over a long period of time. And that really just comes from hearing people's most burning problems and then just jumping through the computer and talking to them takes a little bit of nervous gumption, like walking up to a person at a bar or cocktail party and saying, "Hi, my name is Jeff."

(00:27:08):
It can be a little awkward, but then you get it. It's a rush once it starts to work. And once you get the iterative loop that they're excited to talk to you, they have problems, they see you as a trusted, not salesy, not pitching, not narrow-minded to just my product and my position, but I'm here to hear about all of your problems and see where we can help. Not promising we can help solve everything, but let's listen. That is infectious, both between the customers and internally. And so I'm able to bring more people into that practice. At Stripe, I'm able to quickly grab an engineer and hop on a call. I can forward a message over to a Slack group. And they know that because the customer's speaking directly, it somewhat trumps everything that's happening during the day. We could go to our meeting where we're going to guess what the customer wants or we could talk to them directly.

(00:28:08):
And you have to use a little bit of art to decide which customers you want to listen the closest to. But even at Stripe's scale, where we're dealing with many millions of businesses and many hundreds of millions of consumers on the other end of those businesses, you can pattern match relatively quickly. What are the styles of customers that represent where the world is going, the most ambitious, the most technical, the fastest growing, the most detailed. And you don't need 10,000 of those people to talk to. If you're text message friendly with five or 10 of those, you are going to have so much direct signal about where to go that you forget how you did it in the past.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:57):
I love these. So I'd love to learn more about these tactics that you've found helpful. So you've shared this idea of silence, talking to someone and just being silent, and I forget the phrase you used, but just like ideas emerge, like your whole road map can emerge from that silence. So let me share a few of the things you shared so far and I'm curious what else. Two is tweeting just like, "Hey, I'm looking to improve Atlas right now. What bugs do you have? Here's my email address." You talked about text messaging, just like, "Hey, can I get your number? And I'll just text you when I have questions." If there's anything else to add to these, that'd be awesome. And then what else have you found? Just ways to actually get to a customer and find opportunities that are important.

Jeff Weinstein (00:29:34):
Speed is an important one, which is just reducing the time between the moment the customer felt compelled enough to go out of their way to talk about some problem. They're busy, there are snacks to eat, they have families, they have other things to do. There's a lot going on in the world, a lot. Your dumb product, it's amazing that they would spend any of their time discussing it at all. I mean, most of the time if you don't like something, you just move along. You just apathetically, silently move forward in the world. And so the fact that someone took their finite time to succinctly with curiosity, communicate to the world or you about your product, that's a unbelievable gift.

(00:30:27):
That should be P-zero alert level intensity. And so I will leave a meeting, I will change what I'm doing to just get one message back to them. Even if it's, "Hey, I got this. I'm about to go to dinner. Can I hit you up tomorrow?" They're like, "Oh yeah, thank you. Awesome. I can't even believe you responded." That puts us in the camp of on the right trajectory where they're going to feel that they have a almost secret portal between this big brand of a company and another human who's just actually curious...

Jeff Weinstein (00:31:03):
... brand of a company and another human who's just actually curious what's going on, that's night and day. And it's also, fun fact, tip, when people are really hot on an issue and it could blow up on social or they're going to start becoming a detractor, we make mistakes, we have SLA breaches, we have errors, you're going to want to get on that stuff fast. And in those situations, my bar for how we will respond to those folks is not to just solve the problem, but it is to turn them into a promoter, and most of the time we're able to, even if there was a pretty relevant issue.

(00:31:40):
I remember one time at Atlas, we had this bug in which for a handful of our legal docs, they were handing out let's say, 25 shares rather than 25% of the shares. We dropped the percentage sign, and thankfully a founder noticed this in the docs and tweeted about it. My heart paused and I was like, "Oh no, this could be a really serious issue." And we were able to fix it and regenerate the documents relatively quickly for everyone that was impacted. And I was thinking to myself, "Wow, we really let this person down. We have one job to do, which is to get their company right and we didn't."

(00:32:20):
And that person was incredibly gracious about the situation and said, "Anytime you want me to just read your docs, I'd be happy to. I have a law degree. I care about this topic. I want to brainstorm with you about ways that Atlas could do more document creations." I was like, "Wow, I can't believe I was in this sort of defense position, and now we've gained a friend in the world who can be eyes and ears and brainstorm with us." And the team maintains a really close relationship with that person as they do with many, many founders who use Atlas.

(00:32:53):
And so, just again, we're so quick to put the outside world in this other camp where we need to touch it with kid gloves and treat it as a big blob and a cohort and a statistic, when it is a human with a problem who likes snacks, who is busy, and it's fun to do and it turns out to be an incredibly easy, fast way to figure out what to build.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:20):
There's a bunch of stuff I want to follow up here. One is, people may be hearing this and like, "Oh my God, I'd be overwhelmed with feedback and people to fix problems for and bugs and texting of people." They're just like, "There's so many people that potentially I'd have to be interacting with." How do you try to narrow that down? I know Atlas is a very highly adopted product. There's a ton of people, there's probably bugs, often people sending you feedback. How do you pick the people to zero in on?

Jeff Weinstein (00:33:47):
I think there are two parts to this. One, what a problem to have. Of all the problems in the world, "I'm overwhelmed by customer interest," is on the top list of problems I want to have. I think most entrepreneurs would purchase that problem as a state. And so, if you're in it, I think, take a deep breath and look at the sunrise or sunset and just enjoy the fact that you've built something that is meaningful enough that people would spend their time. Again, there are amazing snacks that they could be spending the time on otherwise, so that's a huge deal. And then two, you need the art. There's an art and science to picking where to go deep. I will happily respond to folks with, "I really appreciate that. Do you mind sending me a screenshot or a video?" And some of them don't. Okay, that's fine.

(00:34:45):
You kind of get a sense of quickly looking at how they wrote about it or just pattern matching how detailed they were, or how much they seem that they want to engage and kind of balance it that way. Otherwise, you can tell folks, "This is really awesome. Do you mind sending me an email with three to five bullet points about the details of how you got to this issue?" And that's not a 30-minute meeting. You don't need to blow up your whole life to get on the phone with them. It's not a huge homework assignment to them, but it's enough structure that it will self-select those who want to go deep, and then from there, you really do owe it to them to follow up if they're going to be that detailed. And at that point, you really have made a product friend for life and you'll kind of continuously go back to them. So you have to kind of tune it.

(00:35:48):
I also will bound some of these efforts, so I'll just completely make up one day a program. So, "Hi, Stripe's doing a bug-finder program." I made that up as I was driving to work one morning, tweeted it, was curious if anyone would send anything. "We'll be taking videos for the next three days to go super deep." And people are like, "Oh my goodness, I would love to be part of the Stripe bug-finder program. May I apply?" I'm like, "Oh, it's very selective. But yes, of course for you." It's just giving people permission through a program, even if it is deeply arbitrary, I find helps with bounding it, and then later I can follow up with the world, "Hey, we ran our first program, we got 65 videos," which we did. "We found dozens of issues," which we did. It was an incredibly valuable use of our time and it really came from just a single tweet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:53):
Something I saw you mention somewhere is that you only pay attention to feedback from people that are paying customers and ignore everything else. Can you talk about that?

Jeff Weinstein (00:37:00):
People who build things for people tend to be empathetic and interested and curious folks who have friends, and then those friends want to use your stuff because they know you and they like you and they'll have good feedback. But you need to figure out, is that actually your customer, or is that your friend trying it? Who is actually your target customer exactly? Not a company or a segment, not digital natives that are X big. I'm talking about Sarah in this department, who has these tabs open and just faced this problem and needs to solve it by 4:00 PM. That level of specificity. If that's your customer, and I'm talking mostly about B2B, which is where I spend a lot of my time as the social network, B2C stuff I have less intuition on, they're very willing to exchange money for solving their problems, incredibly so. Oftentimes, if you listen with enough silence, they might even say, "I'll pay you money to solve, blah." If you sit there long enough in silence.

(00:38:17):
And so, you could listen to your friendly friend who you got to play with your beta version and they'll say they liked it and they will click around. But that is extremely different from Sarah, who has the actual problem and is willing to pay. And it is so tempting to go down the first path with the friend group that I sort of needed a rule, which was like, "Okay, rather than..." I was like, "Well, don't pay attention to that quite as much. Really pay attention to, who is your target customer and are you in a fast iteration cycle for them and are they telling their friends?"

(00:38:51):
But that wasn't enough, because people are so drawn, myself included, drawn to the friendliness that I just set a rule, which is, "We discount all of that feedback from our friends to zero." That is not of interest to us. We don't even write it down. It's just not part of what we're talking about at all. We are only interested in Sarah, our target customer, and can we get her to solve whatever the problem is as quickly as possible, as jangly as possible and go from there?

(00:39:26):
And then the paying part is a forcing function because again, even with Sarah, because you're paying attention to her and solving her problem a bit, she'll say, "Of course, oh, this is great. I want feature X, Y and Z. Can it do one, two, and three?" Naturally, she would say that. But if you said, "And by the way, this thing is $10,000. We'll happily refund your money 100% the second you don't like it," she might say, "Whoa, whoa, wait a second. Yeah, I like this thing, but not $10, 000. For $10,000, it would need to solve X." And you're like, "Oh, there it is." That was actually what the thing that was of value, and we were all kind of dancing around this. It's useful, we're on the right track, and because I've fallen down that path myself so many times, I just set a rule.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:25):
This is great. I was actually going to ask. This technique of using silence, to help people actually practice it, you just shared this quote of, "For you to pay $10,000 it would've to do X." That's a really cool line to use. Is there any other advice there of just how to practice this idea of creating silence to help a potential customer share what they actually need?

Jeff Weinstein (00:40:45):
I encourage people to take an improv training class or two, just to get people out of their skin a bit. By the way, this advice applies to big companies also, not just small ones. And we have issues, and I hear other larger companies have issues where a big company will say, "Hey, we're an enterprise and we're going to pay you this big contract. All you need to do is build features one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and go through security steps, A, B, C, D, E, F, G." And this siren song of the big three-year contract of your first enterprise buyer, even when you're already big, you can go from Fortune 1000 to Fortune 500 to Fortune 10 to Fortune 1. There's always more. There are so many stories of the rug being pulled in the middle and they never actually use it and the contract never lands.

(00:41:38):
Same in partnerships. And so, I would say the same thing, which is, "If we're super serious about this, send us $1 million. Wire us $1 million. We'll happily wire it back anytime you need it, but let's actually put some stake in the ground about the value." And I find that in the cases in which they're like, "Whoa, wait a second, no, absolutely not. We can't commit here." That's really a good signal because you're about to spend a huge amount of time building something that might not ever be used, and that's the majority case I hear. Or you might get the opposite, which is, "Sounds great. Let's make sure our teams are trained on it faster. How can we get you to our office to explain it? We need it to really work with this system we haven't talked about yet. And now that we're paying, we want it even faster."

(00:42:32):
And so, I find that it puts a fork in the road towards faster success or avoiding the non-success case. And even at Stripe scale, I've heard our founders somewhat push this methodology on us, where one from the outside might think, "Well, it's a 8,000 person company. Surely they have just regular ways of building things for larger customers, and we too need these style of commitments if we're going to go off roadmap."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):
So a big lesson you're sharing here is essentially, make sure people are ready to pay for something that they're asking for. That is the ultimate sign that they-

Jeff Weinstein (00:43:13):
And by the way, ready to pay is different than paying. Significantly different, significantly different. I've also thought of, "Well, as long as they're ready to pay and they said they would pay and they look at the contract, we should feel good." That is not the same as paying. Paying is an independent group of people saying, "My problem is burning enough that I'm willing to exchange something I have that has value for the promise of what you're going to do." And now it's a real commitment. That is extremely different than ready to. So I will often be on the phone or video, whatever with a founder and I will have them practice charging me. I'll just say, "Hey, I'm just a friend. I'm trying to help you out. It's a little bit self-serving because I work at Stripe and I want to get feedback on our products."

(00:44:09):
I'll say, "Feel free to sign up for any invoicing or payment service. I don't really care which one. You're welcome to choose Stripe if it's easy enough for you, I'd love to hear your two cents, and send me an invoice or a payment link for $1 right now, right now. That way, when it comes time to actually charge your first customer, it won't be your first time. It won't feel weird. You'll have already done this, you already have a dollar in your account, you already have your logo on the top right of the invoice. It'll feel great." And I probably could go through my email inbox and just see $1 receipts to random people because I'm just so convinced that the difference between paying and willing, ready, I thought they would pay is night and day different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):
Yeah, there's this term, willingness to pay that I feel like it should change, as you're saying, to just cross that willingness to even just-

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:05):
Paying.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):
Paying, exactly.

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:07):
Yeah. And we can refund the money. There's no issue at all. Just other tricks on how to get people going is, ask them about their regular life as a human, "What did you do yesterday?" And they'll be like, "Oh, at work?" I'm like, "Or not. Whatever." And people, they'll start to spill, they'll just start to spill and eventually they'll get to their biggest problem pretty quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:33):
Let's talk about metrics, going in a different direction. Many people told me I need to ask you about picking metrics and the importance of metrics and how you think about metrics. So let me just maybe start with a question of, just why do you think picking the right metric and why are metrics so important in building successful products?

Jeff Weinstein (00:45:52):
I somewhat walk around with the belief that the product manager's responsibility is to produce product market fit. And okay, how do you know you have product market fit? Charts that showcase things are going up into the right on one hand, and then tweets on the other. So metrics like quantitative and qualitative, and I really see them as deep siblings and equals, you really need both. It's not oh, OKRs versus something. There are some things you want the texture of the person on video showing how complicated a thing was. And then also, we're trying to make an economically viable system that we can run at large scale and you can't keep all that stuff in your head and need to measure it. And so, I think metrics at their best are a numerical representation of the value we're providing for the customer.

(00:46:59):
One could measure anything. You can just start counting events and log lines. We've made it incredibly cheap to count stuff. And so, now we have this big privilege of choosing what to measure. And I really just try to map it all the way back to, "Well, what was actually the value that we're trying to produce for the customer and can we measure it from their perspective?" Whereas I think it's natural, both because when you work inside of a company, you're just thinking internally, but also the way that the metrics are collected inside your application to be more internal-oriented. How many people logged in? Okay, that's a fine measure, but how many people accomplished what they were trying to do after they logged in, is not just necessarily sitting there as a single event in your database. You have to think about it a bit. Another reason why I spend a lot of time crafting a small number of these metrics is, they force trade-offs and decisions.

(00:47:56):
So we could all sit around all day and say, "Hey, I heard all these customer problems, we should build X, Y, and Z." And another person could absolutely reasonably say, "Well, I heard from these customers, we should build one, two and three." And they're all true. We could have a lot of success in both, but the majority case is that we don't build either and we sit around and argue and bicker and we go slowly. "What are we going to do to naturally, organically every day, orient a larger group of people in the right direction and see if our tactics are generating progress over time for a customer from their perspective?" And metrics on the left and a series of tweets on the right is a pretty great combo.

(00:48:42):
Here's an example. A couple years ago I had been working in our payments group at Stripe for a bit, and then I started working on some of our banking and incorporation services. In Atlas, when I started working on it, it had had some success. It had already existed for four or five years prior to me spending time on it. But when I started to look at the support tickets, people were pretty unhappy frequently. They had a DocuSign stuck in their email box. They needed a co-founder's address, but they didn't know their co-founder's address. They couldn't log into the dashboard to figure out their 83(b) manual filing instructions. And we saw this basically in the first week of spending time on Atlas. I was just like, "Just show me all the support tickets. Are they happy support tickets? People writing in being like, 'Oh, I love this service, it's absolutely fantastic. Can you just do A, B, C more for me?' Or are they sad support tickets?" And they're like, "Oh my God, they're all sad support tickets."

(00:49:45):
And so, we're just asking ourselves, "Well, why would someone recommend Atlas to a friend?" I was like, "Well, it would have to accomplish A, B and C activities for them. It would have to get their company, it would have to handle getting their tax ID from the IRS. It'd have to handle all the downstream administrivia." But surely, if they had a bunch of support tickets at the end, they're not going to go tell their friends to use this thing. We could measure all of the intermediate parts, we could measure the success rate and the frequency of incorporation services and we do all those things, but if you looked at the support tickets, there's just no way if you had a support ticket, you would recommend it to a friend. And so, we suggested this metric to ourselves, companies that have no support tickets through the incorporation service.

(00:50:36):
The whole process, from the moment you start the application open, actually the first page load at the very beginning, all the way through the process waiting for the government, waiting for the IRS, and we give you two more weeks to write into support. We give an extra buffer two weeks. And if you get through that whole thing with no support tickets, that's a yes. If you have any number of support tickets, that's a no. And we just looked at the percentage of founders that were going through the service with zero support tickets, which is very different than looking at an average, right? You could have the average as 0.3, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're getting to 0.2 is going to cause them to tell their friends more. And we looked, and only 15% of founders were getting through Atlas with zero support tickets through that metric.

(00:51:31):
And I just thought, "Okay, well let's just drive that number way up, and let's look at the support tickets aside what people are needing and we'll bake it into the product, and presumably it'll fix it. People will like that more and then tell their friends." And over about 18 months, we took that number from 15% to 85. We basically just flipped it. And you can look at the market share plotted on the same timeframe and it's the same shape. And I think you have to find a measure by which it speaks directly to what the customer wanted, and that if you accidentally leaked your dashboard to them, your customer would be ecstatic to learn that that's what you were measuring the whole time. If we were to showcase the internal Atlas metrics, which we often just screenshot and publish, I think they'd be pretty happy to hear that we were spending all of our time making sure that none of them had support tickets.

(00:52:33):
And it was incredibly encouraging and motivating to the engineers on the team because we could just assign them a topic. "Hey, look at all these support tickets. Why don't you come up with the product spec, the scope, the solution? Oh, want to learn more? Just reply to the support ticket email, figure out what they need." And so, we kind of turned all of the engineers on the team into PMs to go and one issue at a time, figure out what needed to change and build products for it. And that's where we pushed forward on 83(b) elections, automating it, sending in the mail for folks. We built our own signing service.

(00:53:17):
We turned everything into a click. We did just did sort of the obvious things we saw in the tickets, but as the PM, I was able to just sort of, not on autopilot, but really sit back and have content full conversations with engineers who were bringing solutions and ideas for product, rather than one person going through all of the potential ideas, scoping them and assigning them. And because it was based in what people were saying and wanted, it was very motivating for everyone on the team. So somewhat long answer, but figuring out something in which every day we can wake up and look at the same metric and with some confidence know what to do, is so much better than, "Let's figure out what to do each month, and starting from scratch."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
I think this is amazing and important advice, just the power of a single metric that everyone on the team can understand, rally around and use to prioritize the work they're doing. I've seen exactly the same sort of impact. Funny enough, Airbnb, one of the teams actually had a metric sort of like this, basically reducing the people contacting Airbnb with support issues. But what ended up happening is, their team started just making it harder to contact support because they're like, "Maybe they don't need to contact support about all these trivial issues, so maybe let's encourage them to figure it out themselves." Is there anything you've learned about to try to avoid these kind of second order effects that are of perverse incentives of a metric?

Jeff Weinstein (00:54:47):
We look at multiple metrics, but we will optimize around one and you have to use your own judgment to look at some of these countermeasures and pick them. We would also, that would sort of be our overarching metric for a year, but then we would pick specific tactical metrics about how we would accomplish it. So just an example that both is how we solved a problem, but also it's just a style of metric that was useful to us. Of course, some of these support tickets included things like, "I'm waiting to hear back from Atlas about, if they're going to approve my application because Stripe is required for very good reasons to evaluate certain business types, or sanctions, lists and the worldwide products." So there is some, should be incredibly quick, but there is a bit of a review process, and of course if you were not hearing back from us, you would be upset because you're trying to make your company immediately, "This is ridiculous. Let's get back to us quickly."

(00:55:59):
And so, we knew that one of the reasons that people were writing to support was like, "Hey, what's up with my review? What's going on?" And we knew that our tactic was just to drive up how quickly we got to a final decision on folks and to reduce the number of overturned rejections, where someone writes back in saying, "Hi, come on, I'm totally just making something reasonable. What's up? Why did you reject me?" And so, we would pick these overarching single metric, which was the companies with zero support tickets, but then we would have a specific KR that was owned by an engineer, which is the tactic that we're going to do. And so, we would not allow ourselves the perverse tactics to sort of just casually exist. We would choose which tactics we're going to do and then set a metric for it.

(00:56:49):
And the other reason I love this metric is, it's a cohort metric by which you're trying to drive something up into the left. Sometimes people will get excited about a chart that goes up into the right, it's kind of a meme, "Oh, that's going up to the right." I'm really excited about charts that go up into the left. So you have to figure out some optimization that you're trying to maximize. And so, in this particular case of this risk review, we would look at, "Hey, for the cohort of customers that started last month, how quickly did we get them to their final risk review by number of days since they submitted?" And so, you want a chart that looks a lot like, "Here we go, right up to the top." Because you want 100% of your customers to get their final decision as quickly as possible.

(00:57:44):
Wouldn't you know it, when we looked at the chart, it was doing this. And so, each month we would just make it a little better, a little better, a little up and to the left, up and to the left, up and to the left. And now basically 100-ish percent of people get their risk review within an hour, from a long tail taking a long time. And so, we would constrain the tactic through a metric and then watch it through an optimization function. And then when we got to a point where we were happy with the target, we could put down the tactic. That's another really useful thing about metrics, you can decide when to stop a tactic because you get to some level of success that you're comfortable with and you can always choose to pick it back up later.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:23):
So there's some really cool lessons here of just how to pick a good metric. Just to kind of maybe summarize what I'm hearing is, you kind of worked backwards from essentially NPS, like, "Why aren't people recommending Atlas?" You found, "Okay, well people that are complaining and having issues with support and running into problems, most likely are going to be detractors, not going to want to recommend Atlas, so let's have those really ambitious goals. Eventually nobody has a support ticket/let's just track how many people have zero issues." And then you identify, "Okay, what's driving a lot of these support tickets? It looks like this risk timeline till they get to this certain milestone, let's make that our goal for the next quarter or whatever, and let's focus there and then make an impact." And then I imagine move on to other levers within this bucket of zero context.

Jeff Weinstein (00:59:08):
You have to pick the right metric for your audience in... I wouldn't wouldn't fully export that metric to everyone. That was not a terrible one to export, but in the founders choosing where to get started mindset, again, this isn't just deeply spending time listening to your customers. They all ask their friends, "Hey, how did you start your company?" They want to talk to an older sibling of sorts about how it went. And so, we decided that our go-to-market strategy would be to delight our current customers such that they would tell their friends. And other businesses, that's always somewhat useful, but you can also reach people with billboards and Google ads and other types of upsells. That's very difficult in the moment that someone is starting a company that's sort of a National Geographic, can you get the picture of the bird at exactly the right time?

(01:00:10):
How are you even supposed to go find people who are about to start companies? Thankfully, they have this practice of just asking their friends. And so, if their friends loved it, they're going to just recommend it. And that has the metric and the tactic and the go-to-market all lined up, rather than sometimes in cases you might hear someone say, "Well, let's make the product quality better." Well, we all make the product quality better, but why? Why is this actually going to move what our customers want, and the business board? And when you can line them all up, it can be quite beautiful, especially when you can see it month-over-month for a long period of time. One other metric I think that I would export to anybody, is if you are unsure what to measure, we have this, I don't know if we stole it from somebody else or if we came up with internally, whatever, is just users having a bad day, where we will just emit a log line anytime we think that a user bumped into a problem.

(01:01:14):
So maybe they hit a 404, or maybe their payout was one day after the ETA, or they had more than 10 payment declines, you can kind of brainstorm again or just listen to customers, what would cause you to personally have a bad day, and then just emit an event when that occurs. And then you could just make a stacked bar chart of all the bad day reasons and the frequency by which they're happening, and it's eye-opening to see those frequencies. And it's kind of a metric I hadn't thought about until Stripe's scale, in which you just don't know what's happening until you emit the log line and count it. The frequencies could be...

Jeff Weinstein (01:02:03):
... emit the log line and count it. The frequencies could be kind of mind-blowing. And I think for almost any scale business, if you are bored one day and you're not sure what to measure, just make a user having a bad day chart, emit a log line and count it as a bar chart and then anybody else can add their own bar chart on top of it. And so, it's become a way for teams to scale their understanding of users through metrics by just saying, "Hey, look, anytime anybody has an idea about why a customer is having a bad day, just emit a log line, put it on this chart, and then we can choose over time which bad day reasons we want to burn down and hopefully just eradicate them, not just minimize them.

(01:02:41):
But it gave us kind of a background noise counting system for where there are problems and anytime there's an incident or some customer issue, the first thing I think is, "Ooh, I wonder if we have a bad day reason for this." And if we do, I actually feel okay. I'm like, "Oh yeah, it is a bad day for this customer." I wish I didn't have it, but at least we're aware and we can evaluate it against other bad days that we want to burn down. What does sometimes a little bit grind my gears or gives us an opportunity is like when we didn't know about that bad day. And it's a surprise to us too, that is for me is immediate action. It's like, okay, cool. We have to figure out a way to count this bad day. We got to get it on the chart. That way we can make an informed decision about when to invest improving it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:35):
And I love this idea. I haven't heard this before. So the idea is just make a list of what happens to a potential customer that would cause them to have a bad day. What are some examples for Striper Atlas that you guys have?

Jeff Weinstein (01:03:45):
Are you a Stripe customer, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:47):
I am with my newsletters. The payments go through Stripe. I check my dashboard every day.

Jeff Weinstein (01:03:52):
Cool. So what would be a bad day for you?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:53):
Oh, I see some silence happening here. It not loading. The numbers taking a long time to show up. Something being completely off in there, not being able to log in. The silence is good. I just want to keep going.

Jeff Weinstein (01:04:19):
The question is how much to the audience is how much of the silence will we edit out before it goes live? But this is what I'm talking about, right, is I could guess them, right? And as you were saying those, I know the URL of those charts. I know the login one because I feel that too. So I play with Stripe all the time and then you get a two FA too frequently and come on, I had the same cookie. I was just here yesterday. So we count all that stuff and try to make it better over time. But I'm so excited when someone brings me a new bad day I hadn't thought about yet because that's like product cabinet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:00):
I love it. And your advice here is this doesn't necessarily have to be your goal or metric. It's just watching this thing that could lead to a lot of interesting ways of operating.

Jeff Weinstein (01:05:10):
A couple other just like quick metrics things because it's a bit of a... I don't know, some people like cycling or something. I guess, I like metrics. People get a really nice bike. I want a really great metric. Picking metric titles that make you feel something. So we could have called that measure of companies, number of companies that do not send a support ticket over X period and Y period with min... You sometimes see these charts where the metric itself named itself. This is just companies with zero support, that's it. And the brevity and the focus and the customer mindset built into the chart name can become currency inside the company. It's like, oh, I'm working on making this chart go up and it feels good to just say the name out loud rather than some complicated underscores and mins and maxes and the database field name is still in the chart title.

(01:06:26):
These are aesthetic choices, but I think make dramatic differences in the cultural willingness for people to buy in and get excited about it and reduce the need of a product person to just remind everyone every day why they're doing it. It's like the metric is motivating us because it's a motivating thing to talk about. And then lastly on metrics is there's just good hygiene that people should bring to their measures. Percentages shouldn't have 41 significant digits if only two of the digits are relevant. You should keep all the measures of your dashboard on the same X-axis. These are just stylistic things that increase the frequency that people want to just wake up every day and open the dashboard and look at it. And that is so powerful if your whole team is looking at the same set of information that has the heartbeat of the customer every single day.

(01:07:26):
In fact, we can measure at Stripe the usage of our dashboards by team, and so we can see which teams are themselves looking at their own metrics and that is an incredibly useful predictor of how on the same page they are and how customer obsessed they are. So I just think it's not an area that's sort of behind the scenes, bean counting reliability is the machine hot. You can make metrics that mean something to the customer and you would be proud if they were to be screenshot and put on the internet and be like, "Wow, I feel like that company is taking their promise to me seriously. And I can see myself on those metrics as a customer." That's where we're really shooting for.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
So [inaudible 01:08:19] back what you just said there, which I think is a subtle point potentially, is just making the dashboard look nice, like the hygiene of the naming conventions and the decimal points and the chart. In your experience, you find that really powerful and important.

Jeff Weinstein (01:08:34):
A couple of years ago, Stripe did internal work to make an internal metrics kind of dashboard system. And we have a special place called Go Metrics. Many people use a go/service where you can just quickly go to a URL. And again, I have to sometimes do a rule rather than a policy. My rule is if it's not on Go Metrics, I'm not going to look at it. So if people can send me one-off queries or charts or screenshots or presentations or emails of charts and data, but that is in the wind, we can't interrogate the query metrics are almost always wrong. For many weeks, we didn't quite get the definition correctly. You have to live in the metric for quite a while before you really believe in it. And so, if you're always looking at some one-off version, it's just very difficult for it to rise up to the level of importance that is a thing we should trust to help us decide what to do. That's an incredibly high bar. And so, I just find you have to look at it frequently enough.

(01:09:46):
And if you're going to look at it frequently enough, it means it needs to be in a discoverable place. You almost go through a couple stages of grief about it because we'll kind of put a metric up in a place and everyone initially is like, "Wow, this is great. I was so excited to finally see this." And then a couple of days later, "I don't quite understand it. What does it actually mean? I saw this other metric from this other angle that kind of makes it feel counterintuitive that it's like this." And then you kind of look into it, "Wait a second, we've been counting it wrong the whole time. Oh, no." And then you look at it the third week and it's a completely different version and then you hope that we forget about it and maybe we'll go onto something else and nope, we're not going to forget about it. Week four comes around, you're like, "Wait a second. Okay, this is..." Then the team meeting starts, "Hey, just a reminder, let's just bring up the metric again, not a screenshot of it. Go to the URL."

(01:10:39):
And just that level of frequency and specificity and ritual around it is what brings it into the decision-making culture. And again, we treat it the exact same as we do tweets. It's the quantitative and qualitative right next to each other. And because you're putting that amount of attention to it, you can't have a 1,000 metrics. We just don't physically have time the day to bring that level of care and understanding to so many things. So then it forces you to know so many things you could care about down to a small number of things that you really must care about. And again, that practice goes back to do you really understand what your customer wants? And so, for all these tactics, it's about finding out what your customer wants and then different versions of how do we sort of know it's true over time and our tactics improving?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:32):
It sounds so simple when you describe it that way. This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations. Or you can use an all-in-one document SDK. Most product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features.

(01:12:24):
For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's Dragon Drop Builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/lenny. Kind along these same lines, there's something that I've learned you started at Stripe to help people obsess with user experience and get quality to where it needs to be and move a lot of these metrics, something called Study Groups. Talk about what that is. I'm very curious.

Jeff Weinstein (01:13:19):
Okay, let's imagine we understand our customer, we've understand their burning problem. We've built a solution that's in their hands, they're using, it's hopefully better than their alternatives and they're starting to use it and we have some real traction. You could still measure the success, you could still look at the tweets and then, of course, you go to pick it up yourself and you're like, "Wait a second, this thing is horrible. How did it get so bad?" Anyone who's built a product that has gone over the horizon of it's actually in production and being used for a year or more as you go to iterate on it, especially when you're in a larger company and there's multiple teams and multiple products going on, there's just some entropy in the world that causes these things to go bad. I actually have a hard time naturally explaining it.

(01:14:13):
You kind of think to yourself, well, it's code. It just must be running the same every day. But somehow you do enough things in a row. And what was once a smooth end-to-end flow for accomplishing a test or a customer is all of a sudden some Byzantine complicated broken mall where all the doors are busted and you have to know exactly the way to get through the dashboard to solve your problem. "Wait a second, I thought this was great just a second ago." And many of us have experienced that. Now, okay, what are we going to do about it? Well, one is it is really difficult to take time during the day to allow yourself to even know that this is true. Because if you're working on one particular team, you're going to have some next thing you're shipping, you're going to have your customers, you're going to be doing great product work.

(01:15:14):
Meanwhile, your current thing kind of starts to rot in the world and decrease all the trust you've earned to build what you're building now. It is actually difficult to decide, well, what hours during the week am I going to block off from my future progress to see it from the customer's perspective today? And there are various techniques to try to incentivize or to structure a group of people to do that. Stripe has a thing called friction logs as well, which is a single individual will pretend to be a customer and go through a product experience end-to-end and write it down. And that has been quite successful at Stripe for very motivated people who can block off the time and have the wide enough context to do a complicated thing end-to-end and have the time to write it up and the position the company to send it out as a critique potentially to not just your own team but in a whole organization.

(01:16:31):
So that's actually a pretty high bar to crossover. So I was kind of brainstorming what could we do to make this more fun and have the frequency which we're looking at our own products dramatically increase? And we kind of iterated few through ideas. And I landed on this thing called Study Group, which is basically a random group of people inside the company. They might not work on any particular team. They might not all be PMs, just like literally anyone who wants to sign up, a support person, a sales person, someone who's on our events team, an engineer and our infrastructure stack. Anybody can sign up for a Study Group. We show up maybe four to eight people total. We pretend to be some company with some outcome problem. Maybe we want to accept money in person at an upcoming farmer's market, or we want to run a multi-country global business where we have software that another business would use to run their business. If it was something quite complicated.

(01:17:38):
We could pick any motivating goal. And there are two rules to Study Group rule one is you do no longer work at Stripe. You do not work at Stripe, not pretend, don't work at Stripe, not try to forget you do not work at Stripe, you've never worked at Stripe. You work at... And we make up a name of the company, Dolphin Aquarium Industries, and we will pick a CEO of the company from the group amongst us. And okay, Jenny is the CEO. "Hey, Jenny, what do you want to do today?" "Well, I want to sell in-person tickets to the Dolphin Aquarium." It's like, "Cool, where would just start?" So we actually embody the customer. We will not break character, it's a little bit of the improv thing and as the kind of maestro of Study Group, I will firmly but kindly, if I hear you use any internal Stripe knowledge, which is natural to do, because, well, you worked on a team and you know where that button really is.

(01:18:41):
And the docs link goes a little bit to the wrong place, but if you click the other link, you'll get to it. If I can see you use any internal Stripe knowledge, I'll just pause and say, "Hey, let's redo the sentence or redo what we did with no Stripe knowledge. As a reminder, you don't work at Stripe." And it takes us a couple of times, but people really get into it and all of a sudden we'll start making up characters and the CEO will be like, "Oh, Tim, you're our designer. Where are we going to get the color palette?" All of a sudden there's a person who's not a designer in real life is now all of a sudden having to practice the empathy to be in a customer's position. And because we're going to be doing it for an hour, hour and a half at a time, you actually start to believe that you don't work at Stripe and you work at Dolphin Aquarium Industries and you start to really feel it.

(01:19:34):
So that's rule one. You don't work at Stripe. And rule two is we're not here to solve any problems. We're not here to critique, we're not here to solution or suggest, we're not here to file bugs. All of those things is recorded. We can do that later, whatever. This is just about practicing empathy for the customer and going through the product. And we have done more than 25 of these at Stripe thus far in just this year, last few months of 2024, more than 250 people have participated in the Study Group. And it is deeply eyeopening for those involved. The responses are sort of business emotional, not super emotional, but just, "Wow, I can't believe how hard it was to accomplish X, Y and Z. I thought we were amazing at blah." It's like, "Well, we actually are still pretty good, but we need to get back towards amazing" or Wow, "I didn't even know that internally people wouldn't know that our products did 1, 2, and 3."

(01:20:45):
And this has become so internally popular that teams have adopted for themselves. And so, we've kind of franchised Study Group internally already where different teams will run it. But I think we're going to continue it because I think a little bit is coming out of the pandemic. People just want more group activities. I think some of it is the slowness by which we do it. We're not rushing through it. Which another reason I appreciate your podcast as well is let's really get into the details and not be rushed for time. You forget that you have a meeting at the end kind of amount of time. No one is to blame or defensive because it's not your product at all. It's a random group of people. We don't even introduce ourselves about what team we worked on. We're just all here as participants to embody the customer. And then I think lastly, a reason why it's worked, and these are many of these just been actually super surprising to me.

(01:21:39):
I wouldn't have been able to prick ahead of time, is it's just fun. People want to make up the name of the company. They're excited about what Dolphin Industries would sell. A person who's not a CTO in real life gets to pretend to be a CTO and there's little theatrics to it, but it has been different enough from our other approaches for a company like Stripe, which is already pretty focused on this topic, that we think that there's enough legs here that we're going to keep it and kind invest in groups pretending to be the customer and going through it painstakingly slowly rather than only demos or only writing, which has other benefits, but misses the participation of a larger group and more fresh eyes. So it's been fun and we named it Study Group. I guess, I named it Study Group because I wasn't sure it would be initially. So I just came up with something that sounded cutesy, but gave me enough leeway that we could kind of adjust it over time. And this is where we've landed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):
It's fascinating that there's so much theatrics and ceremony necessary for a product team and a company to find out these things about their product. You would think people are like, "Oh, we know how onboarding looks. We know all these things," but basically what you're saying is you don't, and you need to do these sorts of things in order to really know what your product is like these days.

Jeff Weinstein (01:23:20):
The customer does not live in our walls. They aren't. They're not here. They don't know our lingo. And it is just so natural for our internal mindset and lingo to flow into the application over time. And you need some counterbalance to get there. And I think it has to be an unnatural counterbalance. It used to frustrate me actually more like, "Wow, why aren't we doing this?" Well, we're actually doing great work to move something forward and we have our local optimizations. It'd be difficult to get to this level of specialization that multi-product companies are trying to do without that level of focus on a per team basis, but then you need something unnatural to help us bring it back.

(01:24:12):
And so, I'm constantly looking for non-punitive fun ways objectively to get more perspectives from the outside in. If it's breaking the fourth wall to get on the phone on Twitter, if it's looking at a metric of users having a bad day, which is just like counting what's happening, you can't argue with that. Or a random group of people just kind of scratching their head trying to find a button, those are truths in the world that we're trying to make sure are inputs to all of our teams. And if you don't have those inputs, I can totally naturally see where the entropy of the world leads you to have Frankenstein bad products, even when all the individual parts are well oiled and run by great people. So you need something unnatural.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):
There's an interesting trend and thread through our talk so far broadly, there's just an obsession with making something great and awesome. And then a layer below is just an obsession with the user experience being as great as possible. And for a lot of PMs, there's not a direct line between make the experience as amazing as possible to growth and revenue and success and things like that. And it feels like for you and for Stripe broadly, there's this innate implication. If we're making the experience better and better and better, we will grow. You're nodding your head a little sideways a little bit, so I'd love to hear just your thoughts on just this obsession with experience and user issues. But we also have to go to the business. What are the metrics are moving?

Jeff Weinstein (01:25:51):
If someone else has a strategy for moving revenue that isn't getting it from customers, I want to know about it because it's so hard to get it from customers. If there's some faster path, please tweet me and tell me about it because this is very hard, a lot of work to do. So if there's something else, I want it on the table, but I often find it's part of the product experience. So maybe it's internal sales tools. We can do a Study Group about our internal sales tools process and our deal desk and our margin structure. We can do a friction log on our third party vendor process or a migration service or the way an ecosystem partner helps deploy our services into a big enterprise. Nothing is sort of off limits from product. In fact, I was chatting with a friend who runs the company and they were small company on the verge of product market fit starting to feel, customers starting to pull and they're like, "Oh, but our self-service funnel, it's so leaky and we have all this support coming through self-service."

(01:27:03):
First of all, congratulations, unbelievable that they're going through your product, even attempting self-service and contacting you. The majority case would be no one tries or they try and fail and don't contact you. So again, what a problem to have. And two, they wanted to minimize the support. In that particular case, it's like, "Well, what's actually in those support tickets? What's in those sales? Those are really sales contacts." They're like, "Oh, they want to learn more about how they get started." They want to know the expertise about... This is a particular company, it's a healthcare related company. They wanted to know the healthcare choices available. They wanted to know how to migrate from some old system they had to it.

(01:27:41):
I was like, "That's the product. The thing you're talking about is the product." Turn those moments during your self-serve process into not self-serve and make the product experience be let's get you on the phone. And now when they get on the phone, they know the first name of the person they're talking to because they have it from the onboarding forum and all of a sudden it feels like you are still in the product, but it's not software. Now it's a person, but it's a person backed by internal software, which knows as much as they can about the customer and what they want. And I was really inspired by Fidelity, which is a big financial institution where many people listening might have switched jobs and had to move their 401(k) or something like this from job A to job B. Maybe in some universe it'll be three clicks, but not today or certainly not when I tried a couple of years ago. You got a call and go on a phone tree and all the shenanigans, and then I got on the line with someone from Fidelity. They're like, "Hi, Jeff. They knew about the old company. They confirmed my address." They said, "By the way, this is not a digital process yet. We're going to FedEx you an envelope and inside it is going to be the thing for you to sign. Here's going to be exactly where to sign. Here's a picture we're going to sign. We've put another envelope inside that envelope ready to go. And so, you just take the papers from envelope one, sign them where it says and put them in envelope two and put it back to the [inaudible 01:29:16]."

(01:29:15):
It's like, "Wow, that is product." That is a product experience where I think some people would say, "Oh look, the product experience has to only be in software." So I feel when people think, oh, product quality and craft has some limit towards business value, there's some asymptote that you have to be like, well, kind of product plate time quality is over. We need to talk about business. It's like, let's figure out exactly what is causing the business to happen and make a product, even if it doesn't look naturally the same as our SaaS, software, browser, mobile, whatever versions. I think we can see the entire experience as it. And from there, I include the sales process, I include the support process, I include tools that help with compliance and everything else. And again, if people have a way to make all those things bad and lead to great increasing revenue over time in sustainable ways, I want to know about that because that sounds so much easier than the version that we're trying.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:23):
I love that and clearly it's worked for Stripe. Just one last question. I want to talk about Atlas and dive into just like what is Atlas and how is it doing and things like that. I know there's some new stuff coming that you're going to share, but one last question about Study Groups. How do you decide what product you're going to pick to do a Study Group on? And then what is the expectation with the result? I imagine there's a PM sitting around like, "Oh my God, I just got this 10 page report on all the problems."

Jeff Weinstein (01:30:48):
So initially, I just made up a list of stuff that I thought would be fun to Study Group to kind of kick it off. And now, because it has a bit of an internal brand and it's exciting, and people who have gone to a Study Group say nice things about Study Group there, they actually proactively say, "Hey, we should Study Group blah," or "We're launching something next week. We should Study Group it before it goes out the door." Or now I actually just have a huge backlog of things to Study Group based on what people want. And now we're again franchising it. So we're going to have Study Group captains and people run their own Study Groups, and so we can really scale this behavior. But we did our first Study Group of an internal tool recently. And so, that I think is going to catch on just anything at all can be Study Group. It just takes about an hour and a couple of people and you open up the Zoom and that's it.

(01:31:37):
And then for expectation wise, look, it is so tempting to put more regulation on something. Okay, well, everything coming out of this program needs to be scored and rubricked and have SLAs. That is extremely reasonable. As some of these next steps, we do notice things that are of serious issues and we have some formal processes inside of Stripe for elevating bugs to certain priority levels that get tagged and have SLAs for teams to acknowledge and review. And so we kind of funnel the outputs of a Study Group into our already existing formal processes rather than having some new special thing that's going to bother a particular team. I will say though that it is difficult to watch one of these Study Groups and if you are the team involved in some piece of it and not want to act on it, because seeing your fellow teammates struggle to use your thing in some way is more motivating than the customer because you can kind of always say to the customer, " Well, they didn't really know," or "They have some special setup."

Jeff Weinstein (01:33:03):
Well, they didn't really know or they have some special setup. You probably shouldn't say those things, but you can kind of rationalize it, whereas a group of people incentivized to have actually accomplished it, who got together to do so painstakingly slowly not being able to do so if that's not what excites you as a product person to want to solve, this thing's not for you. But then again, you have your own organization system, you have your own things you need to ship and study group doesn't have a mandate that comes from it. We have our own. It's more of a cultural piece of information that is very high signal and then people tend to use that high signal for good prioritization. I will say though, that we have added the SLAs to certain bug levels that begin to match a bit of our incident process.

(01:34:01):
So in an incident strike, like in many companies, pencils down, fix the problem, severity levels, non-negotiable Slack rooms happen, war rooms, all that stuff. You don't want to do that with every single bug, but we have a rubric of craft related tags for our bug system. And if it is a sort of a P0 bug, which is not an incident, right, it doesn't mean to put down your pencils. You do need to acknowledge it at Stripe within seven days. And even if it doesn't mean to fix it, it's like a person looks at it and says, "Hey, we're going to do it or not do it." That's a still pretty strong bar for a non-incident related craft issue.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:45):
It feels just at Stripe, there's this cultural focus on we want to make the product great, we want to make the experience as great as possible. A lot of companies, it's just teams. We have this goal. We're not going to do anything that isn't driving this metric and goal that we have. And I think for teams like that, it's hard to hear just like, oh, someone's going to send you all of these problems that you experience. There's the negative version where the founders goes through the product like a CO of a larger company, just, oh my God, look at all these problems. You need to fix these immediately. And a lot of times it's completely distracting from the things they need to do, the goals they're trying to drive, things that really, really matter that the CO may not be thinking about. And it feels like you're trying to find this balance of here's problems that exist. You don't need to fix them. You probably should. Here's the most important stuff. But also there's often you find a correlation between make the experience better, you're going to do better.

Jeff Weinstein (01:35:37):
There's a huge amount of trust here involved in your colleagues, which is we want to provide teams great information and the best teams welcome that information. It doesn't mean that it comes with a auteur opinion from the outside world that says you must do X. We have a rubric on some of the craft related bugs, but again, we let the teams relabel them. And so maybe it's actually not a P0 from their eyes and that's the trust we put in the teams. I think that the failure mode is when you don't look. And so we need unnatural, safe, fun lore that gets us out of our chair and into the customer's mindset. Best is if it's you and you're your own customer, okay. Second best would be sitting right next to the customer in the outside world and then like, okay, fine, I'll take a third best, which is pantomime the customer and enforcing you don't use any internal knowledge. If you have practices in those three categories, I'm comfortable with the failure modes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:56):
I love that. This is definitely going to be the longest episode I've ever done, which is exactly what I expected and I'm happy that we're doing this.

Jeff Weinstein (01:37:04):
Everyone go 1.75X or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:07):
I like when people are like, oh, this episode is really good. I had to slow down to 1.75 or something. How are you even listening at that speed? No, it's 1.0 speed. That's what this episode needs to be. There's two more areas I want to spend some time on. One is Atlas. We've talked a lot about on the surface of Atlas. I want to help people understand what the hell it is and the stuff that's happening there. And two, I want to talk about getting stuff done at a big company, something that you've done at Stripe and I hear you have a lot of good advice on. So first of all, what is Atlas? We've talked a bit about it. What's the best way to understand what Atlas is and who it's for?

Jeff Weinstein (01:37:42):
In 2016, a bunch of Stripes were traveling the world, Stripes is what we call teammates here, and they're just hearing stories from entrepreneurs around the world. And you would hear this unbelievable story from incredible entrepreneurs who have a laptop, which is that they'd have to fly to the United States on an airplane to make a US company in order to get access to use financial system, to raise money from US or global investors, often to take USD or to charge US customers. And you could have sat around and said, huh, is that illegal? They don't live in the US. Can they have a US company? Absolutely. The US loves this. It is incredibly encouraged for people from around the world to make a US company and many people do.

(01:38:38):
Now, why did it require an airplane, right? And so you start to hear that kind of thing at a coffee shop amongst someone with a laptop who has access to the whole internet. And that is a burning problem. Right. That is not a tier three issue. I am not able to run my business without getting on an airplane should be sending alerts off in your whole psyche that you have discovered something important. And so I wasn't at Stripe at the time, but I'm very thankful that, I was running my own startup at the time. I was very thankful that the people at Stripe decided to try to tackle that problem. And so Atlas is a way to start a company in a few clicks, and we think that's an incredibly big deal because while there are smart humans across the whole planet, the opportunity that they have is not uniform. But it's a little strange because it's all the same MacBooks and it's a little strange because it's all the same IP addresses and we all have plenty of bandwidth and smarts.

(01:39:49):
And so what can we do to dramatically lower the barrier to great people solving problems? And we've found over and over again that increasing the ease and simplicity and decreasing the cost and complexity tends to lead to just more of that thing. And we have a fundamental belief that there should be more startups and they're not finite. And that belief comes from both just a core hope because there are so many problems in the world that don't seem to be being solved fast enough by our current institutions and larger companies that we think will actually, we need entrepreneurial energy to tackle them. And then it's also comes from experience of seeing it happened. Instacart signed up for Stripe with a Gmail address and then Covid happened and they delivered critical food to everyone when people were reasonably not allowed to go to the grocery store easily.

(01:40:53):
So you just don't know what the next Gmail address is going to do. And so in Atlas, we radically try to simplify the process of getting a company started and that mission has taken us to just solve more of the problem over time. And so over the last few years, for those who have either used Atlas or have started a company or maybe follow along on Twitter a bit, you might've seen just a progression of complexity that used to exist being automated. And so a big one that we did about a year ago was this 83(b) election, which is this absolutely Byzantine silliness system by which you have 30 calendar days to send a one-page document to the IRS that could radically change the economics of how you are incentivized as a founder. And this is not one of these greedy loophole. The IRS in the 1980s made this IRS rule in order to spur more entrepreneurship.

(01:42:07):
They want this. And the only issue is they made it extremely difficult to accomplish. You have to send a snail mail in to an IRS address in a particular format, in a particular way with no verification that it happened at all. And if you do it 31 calendar days, there's no redo. Okay. Now again, if you're a product person, you hear the founders terrified all day long about this same issue, just alarm bells in your head whole time. And so I had experienced it for myself as a founder several times, and I also just heard story after story and I just put on my to-do list for the team, we are going to solve this 83(b) election thing. And there are very good reasons not to do it because it comes with potential huge liability. Don't want to screw it up, it's snail mail.

(01:42:54):
You're really going to monetize this. It's a competitive advantage to do it. You can kind of argue yourself not to do it in a million ways. But again, back to the mission of just taking all of this complexity and turning into a single click. It was obvious to us and we got started on it. Infrastructurally, we've been automating these steps and when this podcast airs, I guess today, it will be true that when you go to start a company on Atlas, it will just be a single click.

(01:43:26):
You go to type in your friend's names, what the name of the company will be, it'll tell you if it's available automatically or not. You can split the company up 50, 50 or whatever you want to do, fill out a few things and you click go and then like a burrito coming to you, like a pizza tracker, we will just handle all of the downstream activities that used to be, hey, remember to come back in and purchase your shares. Why am I purchasing my shares? I'm just getting started. Why am I writing a check for $10 and putting into a bank account that I can't even open yet? And then I have to wait for that to be done to get the 83(b) [inaudible 01:44:09]. All of those steps are now just handled in the background so that we can get you ready for business in a day or two.

(01:44:17):
And so this is our vision. So you can quit your job on a Sunday night, get the Sunday scaries, I'm done with this thing, and on Monday morning fill out this form and the next day be able to run a billion-dollar business because we will have automatically handled getting you access to banking systems, to payment systems, to handling all the equity paperwork, filing your 83(b) election where you can just shift from having worrying about the company starting process to just building and shipping.

(01:44:52):
And you'll just get kind updates in the background. Cool, the IRS is giving you a tax ID. Cool, your 83(b) election is filed. Cool, all the founders have their equity and you're ready to go on the cap table. And we've done this by deeply integrating with the governments and deeply integrating with banking partners where we can get you access to the financial system before the IRS and the other governments come back with their sort of official yeses because we take care of the problem in the background by which we're faxing, phone calling, filling out forms on your behalf. And so we just want to take all that complexity and just erase it so that you get the same thing the YC group gets when they start, that checklist that they go through. We just have the robot do exactly the same thing.

(01:45:45):
And so in some ways it is a really big deal in a big ship because it completely automates the company starting process. But in other ways it's an incredibly incremental step that it's taken us three years to get to where we had to systematically automate the internal steps, each one and now we've done the work to wrap it all up into one button. And you can just watch how your company's doing in the dashboard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:16):
Well, first of all, congrats Jeff and the Atlas team on shipping this. I know this is a big milestone and it's been a long time coming.

Jeff Weinstein (01:46:21):
Yeah, Atlas was actually a little reasonable before we decided to do all this work. It's like why do this next step of completely automating it when it was actually fairly straightforward before. Atlas has above 80 NPS, which is quite high. Apple is in the low 60s, AirPods is 75. I love my AirPods. So Atlas in the 80s with almost 50% response rate is quite high. And so we still chose to do another year of work to automate all of this work behind the scenes because we see that companies are charging their customers sooner when they go through this automated process versus waiting. And it's a little strange. You just started your company. Well, what does it really matter to wait an extra seven days or 20 days before you can really get going on business? Those are really fragile days which you're building. And to some of our conversation earlier, that amazing feeling of getting your first customer and being in it with them and money actually exchanging hands and getting that relationship.

(01:47:34):
If we can slide that forward in the world by a couple of days or weeks, which we're seeing, like half the time it takes to get to your first customer, just shave a whole week off of your company and you can kind of see GDP being born sooner. And went my whole life knowing that okay, GDP is not finite and it can grow, but I've never really seen it and now I've actually seen it grow faster, sooner. And I think anything we could do to just move that forward is going to inspire and lower the bar for more people to be an entrepreneur because they'll see how satisfying that can be.

(01:48:21):
And another stat, which really was interesting to me recently is that we have seen since doing much of this automation work, that more solo founders are using Atlas than ever before. And I think it's because you can just do a lot more on the internet as a founder with no-code tools and everything else and get going. Very cool to see that bringing the best of the internet and making it available worldwide can be correlated with more people becoming entrepreneurs. And I think we should just keep doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:55):
It's incredibly inspiring and I think this is going to be a huge deal. It's hard to think about how many, what sorts of changes in tech could transform how many companies are started and how many companies not just started but actually happen because to your point, you may start and they're like, nah, nevermind a few days later if it's still stuck in some queue.

Jeff Weinstein (01:49:13):
Totally. And then you don't know where these things are going to go. We have the sort of cohort of 2024 startups in Atlas got to $50 million in revenue twice as quickly as the cohort in 2023. And so we kind of also think sometimes, oh, it was the pandemic that pushed everything online. Those are our best years. It's like we're seeing the earliest cohort charts of new startups just cracking up into the right. And that's very exciting because you also hear sometimes, well the funding market is down and valuations and this and that and the other. That is much more of a point in time capital analysis and much less business, like just how businesses are working day to day. It's really in the revenue that is representative of their futures and that looks amazingly bright.

(01:50:05):
And then of course these companies go off to do pretty wild things. Companies that have started through Atlas, there's been 55,000 of them to date are doing $5 billion a year in revenue. I think it actually resets their expectations of what other tools will be in the future. It's like, well, if it was so easy for me to get my company started, well why is it so hard to do banking? Well, thankfully there are some great services for it, but I think if we can push people towards expectations higher, then they will want to make their companies better and we'll just all benefit from that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:38):
How much of this is based on you guys sending faxes and sending mail yourself, like I don't know how much you can talk about the behind the scenes, but is there a lot of, through this ops element to automating some of this?

Jeff Weinstein (01:50:51):
Atlas is in total 10 people, which is I think a relatively small group for the role that it plays in the wider startup ecosystem. And we just don't pick up work we can't automate because we know that we need the leverage. And so we're not going to put ourselves in situations in which we have to compete to be the best. We're going to put ourselves in situations where we can automate it and be the only, and that's a different mindset. So in terms of why we picked up 83(b) election as a topic, when we made that decision, we made a commitment that we're going to do this forever. We're going to do this forever. This is a piece of infrastructure for the rest of the internet. That is a very high bar to set as the thing you're going to do.

(01:51:50):
And so we're happy to take our time. This is part, versus like go-go-go versus the long-term compounding. Go-go-go was when we assigned one engineer, hey, it's your job today to send one piece of paper to the office with this third party mail service. Why? Doesn't matter. Today, just send a single piece of paper to the office and an incredible engineer, and she went on to lead all of 83(b) election work. She sent it. And the proof of just receiving the piece of paper at the office that we had just sent yesterday is incredible proof. Right. We're like, well look. I mean, the 83(b) election is just sending this piece of paper to the IRS, like we just did it. Right.

(01:52:37):
That go-go-go as soon as possible was extremely useful because it's just like, look, this exists. We can do it. Come on. On the long-term compounding part, we were extremely serious about how we picked our third party vendors, and backup vendors, and what promises, and SLAs, and reporting systems, and alerts, and playbooks, and backup processes, like it's in a very intense amount of internal structure we use. But again, we have to look at where the value is. The value is in making sure it happens. Does it need to be us sending the mail? Does it need to be us talking to government? Not necessarily. And we have chosen to work with third parties and many backup third parties as well because one, there's expertise in the world of physically printing and sending mail that the 10 of us are not going to today become experts in. And two, I think it also causes us to build better software in that we now need to evaluate if something's actually working because it's happening externally.

(01:53:39):
Whereas when you build it yourself, again, you have this natural feeling, well, we built it. It must be working. Oh, later we'll add alerts. Later when there problems, we'll figure out playbooks. Well look, when it's a third party building it, you're like, wait a second. What happens if they screw up? Like cool, we better figure that out. We better OCR all the results. We better do all these check sums, we better... And it would be awesome if we could always treat our internal work that way, but because it was external, it forced us to be more rigid where we needed to be rigid and create interfaces and kind of commitments. And again, we work with a bunch of great third parties and back up third parties to execute this. And each year we write a document called Should We Do This Ourselves? And we look at the other nine of us around the room and go, of course we shouldn't. Let's go on to something else. So again, we're just really stitching it together, but ensuring that it happens.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:31):
Awesome. Okay. I was imagining fax machines just,-

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:34):
There are fax machines occurring. There are fax machines occurring,-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:37):
Not in the Stripe [inaudible 01:54:38].

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:38):
And there are phone calls being made and there are robots waiting on phones on hold as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:44):
Oh, amazing.

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:45):
There's quite a lot going on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:47):
AI is here. I saw a stat that one in six new Delaware corporations are now started on Stripe Atlas. That's absurd.

Jeff Weinstein (01:54:54):
Yep. I'm very excited to tell you when it's one in five, but it is not today.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:54:59):
Okay, sounds like we're close.

Jeff Weinstein (01:55:01):
We're on our way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:55:02):
Sounds like we're close. The other stat I have here is that the fastest growing cities for startups. Here's what I have, I don't know if you know this, but Boulder, Shenzhen, and Las Vegas.

Jeff Weinstein (01:55:13):
They're everywhere. One of the, it's like stat we kind of came up with a little bit last year that I'm just personally deeply obsessed with is founding teams in which the co-founders are in multiple countries. So we kind of nickname this. Again, it's like giving things a good title, headlines. Cross-Border Founders. Wow. More than 20% of multi-founder teams have at least one founder from another country. That is astounding to me, that the internet could bring people together like that. And I think that's going to provide more perspectives, more solutions will be local and global. Just all perspectives are great. And again, I think the Atlas team itself represents this. We were very intentional of how we built the Atlas team. It's majority women and we have more diversity to hire, but we're just very intentional to make it a team that had diverse perspectives. You've been on teams that don't have diverse perspectives of any type. They are so much worse. There's no real science necessary here. We just enforce that. We had the opportunity to build this team that way.

(01:56:36):
And it was really important to me that it represented a world we wanted things to look like and to represent. And it just had to be very intentional about it because I've made mistakes in my career previously where my startup was all men when we sold to box one of them. And on each hire it was harder and harder and harder to hire someone of a different background. Just naturally folks didn't want to join that type of team. And that was the last time I've ever going to make that mistake, which is that early the candidate poll must match where you want the team to go. It's not a down funnel problem, it is an up funnel problem. And where you have to just make sure that for each role you're comfortable with the distribution of people and backgrounds in your candidate pool and go from there. And I think that is one of the reasons why that 10 person group is so effective, is it has just a lot of diversity and perspective.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:57:38):
Another skill Jeff Weinstein is incredible at that I wasn't even aware of. We're going to add them to the list and I actually saw a photo of the team and I noticed that. And so great work. Is there anything else on Atlas that you wanted to share before I get into how you actually made Atlas happen at a company like Stripe that has a billion things to do?

Jeff Weinstein (01:57:55):
We just want to hear about what's hard for you. If you look back in your emails and if you started a company recently, you're starting a company right now, the whole world is counting on you to pick a customer, solve their problem 10 times better than their alternative, get it to them, charge for it, become economically viable and build a great business that provides great services. We are not counting on you to become experts at this silliness of administratively running your company. Imagine life without Google Docs where you'd have to hire an IT person to run your IT back end on employee three. You'd have an IT person or imagine the world without AWS for EC2 or S3 or any of these cloud services and you're racking computers yourself.

(01:58:46):
You're just absolutely not going to try as many things. We just see the company structure, the structure, bringing people together to be like that, and we want to automate more and more and more of it and turn it into software. So we're looking for the next things to work on. We have a couple ideas, but we expect to turn more of groups of people working together, that administration into software. And I think it's just going to unlock huge amount more people choosing to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:59:16):
Interesting. I'm so curious what that ends up being. If you really think about what you're doing here, if you believe that entrepreneurship and innovation and technology make the world better, you're creating such an unlock to allow more of that. And like I said, I think it's hard to imagine and think of other examples that could be as transformative and impactful as just making this process.

Jeff Weinstein (01:59:35):
It's funny because I go back to again, I also hear from founders, entrepreneurs like, oh, I can't think of an idea. Like, ah, I need a startup idea. And yet everything in the world is broken. And I also recall my first startup early 2010, 2012 ish, I joined a friend's company. That was started at the same time that the Stripe founders started Stripe. And that is, I think about that a lot because with the same information, knowing how hard it was to accept online payments, I chose to work on something else where they didn't. They worked on making it easy in seven lines of code to accept payments online, which turned out to be really useful.

(02:00:29):
So I really encourage people to be very sensitive to the problems that they see and just not let any little hiccup go unnoticed. And I think Atlas is really a manifestation of that, which is, let's actually look at every single thing. You went from hobby to economically successful operation and which of any moment along the way you shouldn't have had to do. And we think those things are a fair game to play with in any topic. I think that there are many more gigantic businesses, important things to be solved sitting in plain sight. I can't see them always, but when you hear, if you sit in enough silence and you hear the same people complain about problems, you too might find something as big as online payments are hard, which was sitting right in front of all of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01:24):
And I think it's important to note, it doesn't necessarily have to be a venture-backed, venture scale company. Right. There are many, most businesses in the world are non venture-backed, venture scale billion-dollar companies. You can build a profitable company.

Jeff Weinstein (02:01:36):
It's kind of funny. We've all put this badge of honor of giving away a lot of your company. People really love owning a lot of their company and being successful. So you just got to pick the right capital structure for your business.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:01:57):
And again, the amount of money that has been generated of the companies that started through Atlas, you said $5 billion, basically that's the GDP of Atlas. That Atlas is,-

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:07):
And that's like revenue per year and that's growing,-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:09):
Per year.

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:10):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:10):
Yeah. And obviously a lot of it would've happened anyway, but still it accelerated. It's probably growing faster. A lot of it probably never would've happened otherwise. Yeah.

Jeff Weinstein (02:02:19):
We ran a survey a little bit ago, we need to rerun this, where we just asked people would they have started their business without Atlas. And about 20% of people said they wouldn't have or wouldn't had then. And again, these things are fragile. Right. And it's not all Google employees leaving their job to the build something. It's people from every possible background, every possible role, every possible job, every possible age group who see problems and can solve it. So it's dramatically more fragile than people think.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:02:56):
Well, great work, Jeff, and team Atlas and Stripe in general.

Jeff Weinstein (02:03:00):
Fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:03:01):
Let's talk about one last thing. There's so many more things I still want to talk about. Maybe we'll have a,-

Jeff Weinstein (02:03:06):
We can go quick. Yeah, we can [inaudible 02:03:08].

Lenny Rachitsky (02:03:08):
Make it 2X speed. So Atlas is basically a zero to one product. I know you didn't start initially, it was there, but you took it from, I don't know, maybe you took it from 0.5 or something to one in 100 now, and a lot of people struggle with starting things like this within larger companies. Like Stripe's a large company, right? It's like a very innovative, well run company, but it's also a large company. And clearly you made shit happen, you and your team. What kind of things have you learned? Actually, let me read a quote. Here's a quote that kind of describes you being good at this from one of your former colleagues who will go unnamed. "Jeff is really good at cutting through the BS. You hear so much about frameworks and all this complicated stuff that people talk about, NPM circles, one of the most straightforward, obvious things probably right. I get so annoyed after calls with Jeff sometimes because I know he's right about something. I banged my head against the wall for months." And so talk about just what you've done, what you've learned about getting stuff done.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:04:03):
Talk about what you've done, what you've learned about getting stuff done at a large company. What do you need to do?

Jeff Weinstein (02:04:07):
Not having things be your idea I think is really powerful. I just talked to 50 customers who all yelled the same thing. Here they are in varieties of quotes and forms and the rest of it, and you put some three bullet points of strategy around why it's important, it's going to help you win more market share, and the rest of it and how you can do it well. Cool. What else could we want to do? Maybe somebody has something where 51 people have the same burning thing, but the majority failure mode is we do nothing. That's the majority failure mode. So one, aligning people with deep customer stories story boarding some solution visually with a Sharpie and not a pencil, not Figma initially, not high or low fidelity. I can never remember which one is the detailed one, but Sharpie. What is the unconstrained perfect solution to this burning problem?

(02:05:18):
That's Pixar-style storyboard. You don't need to be a designer. You can just draw stick figures on a piece of paper or whimsical or whatever you want to do. And with those things, if you're not asking for the sun and the moon on headcount and team size to make some forward progress, who could stop you? Let's get some first version working. It was very motivating to get that single piece of paper in the mail, which was blank, to kick us off on the 83(b) election. Again, by the time this podcast airs, we'll have crossed 10,000 83(b) elections filed, and we will have done them all 100.00% on time. With the burning use case, why customers are going to need it, why we can do it cheaply, effectively, safely over a long period of time, and here's the way to get tangible, forward progress quickly against the stick figure vision, but with something in the browser or one version of it. Let's just get one thing working one time.

(02:06:31):
I find proof of existence to be an incredibly powerful proof, rather than proof by theory or proof by debate. It's like, "Look, we did it one time. Hey, I'm holding the piece of paper." Pretty motivating. If we just printed out the right information, we'd be done. You're like, "Okay, actually there's a lot to do other than just that," but it really pushed us forward. Cutting through a little bit of the red tape is about momentum and making each step not such a big deal and asking for less permission. Then of course, once you have a little bit of that under your belt, you're going to naturally be trusted with taking more of those kinds of bets.

(02:07:24):
Paired with some of the things we talked about earlier of everyone's looking at the same place about the metrics, everyone can watch the success. We don't need to do big, internal updates with long-winded PowerPoint presentations and scrambles the night before. You can just go to the metrics page and see how we're doing. That brings so much trust to the group that people start going from, "Why do we have this Atlas thing that doesn't really produce so much money. It's charging companies when they don't have money. We're a big payments business. How do you even compare these things?" To "Wow, look at the progress that they're making against the mission, and look at its impact on the curves." And you start to root for it more.

(02:08:16):
I think that's how we got it there. I will say one other thing, which is that making something economically viable is extremely important. I am probably the fourth person to run Atlas, and it's quite a pantheon of people prior to me, including the founder of Mozi, which is a compliance startup, Watershed, which is this amazing climate reporting tool, also led Atlas, Patrick McKenzie, patio11, for many folks who [inaudible 02:08:46]

Lenny Rachitsky (02:08:46):
Wow, what an alumni group, this collection.

Jeff Weinstein (02:08:48):
We owe ourselves a dinner. We owe ourselves a dinner. Quite a group. And now we have a new person. I technically no longer lead Atlas, so we've hired up a whole team, which is really exciting. And Hayley Halvarsson, who's joined us about a year or two ago, she leads Atlas now and you can find her on Twitter. She's fantastic. We swap jobs over a course of a year, just one month at a time, the roles. And so she worked for me, then I worked for her, and she's gone off to hire some amazing people to run Atlas. So it's really quite a privilege to have these people lead it over time.

(02:09:22):
But it was really important for us to communicate why we were going to run this in an economically viable way, and I think that applies to all products and all businesses. It's like, "Look, if you're a customer acquisition-style product, showcase why this is the best customer acquisition for the dollar for the company. If you are a margin-generating, moat-creating, ecosystem-growing portion of the business, then your metrics have to show it." So you can't just have half the story of just the product quality and the tweets. You have to have the economics. Who else is going to put this much energy into this style of product and that gives us confidence that we should invest it in the long term? Because alternatives can come and go, and I super encourage there to be more Atlas alternatives. That'd be great for founders, but I think over the long term, it'll be difficult to do so because of the business model.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:10:19):
There actually was an alternative at one point, AngelList, and then they're like, "No, Stripe is killing it. Let's just send everyone to Atlas."

Jeff Weinstein (02:10:26):
I had worked on Stripe payments for a while, and I had just started on Atlas, and I think that same month AngelList announced that they were doing incorporation and banking and cap table all together, which was exactly what I wanted to do. I was like, "Oh shoot, did I sign up for the wrong thing? AngelList is such a smart group of people, so customer-oriented, great brand, I love many of the people that work there, they work with some of the best legal minds, and they have the RUV setup. There's so much awesomeness here." I was like, " Should we really compete? What should we do here?" And we thought about it more and more like, "Look, in the very long term, this company-starting process is going to become a efficiency cost problem, and there's so much long tail complexity with dealing with multiple financial institutions, multiple government processes, all of this legal complexity, and it's difficult to charge a lot of money for it because it's hard to charge people money when they haven't even started the business yet."

(02:11:36):
We looked at it and said, "Look, we're going to keep this long-term, compounding approach because we think that this is where it's going to go." And it was a zero interest rate environment at the time. AngelList built a phenomenal product. I looked at it with nothing but admiration and happiness, but it also smarted and hurt. We kept building, kept building, kept building, and I got a phone call one night, on my wife's birthday before we sat down for dinner, and it was Dan at AngelList, I hope he'd be comfortable telling the story, who I love. Incredible product mind and he led product over AngelList for startups. He said, "We're going to get out of incorporation. This is not going to be our focus going forward. Do you want the business?"

(02:12:28):
That was like a year and a half after they had really gone out, or maybe two years after they'd gone out, or something like this. I was like, "Wow." We had kept such an open relationship with them. We had paired with them on legal constructs. We had discussed 83(b) election openly. A lot of people were like, "I can't believe you're talking to the competitor." Look, we all share the same mission here. Yes, we're competing, but are we really all better off from treating each other at arm's distance? We had a shared Slack channel. We discussed when the Delaware was slow on incorporation. One time is because they were playing softball and they had an afternoon off. That's a real story, and we've discussed it. AngelList was incredible in how they evaluated it. We're evaluating different partners, but because of our working relationship and the quality of your product, and they saw we were going with 83(b) election and the intensity of that, they just put up a webpage that said to get started with AngelList, if you need a company, go right over to Atlas.

(02:13:36):
That was a really amazing moment because I respected them so much and I looked up to them so much that they would mutually beneficially choose to do that. And everybody was excited and happy, and customers are happy, and it's been an incredible relationship since, in which you can start on AngelList, go through Atlas, and then all of your information is automatically populated into AngelList automatically. We've since rolled that out with several other partners, Mercury, Carta, others, but AngelList really led the way there, and we maintain a great relationship with the team. It took a while, but it really reproved to me that they're not competitors. It's alternatives, and if you care about your customer, you care about their alternatives, and if you care about the mission, you need to all work together. Look, there's some friendly competition, of course. We all want to win, but in the long term, I think all parties are significantly better off.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:14:31):
Wow, that is an awesome story. I don't know if you've shared that anywhere else. There's so many lessons there that I could spin off on and... Not worrying about competition, staying heads down, just solving customer problems, staying close to your competition, not being afraid to talk to them, sharing advice with each other, just building the best possible product. I don't know, there's a ton there that's super interesting.

Jeff Weinstein (02:14:52):
I couldn't really draw it up any better, and I think the world is better off with more specialization, and it's a pain in the butt to do these incorporations. I think you want more specialization and more partnership, and I think a lot of companies are starting to do that now.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:15:12):
Let me go back to the lessons you shared on how to build something new at a big company, then we can wrap up. I took a bunch of notes here, and these are awesome and they actually resonate a lot with Mihika, who came on the podcast, who's at Figma, been the person building a lot of zero-to-one stuff. So it's nice that there's these trends that are coming up again and again.

(02:15:32):
One tip is storyboard the ideal. With a Sharpie, draw out, "Here's this exciting vision of what this could be if we were to pull it off without constraints." Unconstrained, powerful vision. Two is solve a burning use case. Make it clear this is a huge problem for a lot of people. There's probably stories you share there. Show tangible forward progress like, "Look at this, we made this progress, we made this progress. Sent ourselves a piece of blank paper. Look at this, it's a huge milestone." And have momentum, and Mihika talked about this. Keep the fire alive. Keep the fire alive, show momentum. We're making progress. This metrics moving up into the right. Then there's a milestone... Felt like you had an early milestone of like, "Look, we made progress," and then also, have the business case, basically. "Look how much we could make and look what this could be if we were to succeed." Anything you'd add there? Anything you'd correct?

Jeff Weinstein (02:16:22):
Bringing the earliest customers into the room with your team as soon as humanly possible. We would just invite a founder to the team meeting. We would pipe all their feedback into a Slack channel automatically. We have all the NPS scores going to a channel, and anytime it's not a 10 for 10, we follow up directly. Constant engagement with a customer creates the momentum where it doesn't need to be the product person or some other leader saying, "We need to do this. Follow me." It's, "Oh my gosh, the world needs this. Let's figure out how to do it even faster."

(02:17:06):
And a tip that the team has tried, and this is well since I've been involved day-to-day, is literally inviting customers in to design the product, which I'd actually never heard of. "Hey, we're thinking about what happens after incorporation now and what can we do to help founders after they've set up their company? What would be magical there?" We just invite founders in, into a Whimsical, a piece of software I love. It's a really easy learning curve to create visual diagrams. And rather than doing a UXR about it, we just say, "What would you hope this dashboard would have?" And they'd grab a thing, and they start typing, and they start drawing what they want their dashboard to be. Why were we guessing beforehand? I now scratch my head. I'm several years into a decade-plus building things and I was like, "I doing this by myself. Why didn't I just assign it to the people who are going to use it in the first place?"

(02:18:01):
Now look, that doesn't always work because not all of your customers are going to be product designers at heart, but more of them than you think, and I think it's giving your customers write access, and not just read access, to your company is incredibly powerful. I think I had not quite seen it so directly where you just actually designed what they want, but I saw a diagram of something we're working on right now. I was like, "Wow, we haven't even had design look at it." They're like, "No, actually the customer drew it." Great. Why were we guessing?

Lenny Rachitsky (02:18:35):
I think you have an unfair advantage where your customers are founders and oftentimes have product skills and design skills, but I love that [inaudible 02:18:43].

Jeff Weinstein (02:18:43):
It's true, but I will really push, because you don't need a hundred of them and you'll find somebody somewhere who knows. You just got to sit in a little more silence. They'll raise their hand.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:18:55):
There's a quote you shared somewhere that relates to what you just said that your dad once said, "You can screw up a sentence if it begins with 'The customer.'"

Jeff Weinstein (02:19:03):
That's true. Yeah, my dad runs an IT business in Baltimore to help other businesses with their computer systems. Growing up, I would literally, physically clean the keyboards of his employees and dust the mice. But yeah, he's very, very customer-oriented, where I get a lot of it from, and my mom's a painter, so I think there's some combination of talents or interests there. He would take it one step further, and he sometimes physically bring a chair over in a meeting and say, "The customer is sitting here," and you'd have to pretend. Then he would fake talk to the invisible customer. "Based on what you've seen today at the meeting..." I saw him do this one time. "Based on what you've seen today at the meeting, are you more likely to pay your bill or less likely to pay your bill based on what you witnessed?"

(02:19:55):
That's a little intense on the pantomime, but I think the point gets across that... Again, because it's so natural to think internal, if you begin the sentence physically with "The customer" then start your sentence, you just have a much better shot at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:09):
That's an amazing story. Very a study group-ish, like an early prototype. Jeff, we've covered so much ground. I have two hours more worth of questions, but we need to-

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:21):
Let's lock.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:22):
We need to cut it off, I think. Is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:31):
Really excited about whatever you're building out there, thinking of building. My email address is incredibly easy to find. My Twitter handle is incredibly easy to find. Do not hesitate to send me cold emails. My love language is Loom videos of bugs, but feel free to send anything you have off the top of your head. I respond to good cold emails. Don't hesitate.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:20:51):
What's the email, real quick, for people?

Jeff Weinstein (02:20:53):
If finding my email address is your issue? It can't possibly be, but it is my first initial and last name at basically everything in the world, though my handle on Twitter is jeff_weinstein, but gosh, if you can't find my email address then you got a bigger problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:21:07):
Okay, we'll link to it in the show notes, as well. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready? Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jeff Weinstein (02:21:20):
I know a lot of people on this podcast recommend high-output management, but it should be swap the Bible out for it at all the hotels in the world, in the little drawer. Put it everywhere. You can't go wrong, though. It is an incredible clarity of how to spend your time as a leader, a manager of other people, a very high bar for how evaluating your work as the sum everyone around you. That was very clarifying to me that it's not an individual effort, it is the sum of everything I'm involved in is how to measure it. So that's definitely up there. A nice pair to that book, as a amuse-bouche afterwards, is Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool's Guide to Surviving with Grace, I think, is the full exact title by Gordon MacKenzie, which is the story of a illustrator at Hallmark, the greeting card company, and it turns out to be a, again, bureaucratic, slow-moving organization that, over time, added rules and policies and rules and policies and quelled creativity and innovation, which is surprising at a greeting card company, but it existed. So this is his incredibly well-drawn book, as you'd imagine, with beautiful illustrations about how he orbited the hairball of the organization to inspire others, keep himself engaged, and to bring creativity and excitement and trying to pull people off the hairball as he orbited it. So I think it's a fun afternoon read with beautiful illustrations about how to stay sane at big companies and where to be a little goofy and take the advantage and gravity of the hairball, but not be succumbed by it and to be able to orbit it.

(02:23:22):
Those two are really fun. I will say one other one I like... Because we haven't talked about strategy here, there's been more getting stuff done and some other tactical things, but 7 Powers, and I know you had the author recently on, which was awesome. I won't explain the book, you just watch the podcast of it, but it walks through many of the business powers and moats a company can have. I ran into the author...

Lenny Rachitsky (02:23:55):
Hamilton Helmer.

Jeff Weinstein (02:23:56):
Hamilton Helmer, yes, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:23:57):
What a cool name.

Jeff Weinstein (02:23:58):
Very cool name. Alliterative. At the Box lunchroom one time, where I worked at Box, they acquired one of our companies, and I was like, "Any luck finding the eighth power?" He was like, "I'm looking, I'm looking," as he ran off with his sandwich. One other funny, somewhat embarrassing moment about that book is when I was applying to work at Stripe, I was in some email conversation with our CEO, Patrick Collison, who is quite well-read and enjoys books, and I was trying to showcase, " I like books a little bit," though not at any level of him. And I had mentioned I just finished reading 7 Powers, and I recommended it to him, but it joke's on me because he's quoted in the foreword that I had skipped. So he was very kind to let me know that he had read it and he is quoted in it, so I was like, "Oh shoot, maybe I won't get the job." But I got through that part, at least. So those books have spoken to me. Do you have a favorite power, by the way, Lenny? Do you have a favorite power?

Lenny Rachitsky (02:24:57):
His favorite power is counter-positioning. I also like that power a lot because I think it's the one you can that really changes everything about how you build your company, so that's the one that always stands out to me. How about you?

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:07):
I like counter-positioning also, and Atlas with going cheap and that audience is counter-positioning, but I really enjoy process, the process power, because it is very difficult to, as an organization, get good at anything, and if you could do that over a long period of time in a sustainable way, you have a power.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:26):
This is the nerdiest chat I've ever had. Which is your favorite 7th Power? I love it. But on that power, I asked him about it. He makes a really strong point there, that rarely is it actually a power for people. They think the way we execute is going to be our advantage and rarely is it actually a power. Usually people can copy it, but when you nail it...

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:47):
That's even better, because then if your competition thinks they have it-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:50):
Yeah, exactly.

Jeff Weinstein (02:25:51):
They won't invest than the other one. So I like it even more, for that reason.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:25:54):
I love it. But I was going to say with Patrick Collison being quoted in the book, not only was he wrote part of the forward or was quoted, he basically credited 7 Powers of helping build Stripe. No big deal.

Jeff Weinstein (02:26:07):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:26:08):
This lightning around is going great. This is a very microcosm of our whole chat so far. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jeff Weinstein (02:26:17):
How To with John Wilson. It's on HBO. For those who haven't seen it, not really giving away anything because it's just wild when you watch it. You can't give it away. This videographer has found footage where he's just walking through Manhattan, and other parts of the country, but mostly New York, with a camera for 10 years, just filming intensely weird things. And if you've spent any time in New York, there's plenty to film. Then has put together this narrative afterwards about certain topics like how to make risotto or how to take out the trash or how to...

(02:26:53):
It's a way of seeing life through the eyes of these vignettes, diving down and really understanding people, and he does it through this incredibly dry humor of stitching together this video footage to tell a different narrative. And I think some of it is that we used to live in New York, and I love living in California, but I miss that frequency of strangeness, and you can see that through that TV show. Fantastic.

(02:27:26):
Movie? I recently watched The Quiet Girl, which is a film about a young Irish girl who is from a dysfunctional home and has this opportunity to live with a family friend who have more opportunity for her, more empathetic to her, and it showcases, again, how fragile things are. It's a very intense film, but there's something beautiful in how much opportunity was in front of this young girl. It is a tearjerker, but a great one.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:28:05):
Do you have a favorite product you have recently discovered that you love?

Jeff Weinstein (02:28:11):
I love my computer. I'm fast at my computer. Being fast at my computer helps me just go from intention to just out in the world. I've fallen back in love with Raycast, which is an automation tool for those who have watched the journey of Spotlight and Quicksilver and Alfred and all these automator services. Raycast seems to have cracked the nut on automation, nerd complexity, but also UI ease and some nice touches and loads quickly, does the basics. It's fully programmable, extensible, just a huge fan of Raycast. And then I think for product people, if you don't have CleanShot installed for screenshots, you're behind the curve. Being able to take a screenshot and blur particular things or point at stuff or have arrows and lines and have that be second nature, fast, instantaneous is so useful to be able to communicate what you're seeing. When I get a new laptop, it's Raycast first and CleanShot second.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:10):
Wow, I am going to download CleanShot immediately.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:13):
Yes, it's extremely-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:15):
I've not heard of it. I've been using Skitch as my blurrings.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:18):
As much as I appreciate the Skitch folks, CleanShot is an incredible piece of software.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:22):
Amazing. I'm going to do that. All right, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:30):
I don't even realize I say "Go Go Go" a lot, but I do. I actually say it and write it so people I hear that they'll later say, "Go Go Go" back to me. I'm like, "Huh? Don't I say that sometimes?" "Yes, you say it a lot." So apparently, "Go Go Go" is one of them. I also-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:29:45):
I love that.

Jeff Weinstein (02:29:46):
Say, "Let's make some mistakes," when we're brainstorming something or sitting at a sushi restaurant and talk sushi guy or gal, to showcase, "Let's be creative. Do whatever you want. No pretense. I'm not evaluating anything. Let's make some mistakes." It's just a weird thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:08):
They're so good. I'm going to use that for my podcast guests. "Let's just make some mistakes. Don't worry about it."

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:14):
At that point, everyone's like, "What? Okay, fine. Sure. Cool."

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:17):
I like the combo of those two, "Go go go, let's just make some mistakes while we're going."

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:21):
You have to use it in certain circumstances and not for the five nines of reliability on our API, but it does have its place.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:30:29):
Final question. You worked with Patrick Collison and John Collison for many years. I'm curious what the most useful feedback or advice you have heard from them or learned from them?

Jeff Weinstein (02:30:40):
On my first month working here, which I guess is six, seven years ago now, they had put me in charge of our payments infrastructure services. That's all the backend systems that communicate with the financial system and all the internal APIs where we build the external APIs and products on top of, so quite a lot of stuff. I knew nothing about finance. I knew nothing about the scale that we're talking about. They entrusted me, somewhat insanely, with that responsibility. On the first month we had our quarterly business review where... The normal quarterly process, and I was like, "Okay, cool. I'll do the next one. I'll write the next one." I've been here one month. They're like, "No, you write it. It'll be even better that you write it." It's like, oh my God. It's forcing me to have to, in the fourth week, have that catalyst to understand the whole business and with the permission, because I was going to have to write this doc about how we're doing. The company had been in existence for seven years before I got here. It was already at some reasonable scale.

(02:31:54):
It was an intense operation, and I remember writing the first draft and sending it to him because it was... I didn't want to send... He had pushed me to do it a bit, and I figured I'd give him an early draft and he wrote back, "This doesn't sound like you yet." The willingness to entrust a new person to provide their own perspective and bring it into a very formalized document like that was an impressive... That really spoke to me, and I rewrote it completely, and I made it sound like me, and I've tried to make things sound like me since.

(02:32:29):
John's is more of a gut punch, I'll say. I reported to John, the co-founder. Maybe nine months into reporting to him, I would run around with a clipboard. I was a little bit manic of getting a lot done. A lot going on at Stripe at the time. We'd have a one-hour one-on-one, I'd be listing all of the things that we had accomplished and the problems we have and where we need escalation help and where we're stuck and all this that and the other. Lots of stuff. I had checklists and physical paper, flipping it over a little bit frantically. And he said, "You are one of the best people I've ever worked with at solving problems three through 100, but I need you stuck on problems one and two."

(02:33:22):
Oh man, that hurt. I was like, "Oh, shoot." I am productive on the non-hardest problems and I was trying to mask, not on purpose mask, but who wants to be stuck on something so hard when there's so much else to do? From then on, I would show up to him with problems one and two and not talk about problems three through 100. Even if we were working on them, we would just not talk about them and we would get stuck on problems one and two. That was phenomenal advice, which I was like, "Oh, shoot, I'm going to be fired." But it was really a deeply impactful sentence.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:03):
Wow, what a powerful, great, helpful... That's great advice [inaudible 02:34:10] right there.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:10):
He really looked my soul and-

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:12):
Yeah, I love this.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:13):
Like a street fighter style or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:16):
But to your point, very impactful and helpful.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:18):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:20):
Jeff, we did it. The archeology is complete.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:23):
I appreciate the time, Lenny. It was fun. I don't do too many of these, so I'm curious to people's feedback and really appreciate the questions.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:34:30):
Amazing. Jeff, thank you so much for being here.

Jeff Weinstein (02:34:33):
Appreciate it, Lenny.

# The paths to power: How to grow your influence and advance your career | Jeffrey Pfeffer (Stanford)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're going to be talking about how to grow your power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:02):
The reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:15):
Not only is, but how it was and how it will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
The Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:32):
This is not about personality. These are skills they can be mastered.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
People might be hearing this and they're like, "I don't want to be this person."

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:38):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one. That is one way to get in our own way. If I think power is dirty, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
The opening quote to your book that I have here, if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:58):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford's graduate School of Business, and teaches one of the two most popular and oversubscribed courses in all of the MBA program, called the Paths to Power. The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it. In our conversation, we dig into each of the seven powers, why it's important to build these skills even if you feel uncomfortable.

(00:01:48):
We talk through a bunch of examples of the power in action and the impact it has had on people's lives, why it isn't as cringey or scary as you may think. I was actually nervous to have this conversation and I ended up being a huge fan of Jeffrey and the work that he does. We end the conversation with what you can start doing today to start building your own power. This podcast is basically for anyone that wants to advance in their career, whether you're an IC or a CEO, and I'm really excited to bring it to you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:02:36):
Thank you, Lenny. I am honored that you invited me on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
I'm even more honored that you decided to come on. We're going to be talking about something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. I think it's going to make me uncomfortable. We're going to be talking about how to grow your power in life and in business. Let me just start by asking why does this stuff make people uncomfortable, and why is it still important for people to learn how to do this well?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:02):
Well, it's important because a guy named Gerald Ferris developed a scale of political skill. And he and a bunch of his colleagues over the years did a lot of empirical research that demonstrates that political skill is associated with a lot of positive outcomes, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being happy in your job, being less stressed. So the reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things. The reason why it makes people uncomfortable. You said it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should ask you the question, why does it make you uncomfortable?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:44):
There's a lot of things here that are probably not how people want to live their life necessarily, or want other people to act.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:51):
Yeah, so I think it makes people uncomfortable because the realities of what it takes to get power bear almost no resemblance to what you're taught in Sunday school or the mosque or wherever, how your parents raised you. They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:56):
You also have this quote that the people who need to understand power and build their power skills are people who come from backgrounds or characteristics who would normally put them at a disadvantage.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:05:04):
I think that's exactly right. I will go this Sunday to Nashville Tennessee to talk to a bunch of people of color in the NFL who are trying to rise up the ranks. Stanford runs a program because the NFL is serious, I think, about trying to make more opportunity for people, underrepresented minorities. But these are folks who will not succeed unless they learn power skills, because the world is stacked against them in lots of ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):

(00:07:51):
Another element of your course that you try to make clear in your syllabus is to teach people not to be as judgmental. You also have this whole huge bold phrase, "This class is not for everyone." Can you just talk a bit about maybe why it's not for everyone and then why being less judgmental is important?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:08:07):
The class is extremely popular. I have a long waiting list. It's kind of mythical. And because of the principle of social influence, we are influenced by what other people do. We're influenced in our choices of restaurants, we're influenced in our choices of music. I'm not sure I like Taylor Swift, but I certainly want to go see Taylor Swift because everybody else is. And many people sign up for the class. And one year in particular, there were some people who sat in about the third row up, directly in front of me, and they looked every day like they were having some terrible thing put up some horrible orifice or something. They looked literally in pain, and so I decided, and of course they learned nothing. If you come to the class and you're in that much psychological discomfort, you're not going to learn anything.

(00:08:55):
And so what I try to do is tell people that in order to benefit from this class, you have to be open to learning the material. And if you're not, and by the way, this would be true for any class. If you go to physics and you say, I don't like physics, I hate physics, I don't believe in physics, I don't believe in the theory of physics, whatever, you're not going to learn anything. And so I'm trying to get the class, given those huge waiting lists, I'm trying to get the class to have people in it who are in fact going to benefit from it rather than sit there and look like they're in pain. And the judgmental thing, if Matthew 7, "Judge not that ye be not judged." The Koran says, "Only Allah can judge people." The American poet, Walt Whitman said, "Be curious, not judgmental."

(00:09:46):
Mother Teresa said, "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." Judgment, if I need to build a positive relationship with Lenny because you are on my critical path in my job, and jobs necessarily entail a reasonable amount of interdependence, I get things done through and with other people. If I decide that Lenny is whatever set of bad adjectives you want to use, dumb, incompetent, immoral, whatever, my ability to build a positive relationship with you, and you remain on my critical path, becomes almost zero unless you're a better actor or I'm a better actor than I think most people are.

(00:10:32):
So therefore, you should suspend judgment in the sense that if somebody is on your critical path, the only judgment you should make is they're on my critical path. If I want to get something done, I need their collaboration and cooperation, and the fact that I may not like them is in fact irrelevant. And as I have taught senior executives over the years, it is absolutely clear to me that one of the skills that they have mastered is they have a skill that you cannot tell what they think of you. And that's important because I need your collaboration, I need your cooperation. And if I leak out in ways that say I don't respect you or I don't like you, I don't admire you, whatever, my odds of getting you to work productively with me goes essentially to zero. So that's a judgmental story. Does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:21):
Absolutely. And I have a quote from your syllabus along these lines, "Not everyone we encounter in Paths to Power is someone you're going to want to emulate. This is a class about how to get things done, how to build and wield influence, and there are multiple ways to accomplish these objectives." So I've had two friends actually go through the course. One I asked about the course of the impact it had on her. She's actually a founder now. And she told me that your class was her single most favorite class at all of Stanford Business School, because it was realistic and applicable to life as a founder. Because it didn't sugarcoat business, didn't sugarcoat life. It told her how the world really works and it is helping her succeed with her startup right now.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:00):
Thank you. There's no higher praise than that. I actually don't read, I shouldn't probably say this on the public, but I don't actually read my course evaluations because the impact I want to have is not to have people like me, but to have that kind of impact. To make people more successful, more effective in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
That is a good segue to one of your rules of power. So let's just talk about your Seven Rules of Power. I actually have your book right here and if folks want to learn more, here it is, Seven Rules of Power. This is your fourth book about power, and this is your best book about power, because it basically summarizes everything you've learned in a really cohesive way. So let me first share the Seven Rules of Power and then I'm going to dive into a few of them. Does that sound good?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:44):
That sounds perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:45):
Okay, so the seven rules, one, get out of your own way. Two, break the rules. Three, appear powerful. Four, build a powerful brand. Network relentlessly. Use your power, and success excuses almost...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:01):
Everything, correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
Okay, success excuses everything almost. Got it. Okay. So let me start with power four, which is around personal brand. And the reason I want to start here is I have a friend that's actually in your class right now, Ralph, and I saw that he started a podcast. And he told me that he did it because it was part of the homework that you give students. You call it Doing Power. Is that the name of the homework assignments?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:25):
Yeah, I have. So we give them a bunch of assignments throughout the class, which are self-reflective assignments, but their big thing for the class is they have to do power. They have to do something during the quarter to take the principles of the class, and what they're learning, and put them into practice. And that is because everything I do, I do for a reason. That is because if you don't use what you learn, the learning will disappear. So if you go to a French class and you learn French, and you never speak French, in about a relatively short period of time you'll forget everything you learn. And so I want the learning to stick with them, so I try to get them to do something with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):
While we're on this tangent, I wanted to talk about this whole, you have a book, the Doing Knowing Gap.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:10):
Knowing-Doing Gap.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
The Knowing-Doing Gap. So let's just spend a little time there. I think that's really important. What are some examples of things that have come out of people doing these homework assignments, things that maybe led to something interesting?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:22):
Let me take my most extreme example. My most extreme example is probably Derek Kan, K-A-N. And Derek Kan was a little bit older when he went through the MBA program. And in 2012, his Doing Power project was to get appointed to be Mitt Romney's, it was Mitt Romney was running for president, to be head of economic policy for the Romney campaign. Believe it or not, he was offered the job. Believe it or not, he turned it down for reasons which we could go into if you want, but aren't that interesting. He wound up relatively soon thereafter as number three in the transportation department, working for Elaine Chao. And I have a picture of him when he comes to the class, I introduce him. I tell students, I give them a trigger warning and I introduce him. He wound up, at the end of the Trump administration, as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. And since typical of the Trump administration, by that time there was no director. He essentially ran the $6 trillion US budget. This is six years out of business school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
I was thinking whether he got that during his class. Amazing. Okay, so this is a success story of Doing Power. Let's talk about this first power of building brand, and I think this is where people start to feel uncomfortable. They're going to be like, oh no, I don't want to be doing this. This doesn't feel good to me.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:51):
Why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):
So let's talk about it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:53):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):
Let's see. So talk about this power of building a personal brand.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:58):
There are by definition fewer positions at the top than at the bottom. The world, we might not like this, and I know people, the late Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tried to do holacracy or whatever, but the world is essentially hierarchical. The animal kingdom is hierarchical. It is better to be at the top than at the bottom for a number of reasons. Okay. If that is true, if there are fewer positions at the top and then at the bottom, then your job to advance your career is to figure out how to get promoted. There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are. So it is not sufficient for them to know who you are. They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you.

(00:16:52):
If they don't know you, you cannot choose what is not in your head. You know that better than I do. So therefore you have to do something to differentiate yourself. You have to build a brand. So when I think of Lenny in your podcast, I think of something. Not just 25 billion podcasts. When I think of somebody in McKinsey or Bay or BCG, one of the consulting firms, a gazillion people start off as front-line consultants. What are you going to do so that somebody knows who you are? What are you going to do that creates value for the firm and for you? So my friend Keith Ferazzi, when he started at Deloitte Consulting, did not do the spreadsheet stuff that he was, by the way, not very good at and didn't like. He started the Lincoln Quality Award. He decided to try to take Deloitte's brand recognition from about one or 2% to 30%.

(00:17:54):
He was appointed, though he left before he actually took the job, to the position of partner and the first chief marketing officer at Deloitte. I have another friend, Tristan Walker, who wanted to get hired at Foursquare. He sent emails to the founder. The founder ignored him. So Tristan Walker did something I think very bold. Tristan Walker began signing up partnerships. So one day the founder says, holy God, he signed up Starbucks. Maybe I ought to hire this guy. So you have to do something that causes people to know who you are, and that is what building a brand is about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
It sounds very benign put that way. When people hear, I need to build a personal brand, it sounds like I need to post on LinkedIn, I need to post on Twitter, start a newsletter, start a podcast, which I know is kind of a part of it. But what are some examples you've seen of ways to build a personal brand that are effective?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:18:50):
So I have a friend who I bring to the class, a lovely tall Asian woman named Laura Chau, who made partner at a venture capital firm after four years, which is fast. Laura works for Canaan Partners, C-A-N-A-A-N. Laura said, I do not work for Andreessen Horowitz, I do not work for Sequoia, I don't work for Greylock, I don't work for any of these very visible large VC firms. So if I am going to get deals in the consumer space, that's her domain of expertise is consumer and consumer tech, somebody is going to have to know who Laura Chau is. Because again, you're not going to get the deal if nobody knows who you are. And so she basically did everything you talked about. She did writing. She started a podcast in which she invited influential people on. She contributed to a book. She helped people out.

(00:19:55):
She did networking dinners. She did everything she could so that people would recognize and know Laura Chau. And one of the things she did was she's tall. In general, Asian women are not tall. She decided to play up the fact that she was, in the words of some people, the tallest Asian woman they'd ever seen. She wears heels. In her heels she's six feet one inches tall. She also, when she comes to my class, many people come to my class with hoodies, God knows what. She has style and it's a unique style. So she thinks about very strategically, how am I going to dress? How am I going to look? How am I going to show up? How am I going to do what I need to do so that people know who I am? Obviously there's substance. If you have visibility without substance, people will know you're useless. But if you have substance without visibility, no one will know the substance that you got.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:56):
You also talk about how you can reframe this idea of not being self-promotional, but it's amplifying the impact of the team that I work with, or it's me scaling myself by sharing things I know and pointing people to it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:11):
Absolutely, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
Awesome. Okay, let's move on to a different power. Let's talk about power one, which is getting out of your own way. Talk about what that means and how someone can work on that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:20):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one by talking about how this is the topic that makes people uncomfortable. And when something makes people uncomfortable, in general, they're going to shy away from it. So if I think power is dirty, if I think power is evil, if I think power is something I want nothing to do with, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career. So that is one way in which we get in our own way. Another way in which we get in our own way, many people suffer from what is called in the psychology literature, imposter syndrome. They believe that they were the admissions mistake at Stanford. They were the hiring mistake in whatever company they're working for. That somehow they got to this job, but they don't really deserve to be there because they're surrounded by people who are smarter and better than them, and therefore they will do things.

(00:22:18):
I can't even believe that this goes on. So I will have students, not many, but a few. Now raise their hand, I'll call them, and the first things out of their mouth will be, I don't know if this comment is going to be useful. This is called pre-emptory apology. If the comment is not going to be useful, don't say it. That's number one, but number two, don't apologize. Pardon me for interrupting. Pardon me for taking up your time. Stop all this apologizing. If you got the job you're in, you probably are not only qualified, you're probably overqualified. So don't use descriptors of yourself that disempower you. Don't think of yourself as not deserving of the job that you hold, because that attitude will leak out and other people will say, if Lenny doesn't think he deserved the job, then maybe I shouldn't think he deserves the job either.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:19):
So basically the first power is you're shooting yourself in the foot by worrying too much about whether people like you. This friend of mine who's now the founder that I read some quotes from, she said her number one takeaway from your class is if you want to be liked, get a dog.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:23:32):
That's correct. That is a quote from my dear friend Gary Loveman, who for many years ran Harrah's, which then became Caesars, the casino company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
You also talk about this. Yeah, there's this quote I have. "Acknowledge that others are often no better than you, because that makes you feel better about the story." So for people that actually want to be liked, I like being liked. I don't know if it's a flaw in my upbringing. Is the lesson you're capped on your power if you worry about if you want to be liked?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:24:05):
At the end of the day, you don't want to be intentionally disliked. You don't want to violate my dear friend Bob Sutton's book The No Asshole Rule and gratuitously be an asshole. But you are hired to get a job done. It's interesting. I unfortunately am now too old. In the words of my chiropractor, I'm suffering from too many birthdays. So I have a lot of doctors who are doing a great job. Trust me, when I choose a doctor, I have a, unfortunately he retired, a neurosurgeon who did two surgeries on my spine. He's considered to be one of the top 20 in the country. If you go on Yelp, you read about his personality and his office furniture. As I said to somebody, he's doing microsurgery on my spine, I can wind up permanently paralyzed. I really don't care about his personality. I don't care about his office furniture.

(00:25:01):
That's an extreme example, but it makes the point. When you are put in a role, you are put in a role because presumably you are supposed to perform in that role. If you get appointed to be a head coach, if we make you a quarterback on an NFL team, or we make you center on a National Basketball Association team, you did not get that job because people thought you had a cute personality. You got that job because you have the skills to make your organization successful. And if you do not use those skills because you're worried about what everybody else is thinking, you are not only harming yourself, but you're harming them because you are not doing what you were hired to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:46):
So a simple way of thinking about this, which makes me feel better about. As we talk through this, I'm becoming less uncomfortable with these, which is a good sign. It's don't actively try to be disliked. Don't prioritize being liked, prioritize competence and respect.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:25:59):
Correct, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
And doing the thing that needs to be done.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:03):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:04):
Okay, great. Let's talk about rule number two, which is break the rules. So basically again, these powers are ways to grow power, and you're saying that if you break the rules, you get more power. Talk about why that's the case, what that looks like.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:18):
Well, for many reasons, number one, when you break the rules, you stand out. You become memorable when you do something that's unexpected. And being memorable is of course important, as we've already discussed. That's number one. Number two, the rules were made mostly by the people who are favored by the rules in place. So if we were talking about business strategy, we would talk about a word that is probably now overused. We would talk about being a disruptor. That you would disrupt an industry. And how do you disrupt an industry? By doing something that is different from the other industry incumbents. In Southwest Airlines, you don't do hub and spoke. At Amazon, you provide an incredible level of customer service. Whole Foods, you don't optimize on the cost of the stuff in your store, but you optimize on fitting local taste, whatever. You would be a disruptor, you would do things that are different.

(00:27:14):
The same principle holds for you, that if you are going to be successful, you have to do what number one, plays to your strengths, to use the title of a Gallup book. Number two, you have to do things again that cause you to stand out, and you have to do things that basically will make you more successful. One of the conventional wisdoms that people I think adhere to way too much, is don't ask. Don't ask, don't ask for help. You need to show self-sufficiency. So my colleague, Frances Flynn, Frank Flynn, wrote an article with Vanessa Lake entitled, If You Need Help, Just Ask. And it turns out people overestimate how many people they're going to have to ask to get help, and it turns out that asking for help makes people uncomfortable.

(00:28:03):
I was married, if you read the acknowledgments in Seven Rules of Power. For more than 35 years I was married to Kathleen Francis Fowler, who I could send you a picture. She looked literally like a supermodel and I never have been any particularly better looking than I am now. So somebody said to me, how'd you get her to go out with you? And the answer of course is, I asked. I asked, I asked, I asked. No one, well, maybe not no one. But few people are going to go out with you if you don't ask them out. Few people are going to marry you if you don't ask them to marry. Few people are going to do anything if you don't ask. And what is the worst that could happen? If you ask and they say, no, you are no worse off than had you not asked in the first place. If you don't ask, you're not going to get it. If you ask and they say, no, you're not going to get it. Get over your ego, ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:59):
Is there another example that comes to mind of someone breaking the rules say in business, that ended up being really successful as a result, or just someone that is really good at this in business?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:07):
I can give you many examples. One of my favorite examples would be Jason Calacanis. I don't know if you know Jason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Oh yeah, I know you did a case study on him. I know him well. Yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:18):
So I think Jason, I think consistently breaks all kinds of rules. First of all, when he comes to my class, nobody likes him, but that's okay. Almost nobody likes him. But...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
That's power number one. He's not worried about.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:33):
Yeah, that's number one. But also I think there's a conventional wisdom in the venture capital industry which he defies almost completely. He makes a lot of little bets, not a few big bets. He runs a very lean operation. He doesn't have a lot of partners. He doesn't have actually any partners, so he can't be fired by his partners. He began his career in journalism, which is interesting. Being a journalist is a wonderful job because you get to ask people all kinds of questions. And if you ask smart people questions, and you have some reasonable level of intelligence yourself, at the end of that process, you're going to wind up incredibly smart and incredibly insightful. And he wound up incredibly smart and insightful around aspects of the internet industry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:23):
And he definitely has a lot of power. I think I am going to link to the case study in our show notes where you basically walk through how he went from nothing to a very powerful person.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:31):
And by the way, a very rich person as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:34):
Let's talk about another power, power five, networking relentlessly. What does that look like and how do you get better at this?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:42):
Well, I think there's research that shows that many people find networking dirty, and that's because I think they think about it in the wrong way. My friend John Levy, who has written a fabulous book, You're Invited. Which is a book about how to put on events that people want to come to. Is a fabulous human being. Will tell you that the first principle of networking is in fact generosity. It's generosity. What can I do for you? How can I be helpful? Who can I introduce you to? Either a company or a product or a person who can be helpful to you in your career.

(00:31:20):
But in order to be able to introduce you to someone who's going to be useful to you, I have to know people. If I don't know anybody, I can't introduce you to anybody. And the more people I know, the more likely it will be that if you say, I need to know somebody in X, I will know that person. So the broader your social network, the more people and the more things you will know. If knowledge is power, networking is a fabulous way to get knowledge about people and about ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
It's funny to hear this where it's like, yes, obviously this is right, but connecting it to if you want to become more powerful, more successful, you need to do this. I think that is a powerful point that we're all making here, is just like this actually is necessary if you want to acquire more power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:32:10):
Of course. I have a funny story about networking. So we have a thing in Stanford called View From The Top, in which these fancy people come in and give a talk. And one of the people came in and give a talk and made my class instantly popular, because he's an extraordinarily wealthy person. His name is Omid Kordestani, and so I reached out to him and I said, "Omid, let's have breakfast." So I can understand because during the thing, when somebody asked them what class was the most important in his success, he said mine. So I said, "Tell me your story." He said, "Well, I graduated from Stanford. I'm Persian in background, immigrant background. An engineer, HP, all the things that would make you kind of a nerd or something." He said, "I went to work for a couple of startups that didn't do well. Then I found myself in the mid-nineties at Netscape." The browser company, big deal. Anyway, Marc Andreessen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):
Oh yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:33:08):
Okay. "So I found myself in Netscape in marketing and business development. I was not making any progress. One day I decided to take your class to an extreme. I decided to stop doing my job." So I said, "When people gave you projects to do or assignments or tasks and you didn't do them?" He said, "It turns out that I spent my time, not obviously at the bar, but in networking first with people inside of Netscape. And it turns out if you're well-connected to the senior leaders, they don't really care if you do your job or not. That's number one. Number two," he said, "oftentimes I can find other people to do the work I was doing. So instead of basically spending time doing my job, I networked first within Netscape." But Netscape was not that big of a company. So after a while he decided to go through, which is by the way, his job anyway, in marketing and business, he decided to basically drive through the Silicon Valley talking to people. And this is the rest of the browsers are just beginning.

(00:34:14):
Nobody knows what a browser is, nobody knows what the internet is going to become. So he's having all these fabulous conversations. All right, so he now knows basically everybody. It's 1998 and a little tiny company decides 10 engineers, typical Silicon Valley company. 10 engineers, all engineers. I have a friend who went to work for a company, run a company that had 26 people. He didn't have one sales and marketing person. Anyway, the company now has 10 engineers. They decide they need to hire their first business person. Being an analytically oriented company, they say, we're going to do this very analytically. We are basically going to ask everybody we can think of, and a few people we can't. Give us a list of the best technically oriented business people that you know. And there is of course one name that appears on every list. It is Omid Kordestani who becomes employee number 11 at Google and makes two and a half billion dollars.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):
Great success from networking. Well done. When people hear about networking, it just feels like you said, very cringe. I don't want to go to these networking events and try to pretend to talk and care about people. Do you have any advice for just how to make networking feel less cringy?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:35:28):
One of the exercises I give my students is I say, write a list of 10 people who, if you knew them and if they knew you, would be important for whatever you're trying to accomplish in your career. So maybe you're trying to get into biotech, you need to know 10 executives in biotech or whatever. Make a list of 10 people. Then for each person figure out how you are going to meet them. By the way, not necessarily in a network event. Maybe you want to do what John Levy does, which is hold dinners. In which by the way, the guests do the cooking, which is a very interesting idea. That of course taps into the IKEA effect. You always like something better if you participate in creating it. Maybe you want to hold dinners, maybe you want to try to reach out to them at lunch.

(00:36:21):
Maybe you want to reach out to them and say, here's an article I think you'd be interested in. Here is somebody who I think you'd benefit from meeting. So recently, I'm not a particularly good networker, though I'm better I guess than some people. I recently met Esther Wojcicki, I'm sure I killed her name. She's considered the grandmother of Silicon Valley. She's Susan Wojcicki's mother. And she is interested in depression, particularly depression among teenagers. And I said, you should know Leanne Williams, who's in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Science Department, who has done probably 300 articles on depression and has invented something which is called Precision Psychiatry. So I connected them to each other. Just send an email. I think you ought to know each other. They got together. I get credit for knowing people and connecting them, but I also benefit them. Leanne needs to raise money. Esther's got money. Esther needs to understand the cutting edge research in depression and biomarkers of depression, which is what Leanne's specialty is, so they benefit. So this is not some icky thing. This is connecting people who benefit from being connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
That touches on something you teach in the book is, in your networking you want to become a broker, you want to be central. That's kind of what you want to work on. Can you talk a bit about what that means?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:37:47):
Well, that means you want to connect people. So many people with benefits, and many groups with benefits for being connected, and they're not connected. What does a venture capitalist do? Connects people with ideas to people with money, and takes a fee for doing it. What does an investment banker do? Connects people trying to sell businesses or raise capital with people trying to buy businesses or who have capital. What's a real estate agent do? Connects buyers and sellers of houses. There are all kinds of examples where the person's entire job is connecting people. But even for the people whose job it isn't, you benefit from knowing people. The more people you know, the more things you know. As I sometimes say in my class, if leadership management, call it what you will, is getting things done through other people, it seems like common sense that the more other people you know, the more you'll be able to get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):
As someone that has become central to a lot of things in the product world, and has built a large network as a result of this podcast newsletter, I can tell you a thousand percent. This creates a lot of opportunity and power, you could say in quotes. So I've seen it happen.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:39:00):
Of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):

(00:40:10):
Another lesson I guess you teach is to pursue weak ties. Talk a bit about what that means. What do you mean by that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:40:14):
Well, the people to whom you are strongly tied, your family, your spouse, significant other, your friends, the people who work with you at work will probably, because they are close to you, know the same things and the same people that you do. So to the extent that you build ties with people who are more different from you in every dimension, you are more likely to learn non-redundant information, and come in contact with people that you don't already know. This again seems common sense. There's a lot of research behind it. Mark Granovetter, a sociologist who still teaches at Stanford, wrote a book entitled The Strength of Weak Ties.

(00:40:59):
And basically, no, actually, pardon me. He wrote an article called The Strength of Weak Ties. His book was called Getting a Job. And he did a study, I guess it was at that time in Boston. He did a study of job seekers in Massachusetts, and he looked at people who got jobs through applying to ads, through more formal means. And then he looked at people who got jobs through referrals from their network. And it turns out, of course, the jobs that you get through your network referrals are much better jobs. And oftentimes the best jobs that people got were referred to them by people that were not particularly close to them. Because they had a view, that's the word I was looking for, a view into the ecosystem of the Boston labor market, that the other people didn't have because they weren't in the same place as the other people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
I love that lesson. Let's talk about another power, which is using your power. So when people think of using your power builds more power, that's not intuitive. You talk about how it creates this self-perpetuating growth of power the more you practice power. Can you talk a bit about that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:42:16):
Sure. So when you are given, it's interesting, my friend Deborah Gruenfeld, who wrote a book called Acting with Power, talks a lot about people's ambivalence to power. So sometimes people are put in a job. Herminia Ibarra who teaches now at London Business School, at one point taught in Seattle, at one point taught at Harvard, has an article in the Harvard Business Review in which she talks about a woman in a drug company who gets a promotion, and says to her colleagues, to whom she's now overseeing, that she's not sure why she got the job. She's not sure she deserves the job. Needless to say, she didn't do very well in this job because she got in her own way. But part of this is you are put in a position of power. You're put in a position of authority in order to make things happen. So to the extent you mobilize your resources and get things to happen, you'll get more resources.

(00:43:14):
People want to be associated with success. To the extent that you become successful, more people will want to work with you. To the extent that you get more stuff done, you'll get more promotions, more opportunities. Nobody's going to give you a job to do if the last five jobs like that they gave you, you couldn't get done. So the more you are able to do, which oftentimes of course requires power and influence, the more you're able to do, the more you'll be asked to do. But better yet, the more resources you'll be given to help you get things done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:48):
And I think there's interestingly you teach that just showing that you have power creates more power. People see that you have this power and they start to follow your lead more, right? That's a part of this.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:43:57):
Yep. I just saw over the weekend the movie, the latest movie in the franchise of the Planet of the Apes. When Jim Collins left Stanford, he gave me a book called Chimpanzee Politics, which is of course not based on the Planet of the Apes, but it's based upon the study of chimpanzees. We are the same. People are attracted to power, you know that. By the way, that will account for a lot of what is going to happen in the presidential election.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):
Let's save that for the end, because I think that's an interesting piece of your book, of the connection to Trump. So let's save that for a bit. I think that'll be really interesting. Kind of along the same lines of the area we're just talking about. And another rule of power is to show up in a powerful fashion. So look powerful, talk about what that looks like.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:44:43):
So my colleague at Berkeley, Dana Carney, C-A-R-N-E-Y, is writing a book called Tell, which is about the importance of body language and how to master body language. There is some evidence that suggests we respond mostly to how people look, secondarily to how they sound, and by far the least important to the content of what they say. You can see this by turning on your TV and turning off the sound. Watch the presidential debates with the sound off. They'll be much better. I have another colleague in marketing by the name of Baba Shiv, who talks about people's freaky mind, or the idea that we are in fact descended from primates, and that we are controlled in lots of ways by our emotions. And so we respond affectively to other people. We respond to how they look. There's evidence in economics that suggests tall people earn more salaries, control, earn more money, controlling for lots of things, attractive people.

(00:45:46):
As long as you're not too attractive, you earn more money. Optimal level of attractiveness because people respond subconsciously to how people look, how they sound, how they show up, how they present themselves. In my class, I take the example of Tony Hayward of BP, the Macondo oil spill, and Lloyd Blankfein who was accused of shorting the securities that he was selling, which by the way, Goldman did. And before I let them hear Tony or Lloyd, we show about 60 seconds. And Lloyd's case 34 seconds with no sound. And even if you did not know who these people were and I asked you to make a bet, who's going to keep their job and who's going to lose it? You would know just from their physical appearance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):
I love that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:46:39):
And by the way, what Dana Carney will tell you, and what common sense will tell you, is that these are skills that can be mastered. Robert de Niro was not born Robert de Niro, in the sense of acting skills are learned. How you show up, how you command the room. There's a guy named Regis McKenna who is older than God, who's famous for running a very, very, very fancy public relations firm in the Silicon Valley. And his biggest contribution to life, as well as by the way to his personal wealth, is that he made Steve Jobs Steve Jobs. When Steve Jobs began, Steve Jobs couldn't convince you to buy water if you were dying of thirst. He could not give a presentation to save his life. And Regis McKenna and his team took Steve Jobs under their wing and created Steve Jobs, a man who could sell anything to anybody. These are skills. This is not about personality. This is not about undergoing some kind of cosmetic surgery or whatever. These are skills, everything we've talked about, networking, showing up, all these things. These are skills that can be learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:55):
I have a list of some of the stuff you actually recommend for looking and appearing powerful. So I'll read a few and I'm curious what else comes to mind. So do not read from notes. Make eye contact. Keep it brief. You say that anger can be a signal of power because it's outside the norm. It's kind of breaking the rules. Don't apologize. It's kind of the opposite. More gestures, which is interesting. Open body posture. Louder voice. Okay, I'm going to speak louder now. I like this. Okay, what else comes to mind as ways to appear powerful?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:48:26):
Invading people's personal space. So gentle touching, standing close to someone. We're not talking about sexual touching, we're talking touch on the arm or the shoulder, shaking people's hands. That's a way of I think being more powerful. But you've covered the main ones. Eye contact. One of the problems with Tony Hayward of BP is that he's been given a statement to read. You cannot read something in front of you and make eye contact at the same time. So he looks like he's scripted. He looks like he's insincere. Jack Valenti, who I had the privilege of knowing, who for 38 years was the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and typically rated one of the number one or number two most effective lobbyists in Washington DC, said to my class when he came to my class, which he did, "I never appeared before Congress with notes. I wanted them to believe, which was by the way, true, that I was in complete control and complete mastery of the material, and that I did not need notes or a bunch of assistants around me to help me.

(00:49:40):
That I, as the head of the MPAA, understood the motion picture industry." And then he would give you a little aside about how it was the one industry that consistently had a budget surplus in trade. He would talk about how many jobs he created and he had all this stuff at his fingertips. But basically his command of the material made him more powerful. It's interesting, Jack Valenti was five foot two inches tall and he came, talked to my class, and the next class I said to people, "What are your reactions? What are your thoughts?" And a woman raised her hand and said, "He feels taller than he is." And I thought that was an assessment that was both true and insightful. When the five-foot-two Jack Valenti appeared, because of his presence, because of his body language, because of his Texas drawl, because of how he moved on the stage, he felt bigger. You would not say he did not feel five-foot-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):
Let me read a couple more because this is a good example of stuff he did. Other ways to appear more powerful is more speaking time, longer gazing time, more disinhibited laughs. Is that just you laughing and feeling like you're just...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:08):
Well, humor. Humor. The famous author, Salman Rushdie said, and I quote Salman Rushdie, it's a fabulous quote. "If you can get people to laugh, you can tell them anything."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
Yeah, stand-up comedy is a great example that. So again, I think here people might be hearing this and they're like, I don't want to be this person. I don't want to be talking all the time. I don't want to be pretending like open posture. Is the advice here just you don't need to do all these things. Just know this makes people more powerful. Don't necessarily judge people, do some of these things maybe because it'll add to your power? How do you think about just people that are turned off by this sort of thing?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:45):
That's a wonderful question. So I say to my class, on the very first day of class, that we will go through four stages. We'll go through the stage of denial. It doesn't work in my culture, it doesn't work in my organization, doesn't work for me, it doesn't work in my religion, whatever. Then we'll go through anger. When they get angry at me, how can you teach us this stuff? Then they'll go into sadness. I actually believe this and I'm depressed. And if we're successful, they will go through acceptance. And the process I have, again, I do not have the most popular class at Stanford Business School because I am good-looking, because I'm the smartest person at Stanford or anything else. I am strategic about thinking about if I have someone who's going to come into this class, I have to get them from denial to acceptance in 10 weeks.

(00:52:38):
And how are we going to do that? The easiest way to do that, if I said, Lenny, I want you to become a better tennis player, or a better roller blader, or a better ice skater, whatever, a better piano player in 10 weeks, what would we do? If we have practice and coaching. And that's what I do in the class, practice and coaching. I have executive coaches who work with the class and I give them assignments that ask them to practice what they're learning. And therefore, by the end of the class, most people have made this transition because it is true. If you've never... I had a dinner the other night, this Israeli woman who's like, I've done amazing stuff. Amazing. Which is fabulous. And she said at the dinner, she said, "I would've never done this before taking your class." And the way you get them to do this is I don't say, Lenny, you're going to swim the English Channel tomorrow.

(00:53:38):
If I want you to swim the English Channel, we're going to start by swimming in pools and make every day a little bit more challenging. That's what we do. I don't start by saying, you're going to network like Keith Ferrazzi or John Levy, or you're not going to be as bold as Jason Calacanis, who trust me is extraordinarily bold. You're not going to necessarily do what I did. You're going to begin where you can begin, and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Because, and again, this is common sense.

(00:54:13):
There's also a ton of research behind it. If you always stay in your comfort zone, you'll never do anything different or better than what you're currently doing. This is true. If I said to you, I want you to, at the end of 10 weeks, lift a hundred pounds, I can't do that by on the last day saying lift a hundred pounds. We have to work up to it. And that is, it's the same principle here. So don't do something that looks so off the wall or so out of character for you that you can't conceive doing it. Push yourself a little, push yourself a little.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):
There's an interesting connection here too. What some say is kind of the opposite of your class at Stanford, which is Touchy-Feely. We had Carole Robin on the podcast and she has a framework, the 15% rule where you push yourself 15% beyond your comfort zone. Where it's just a little bit, but it's not too far, and it feels like you try to do a similar thing.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:07):
Yeah, absolutely. So you begin by doing what you don't think you can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Let's spend a little more time here around the homework assignments, and this kind of Knowing-Doing Gap that you talked about. So you shared a couple of homework assignments you give already, find 10 people, think of 10 people you want to meet that'll help you with your career and then try to meet them. And then there's this, I guess my friend started a podcast, I don't know which homework it was. What other homework assignments do you give?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:30):
So we begin, there's a literature on goal setting that says if you set goals, you're more likely to achieve them. This is, again, not some huge insight, but there's an enormous scientific literature about this. And so I begin the very first homework assignment is, which is by the way, on the very first day of class, why are you here? Why are you here? It is now the end of this class. What would success look like to you? What would you like to accomplish in our 10 weeks together? Second assignment, I give them a reading from the Power book, which is the book before Seven Rules, which talks about the seven attributes of power. Go out and get people to rate you on these or rate yourself. Set for yourself a development plan, energy, focus, being willing to tolerate conflict, all these qualities. What are you strong on? What are you weak on? What do you want to build during our time together, and how are you going to do it?

(00:56:35):
So we begin with goal setting. One of the assignments I give them, which is the class that Jason comes to, what resources can you create? You're at Stanford Business School, elite, fancy Stanford. What can you do in your 10 weeks here? I have people who created awards. A woman who created an award gave it to Karlie Kloss, the model. Got in trouble with the school. It turns out it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. So what can you do to create resources that will give you some leverage? That would be a third assignment. The networking is a fourth assignment. The acting with power. I show them the videos and I tell them in advance of the class, and I tell them they need to become Tony Hayward. They need to do a better job, which is, by the way, a low bar, representing BP. And give me a 60 to 90 second video and then share it with colleagues and get feedback on it. And then we're going to call on people in the class.

(00:57:47):
In other words, for every idea, I try to think of something. And this is all, by the way, this is all front-loaded. And by the end of the class we're not doing this so much. But I try to give them an exercise that causes them to actually take that idea and implement it. Find people, oh, for branding. Write a personal brand statement, get some feedback on it, then write it again. How do you want to be known? Which is by the way, useful to you because you're a second-year MBA, you're going to go in the job market. What do you want people to think about you? How do you want people to respond to you? How do you want to be known? So I basically take for every topic and have them do it. And then the coach, their person, their coach, who is responsible for 23 of these people, give them feedback on this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:44):
I could see how this makes a big impact on someone's life.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:58:49):
Yeah. And so at the end, I had a student a couple years ago said to me, "It is not that I got more feedback and more useful feedback from your class than I did in any other class. I got more useful feedback in your class than I did on every other class I took combined."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:09):
I can see why. Let's talk about the last power. So we've talked through six already. We have only one more to go, which is maybe the one that probably upsets people most, which is that once you have power, people will forget what you did to get there. Talk about what that looks like and is that a power or is it more just like this is what you should know about.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:59:28):
And I put in rule seven for the following reason. In spite of everything that you and I have been talking about, many people in a stage of, I don't know, denial or something, say, I'm worried that if I do this, at the end... People believe that the world is homeostatic. It is not. That it's going to adjust, but whatever. At the end I will be brought low. They have the myth of Icarus in their head. You fly too close to the sun, your wings are going to melt, you're going to be brought down. And so I try to convince them, partly through a lecture and partly through rule seven. And some of the principles that I talk about in rule seven. That, in fact, life is not homeostatic at all. That life is actually self-fulfilling. If I believe you're powerful, you will become more powerful.

(01:00:26):
If I believe you have no power, you will wind up with almost no power, and that therefore it is all forgotten and forgiven. And I begin, I believe I begin. But if not, I could begin with the story of the South Carolina Senator who says nasty things about Trump, and then Lindsey Graham, and becomes Trump's biggest acolyte. And the New York Times, of course, is fascinated by this. How can you say all these horrible things about Trump and now be his, basically have your lips affixed to some part of his anatomy? And Lindsey's answer is, I want to be relevant. He's the President of the United States. This goes back to the judgment. I like him, this, that, the other thing. He's the president. If I want to get legislation passed, he, by the way, has taken over the Republican Party.

(01:01:22):
If I want to get stuff done, I need to have him on my side. And like many narcissists and egomaniacs, it is not a good way to get them on your side by saying nasty things about them. So this is the pragmatics. People forget that Bill Gates stole the code on which Microsoft has built. People forget that Jeffrey Epstein, after being convicted of sex offenses, was still having dinners with members of the royal family and members of the New York media elite. People forget that Martha Stewart, who served time in jail, has a brand that's never been more valuable. People forget all this stuff.

(01:02:19):
I still remember sitting in the office of someone whose name I won't use, but I'll use enough that if somebody wanted to search it out, you could. So I am sitting in this guy's office and he's, by the way, a Jewish man. He's got pictures of him with the Pope, he's got pictures of him with Ronald Reagan. He's got pictures with him, with all these people. What is his secret? He, by the way, took a company into bankruptcy. People lost literally billions of dollars. He was fined. He lost money, but he walked away with about $700 million. It turns out, $700 million makes you a big deal. Lives at the biggest house in Los Angeles or one of the biggest houses in Los Angeles. I can't keep up with the construction of the big houses. People want to be close to money, power, and success, and they will overlook your flaws to be close to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):
And again, you talk about this in the book. You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is, and this is how you can be successful in the world that we live in.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:03:28):
And by the way, this is how the world not only is, but how it was and how it will be. Because these ideas are not something that I sat down one day and made up or something. These ideas, everything that I talk about, including this last one, has social science and logic behind it. So you can explain not only what is, but why it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
So, let's talk about Trump for a bit. At the beginning of your book, you say that basically you were going to write a book about why Trump is so successful and what he's done so well. And your realization is no one's going to pay attention if here's how to be like Trump. And essentially, if you think about all these rules, it's clear he is very good at all of these things.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:16):
That's correct. By the way, not because he read the book, but because he does it through trial and error or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
So when people hear that, they're like, I don't want to be Trump. I don't like how Trump is. I don't want to be seen that way. Do you have any thoughts on just how to make people feel comfortable following some of these powers and building power, knowing that, oh wow, maybe he's the epitome of some of this stuff?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:38):
I will tell you a story. In 1993, a woman named Laura Esserman, who's a doctor, took my class. She claims publicly that this is the only class at Stanford for which she did all the reading. By the way, while she was getting her MBA at Stanford, she was having her first child and practicing medicine full time. Laura Esserman said to me one day, "You have a case. You have cases on all these people doing evil things. Why don't you ever write a case about somebody doing good things?" And of course, I wrote a case about her. So she comes to the class. Case was published in probably 2003, 2004.

(01:05:31):
She comes to the class and the students are, what is the right word? Hard on her? That would be a modest thing. The students eviscerate her because she is incredibly smart, incredibly well-intentioned, but she will not network. She says, "I don't have time for schmoozing." She will not do almost any of the stuff that we talk about today. So she and her husband, Michael Endicott, two of my closest friends in the world, and I go out to lunch afterwards. And smoke is coming out of her ears and she is pissed off. And this is a very accomplished woman and a very smart woman. And she's pissed. I said to her, "Laura, you have boundless energy and boundless intelligence. You're a force of nature. Let me discuss something from the past subject of physics.

(01:06:39):
You are creating friction. With enough force you can overcome the friction. If you reduce the friction, just think how much more you could accomplish." And she looked at me and changed. And I will tell you, and I've said this publicly, because I get to introduce her for all the awards she's won, and she's now won a ton of them. Including Time Magazine 2016 list of a hundred most influential people in the world. And I say to people, and I say it with pride, that of all the things I've done in my life, the thing I'm most proud of and most proud of is creating Laura Esserman.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:20):
That is an awesome story and a really good way of thinking about this from a different angle.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:07:24):
Yeah, no, and I said to Laura, I said, "You want to make profound changes in the drug development process. You want to make profound changes in whether or not we learn from the treatments that are being given to people. You want to make profound changes in the connection between research and teaching, research and practice. You want to do all these things. If you are going to accomplish any of these things, you need to cross the bridge." And she hasn't crossed the bridge completely and she and I joke about it. But she crossed the bridge a lot and she has accomplished incredible things. She's won every cancer award that can be given. And by the way, she's won all these awards for the American Cancer Society, who she fought with. She's won these awards from the Susan Cohen Foundation, who she fought with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:20):
This is an incredible example of the opening quote to your book that I have here. "If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power."

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:28):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):
And I like the, it's like a quote attributed to me, is how you...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:34):
Yeah. Well, I don't remember saying it, but somebody said, I said it. I'll take credit for it. I said to Laura, "You want to change medicine? Medicine is not going to change without the application of power and influence." If change was going to happen, it would've happened already. You have to take on entrenched interests. She has a whole thing, which we need not go into because it's pretty technical, on screening. She said, everybody's getting a mammogram every year beyond a certain age, which is stupid for a variety of reasons. You can read, she was on the PBS NewsHour about this. This is what got her in trouble with the radiologists. The radiologists, of course, are selling screening. She said, there's some people that need to be screened every month, and there's some people that need to be screened never because of their genetics. She wants custom tailored screening or precision screening. Anyway, she fights everybody.

(01:09:29):
Richard Blum, Dianne Feinstein's husband, both Dianne and Richard Blum are now deceased, was at a thing where she launched the Athena Project. The Athena Project, she's now, with her collaborators, collecting data on the diagnosis and treatment and outcome for 150,000 patients in the University of California Healthcare System. So I'm supposed to give some opening talk to provide entertainment. And Dick Blum is there. Dick Blum, of course is wealthy. He's Dianne Feinstein's husband. I said to him, "Dick, how did Laura get you here?" And I still remember, I think this is a quote in one of the books I wrote. He said to me, he said, "Look." He said, "I've learned that at the end of the day when Laura asks you to do something, you may say no, but at the end of the day, you're going to do it anyway. Save yourself the aggravation."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):
Oh man, I feel like you're just endlessly full of good stories that we could just keep going on and on. Let me try to summarize the rules of power real quick and see if anything else emerges. And then have just a couple more questions. So the Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, that what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both. Let me ask you a question, maybe half in jest. You teach people how to acquire power. Why aren't you the most powerful man in the world?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:10:57):
Ah, that's a very good question. To which I have a very good answer. I have a colleague who's unfortunately now deceased, by the name of James G. March, who was a very, very distinguished scholar. And James March said to me many, many years ago, something which is completely true. You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both. And I have chosen to live a life of freedom, autonomy. I could tell you stories that would bring tears to your eyes. I'll tell you one. We had a dean of the Business School whose wife was dying of cancer, and she was projected to die in the fall. So the Business School goes to him and says, we'll give you the fall off to be with your wife. She lives until June. It's now winter.

(01:11:46):
You have responsibilities as the Dean of the Business School. You have to meet with alumni. You have to go around and raise money. You have to show up at events, university events. I do not necessarily think that is how he wanted to spend the winter and spring quarters, but that's what you have to do. When I wanted Jack Valenti to come to my class, I did not call Jack Valenti. I called Judy Dickey. Judy Dickey was his assistant. Judy Dickey controlled his schedule. I meet Jack on such and such a day. He can't make it on that day. Fine. I can adjust the schedule. Can he make it on this day?

(01:12:24):
When I wanted my friend Gary Loveman, who ran Harrah's and Caesars and then was the number two executive at Aetna, I want him to come to my class. I called Reggie Kirk. I didn't call Gary Loveman. And that's all you need to know. I do not have an assistant who controls my schedule. I control my schedule. You will not find my Outlook calendar on any website, on any computer. I want autonomy. If I said to you, "Lenny, I will give you $1 billion, or for that matter, $10 billion if you can buy-"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):
Yes.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:13:02):
Wait, if you can have last week again. You can't. You can't. Time goes in only one direction. I want control of my time. It is much more important to me, being a Dean or an Associate Dean, a job that I was asked to do. I took one academic administrative job. I'm actually memorialized, believe it or not, in the Stanford Record, as having led, and this is according to my expenses, the Nobel Prize winner who was Dean at the time, that I led the biggest and most successful transformation in the history of higher education. I did it. I did it once. I didn't like it. Life is too short. I want to do what I like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:52):
That's a really profound point that I think people don't think about, is there's always this drive to acquire power. And your point is that there's a big downside, which is a lack of autonomy. Yeah. You think about the, as I was trying to get Satya Nadella on the podcast, and I talked to his comms people, and they're like, every hour for the next three months is booked already. We know what he's doing. He's extremely booked. And you think about the president, obviously at Elon. I totally get what you're saying.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:14:17):
It is true, and I don't want to do that. And by the way, power also comes with enormous visibility. Donald Trump has done, for 40 years, what he's now being accused of doing, the tax stuff, all this stuff. He's been a grifter all his life. But when you become President, people are going to look at things that in the past they would not have looked at. You become president of a university, you're going to have scrutiny as the President of Harvard Law and the President of Stanford Law, when they both had to resign, in one case because of plagiarism, in another case because of research misconduct.

(01:14:55):
Power comes. You're going to be put under a microscope. People are going to look at what car you drive. They're going to look at who you go out with. They're going to look at how you spend your time. They're going to look at how you associate with, you'll have no privacy. You'll have very little control over your life. Everybody will feel completely free to dissect you in public, in private, whatever. And you'll face the trust dilemma. When you are rich and powerful the question will be, are people praising you, are people associating with you because of you or because of the position you hold?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:41):
Yeah. Do you spend any time, just to follow this thread in your class, convincing people stop being so obsessed with power, stop being so obsessed with becoming the top of everything? Is that a part of the class?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:52):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:52):
Or is it just...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:53):
No. I teach them, they see we have a class on the price of power. I bring out Rudy Crew. Rudy Crew was the New York School's Chancellor under Rudy Giuliani. By the way, he tells many interesting stories about Rudy Giuliani, who did not just become the joke that he is overnight. He's worked hard to become that. But in any event, he tells. And one year, one year, because his daughter at that time was living in the Bay Area, when I asked him about the effect of the positions he held, Head of Miami Dade County Schools, Head of New York City schools.

(01:16:29):
Had Hillary ever won, he would've been Secretary of Education. Literally. There's Lauren in the room. And he said to the class, Jeffrey asked me the question, "Why don't we let Lauren answer it?" By the time she was finished, there was not a dry eye in the room. What is it like to be the child? What is it like to be the significant other of these people? And you know the answer to that because you can see the suicides, the divorce rates. There is a price that not only you pay, but a price that your family pays.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):
I think that's a really good balance to the entire conversation. Maybe just as a last question, what if we give the audience a homework assignment to work on these power rules? What's something that you'd recommend someone try to do? I know it's probably dependent on what they're good at, not good at. What's something that they could do to start moving towards one of these rules?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:17:28):
So what I would say, and it comes from something that you talked about in our conversation at several times, which is this is uncomfortable. Okay. So if I want you to do something uncomfortable, I could say, "Lenny, go do this uncomfortable thing on your own." Or I can say, "Lenny, I want you to do this with help, with social support." And so the first thing I would say to someone is, if you think this is uncomfortable, or if you think you're not skilled at this, get coaching. Get a coach.

(01:18:03):
I send out regularly the list of the coaches who work with my online and on-campus classes. Happy to do it. And they're happy to have the business. Get a coach. Get a personal board of directors like they talk about in the Wall Street Journal. In other words, get people who will give you advice, give you social support, and hold you accountable. That's the very first thing I would tell people to do. It's hard to do anything on your own. If I said to you, "Lenny, I want you to start an extraordinarily successful podcast and I want you to do it without any help." You would not be where you are today. So that simple principle, get help.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):
It feels like a part of rule number one. Get out of your own way. Ask for help. Jeffrey, I was nervous for this podcast because I thought this was going to be super uncomfortable stuff. It turns out all of this makes so much sense, and there's a really nice way of framing all of these rules, and there's so much reason to actually invest in these skills. So I really appreciate you putting in the time being here, sharing all these stories and insights. Is there anything else you want to share as a kind of a final note or something to leave listeners with before we wrap up? We did it. We covered everything?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:19):
No, I'm happy. I'm happy you're a very good interviewer, which is why your podcast is so successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):
I appreciate that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:25):
I'm happy to spend the time with you, and I hope whoever listens to this will, I hope, first of all, there'll be a lot of listeners, but I also hope that they will find it useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):
I know they will. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they, or find your book, I guess, if they want to learn more? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:41):
So you can find my book anywhere where books are sold. Don't look at a physical bookstore because nobody carries it, including actually Stanford bookstore, where they run out of it if people... And you can find it on Amazon. Seven Rules of Power. So that's how you can find the book. By the way, at the end of the book I talk about, I have a personal website, jeffreypfeffer.com. If you go to that website, you can find my course outline. So you can take the course on your own if you want, or get somebody or take it in a group of people.

(01:20:13):
You can find research, you can find articles, you can find columns. You can follow me on LinkedIn or I don't do Twitter anymore, but you can follow me on LinkedIn. So there are a lot of resources available for this. A company was once thinking of hiring me to give a talk in their organization, and the woman who wound up hiring me said, "When I was discussing you and arguing that we should hire you for this presentation, one of the people in the committee said, is he a good presenter?" And her answer, I love this. I remember this. Her answer was, "He's a fabulous educator." My job is to educate. That is why I have done what I have done for now more than 50 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:03):
Holy moly. I didn't even realize that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:21:06):
For more than 50 years, I have been in the business of education. Not just about power, but about many other things as well. But I'm in the education business, so I'm happy to provide people with the resources, with the readings. The Seven Rules of Power is well footnoted. It talks at the end about we could reach out for the coaches. You can go to the website and get the book. But I think consistent with what you and I have talked about, if all you do is read, you're not going to make very much progress. You have to do it. You cannot learn tennis by reading about tennis, or by watching a movie about Serena or Venus Williams. You have to actually get out on the court and do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):
Which is a good plug for your other book, the Knowing-Doing Gap, which actually helps you with the skill, which you can also find all your finer retailers. Jeffrey Pfeffer, thank you so much for being here.

# $1M to $10M: The enterprise sales playbook with Jen Abel

## Transcript

Jen Abel (00:00:00):
You need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
Most founders would rather get 10, 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal.

Jen Abel (00:00:17):
In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you. If they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
It might be giving you a false sense of success and product market fit.

Jen Abel (00:00:34):
As soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation. Here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Something else that you talk about is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:00:52):
It's more of an art. It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone. If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, "It's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible?" And she's like, "It's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it." These are how enterprise deals gets done. It's relationships.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
What's kind of like the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (00:01:18):
I don't use a tool. The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick or treating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Jen Abel, co-founder of JJELLYFISH where she and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell and now GM of Enterprise at State Affairs. If you want to become better at selling your product, this episode is going to blow your mind and make you so much better in every way. This is the second time Jen's been on the podcast. Our first conversation was focused around getting from zero to 1 million ARR, essentially founder led sales.

(00:01:59):
This conversation is part two going from around one million in ARR to around 10 million. This is the most tactical and in the weeds discussion you will find anywhere for free on how to actually become more effective at selling to enterprises.

Jen Abel (00:04:45):
Lenny, it's starting to feel familiar and I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast. So I actually shared on Twitter that you're coming back and I had so many people ask so many questions. Clearly, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of need for learning how to get better at the stuff, we're going to talk about sales, enterprise sales to frame the discussion, our first chat, which we're going to point people to if they want to start there, we focused on founder-led sales, which is essentially the beginning phases of a startup, kind of going from zero to about 100 million ARR.

(00:05:17):
This discussion is on the next phase, which is going from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR in enterprise sales, not like PLG or anything like that. You have a bunch of really strong and counter intuitive opinions and piece of advice on how to be successful at this. So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these things. We'll see where it goes. Before we get into the first one, is there anything broadly, I don't know, is there anything broadly you want to share? Anything you want to say before we dive in?

Jen Abel (00:05:41):
No, let's dive right in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:42):
Okay. Okay, so the first thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about before is this point that you often make that the mid-market does not exist. People often hear about enterprise companies. There's obviously SMBs and startups. There's also people just, "Oh, I'm going to go after the mid-market." Somewhere between. You don't think that's real? Talk about your experience there, what people should know.

Jen Abel (00:06:03):
It's fascinating because if you ask someone to describe the mid-market, actually, if you ask someone to describe the enterprise, every single person has a different answer. It's either based off of revenue, it's either based off of market cap, it's based off of employee size, and I think a lot of people can get lost because selling to a hundred person organization is a radically different game than selling to a thousand person organization and there's no hybrid approach.

(00:06:35):
So the best way to think about it is you have small business which typically can be really powered by marketing, and then you have enterprise, which is typically going to be sales led. If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing. Now, when we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, "Are we talking about the upper end of small business or are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?"

(00:07:04):
And most people are usually saying the lower end of enterprise. And I say, "Great, know you're playing the enterprise game. Know the type of people you need to hire, the type of ACV they need because it makes it a lot easier than trying to have this middle ground that catches everything that doesn't distinctly define SMB and enterprise." So I say the mid-market doesn't exist because what is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB, and if you bleed those two games you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different. So that's kind of my theory on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
You have this chart that you shared with me that will link people to where you kind of show the number of companies within each of these segments and there's basically nobody in this kind of middle segment, talk about that a bit.

Jen Abel (00:07:46):
That's right, and just like the power laws, if you look at the Fortune 1,000 and then the lower end enterprise from there, it trails off so fast. Power laws totally exist in these large corporations and we can't be treating everyone the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
This begs the question, where do you suggest companies start? There's obviously startups classically are just like innovators, move fast, can make quick decisions, enterprises have all the money. Usually the advice I hear is just don't go after the fancy companies to start because they take a long time. You don't want to screw it up. What's your advice on where to start for most companies?

Jen Abel (00:08:30):
The exact opposite. Early adopters are those logos because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the ... Staying in the number one spot is the hardest part. So those number one logos are like if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted, that's where I get the pat on the back because we are the world's leader in our industry and we cannot be disrupted there.

(00:09:05):
So there's this running joke where not a running joke, there's this running statement where a lot of VCs will say, "Don't go after tier one logos, go learn down market." Or, "o learn from logos that don't necessarily carry a lot of weight." The ones that carry all the weight are the ones that are willing to take a shot and want to help, right? Because they also want to be, they also want to be able to dictate the roadmap.

(00:09:30):
Now it's the founder's job to decide what can be done and what shouldn't be done, but their voice takes you a $100,000 deal into a million dollar deal in a very short period of time. It will literally guide you there. So when someone says, "Hey, go after startups, such as short sales cycle." Yeah, that makes sense. I totally get that. It's very easy to define the decision maker.

(00:09:54):
It's very easy, you don't have to go through procurement, but in the age of AI where it's all about sucking the oxygen out of the room and winning the deal and getting your foot in the door as quickly as humanly possible before someone else tries to take that, you want to get to the enterprise as fast as humanly possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Just so folks understand what we're talking about here, when you say tier one, what's a good way to think about what tier one is?

Jen Abel (00:10:16):
Tier one is like your Walmarts, your McDonald's, your NVIDIAs, your Tesla, your ExxonMobil, your UnitedHealthcare, the logos that are the leader in their space, their job is to stay in the number one spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:35):
Wow. Your advice is because this is very counterintuitive. This is exactly what you're here not to do. Your advice is go after the Chevrons and the Mobils and the Walmarts as a startup.

Jen Abel (00:10:46):
Because if you can get them, that's all the proof you need.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
How do you approach finding someone? Let's just get tactical there. Just like say you're going after Walmart. I know this is not a five-second answer, but just how would someone approach finding someone at Walmart to sell to?

Jen Abel (00:11:01):
First of all, make sure the founder is involved, right? Everyone loves talking to a founder, so we'll start with let's get the founder involved as fast as human possible. The second is you need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. There's a very big difference between problem selling and gap selling. Problem selling is highly specific, more technical than not, and it's the way that every salesperson is going to go about it, find the problem and anchor to it.

(00:11:33):
When you're selling to a leader, you need to be vision casting and you need to be selling an opportunity which is they are here, here's where we can take you. You know that image where it's like Mario or Mario, and then there's the mushroom and then there's Mario on blast, and everyone is like, "Don't sell the mushroom, sell Mario on blast." Well, that's exactly what it's saying.

(00:11:57):
It's about selling the opportunity. That's what gets the tier one logos excited and that is the best thing for a founder to sell, selling the vision versus the problem, and also it's what gets them to want to take a swing. Who wants to take a swing because you can do some small problem? They're not going to go to bath for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
What's an example of a vision cast in a company you've worked with just to make this real? What does it look like when you've done a great job?

Jen Abel (00:12:23):
We have an ability to deliver alpha, meaning, we have information, we have data, we have a way of working that no one else can do or is going to unlock a new way of thinking for you or an ability to deliver to a customer or an ability to solve a problem. Right now, you have an ability to access this level of information. I have an opportunity through our resources or through this gated data, we have access to get you much further upstream so that you can get information faster sooner. It's kind of like the high-frequency trading that one second, that one second. They didn't do much. They didn't sell, "Oh, we're doing fiber cable connectivity. We're giving you one second of alpha before everyone else." It's more of that ability and that's not problem-selling, that's opportunity selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:14):
I like this phrasing of just giving them alpha, that's such a simple way to imagine what this should feel like. We'll link to that image you're talking about with the Mario and-

Jen Abel (00:13:22):
You know that image?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
Yeah, the person that made that image originally is Kathy Sierra, if you remember her, do you remember? So there's this person, Kathy Sierra, she's from back in the day. This was a big, I don't know, lesson she taught is you want to not sell your people on a feature or a product. You want to sell them on them becoming a superhero.

Jen Abel (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
They are now a superhero because of the thing you've built for them. And so the vision here is here's how you become a superhero. Here's how this alpha will help you become more successful.

Jen Abel (00:13:50):
And that's why founders are so good at selling because they naturally go to vision selling and vision casting versus a typical trained salesperson is find the problem, ask these questions and it just kills the vibe. It just feels like you're talking to a salesperson, right?

(00:14:08):
It's like, "What's your script? And it's like that's not vision selling, that's like playbook selling." And in the age of AI where a lot of it is Alpha, it's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data, and look at how the market is reacting to it. It's all opportunity and it's all about the alpha.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):
So just to make this more concrete for people, Sam, like sales person at Cursor, what would be an example of vision casting? The obvious idea there is your team will be more productive, you'll get more done faster than everybody else. Is that a big enough vision to cast?

Jen Abel (00:14:47):
I think it may be more of you'll be able to actually hire the 10X engineers that you don't necessarily have access to because they want to be able to use this type of tool. It's about letting them get differentiated talent or that's probably more of what I would anchor to of this is the 10X engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10X engineers?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
They won't even join your company if you're not using Cursor.

Jen Abel (00:15:18):
Yeah, yeah. Think about it. So many people are so specific about what they're able to, I think especially technical folks, I'm not a technical person, but I would imagine that they're not going to go to, they don't like to go to these corporations because they're forced to use some incumbent tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Going back to going after these larger companies, I asked your colleague, Justin, what he sees you do that most impacts the success that teams have with their sales process. And there's a bunch of I'm going to touch on, but one is most founders are insecure about asking for large ACVs for charging, or the way he put it is most founders would rather get 10 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal. Talk about your advice there and what you see.

Jen Abel (00:16:04):
There are in the very early days is people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you because that's like a qualification criteria, which is like if they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you being like, "No, I don't believe it's worth this. I don't believe it's worth that." They're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

(00:16:32):
So when I say I'd rather get $100,000 deal than $10,000 deals, I'd rather have one rock star client that's going to help me figure out the next stage of where this is going than 10 or maybe five that are a good fit, five that are not, and I still have to serve those five that are not a good fit, and that's going to distract me. So this is why I love enterprise sales is they're not going to do the hard work of bringing you in if it's not critical or if it's not, when I say critical, it's going to impact them in a way that they're going to make it successful, that's what I love about enterprise sales.

(00:17:14):
They have the resources to ensure that it gets implemented because most in today's day and age, if people are not using the tool, you just get rid of the tool. So they're going to want to make sure whatever they bring in, what they go to bat for, remember, they go to bat once every two years, maybe once every three years. You've got to make it feel incredible. You've got to make it feel like they're going to be a superhero going back to it.

(00:17:42):
Otherwise, what's the point? Because the way enterprises are structured is it is designed today to make it hard to buy because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing in, you really, really want it gets rid of the mediocre. I think this would be good and it gets to this is going to change the way we work. It's going to impact our ability to capture some form of alpha, however you want to define that for them and it's sticky because of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):
So your advice here broadly is don't pay attention to the smaller 10K-ish kind of opportunities for a bunch of reasons. One is it might be giving you a false sense of success in product market fit. Two, those companies are maybe not as innovative and won't lead you in the right direction. Three are probably discounts just like your product than your pricing just gets thrown off.

Jen Abel (00:18:38):
Yep, and also you don't really get taken seriously for 10K. You get way more taken seriously for a 100Ks, it's much harder to get a 100K deal done and an executive use needs to be involved. I'd much rather have an executive sign-off on something and spend two more months getting the deal done because you know that they are bought in, you can now ensure what kind of value do they want to unlock and maybe you have an opportunity to turn them into a user, which to me, in today's day and age, with our generation being the ones that are now the executives at these corporations, this is native to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:15):
Who is this true for? Is the advice here basically, if you're trying to build a successful B2B company, everybody should be aiming towards these a 100K sort of deals? Is there a world where you can be successful with 10Ks for a long time?

Jen Abel (00:19:30):
If you have a super high win rate in a massive market, because all you have to do is reverse engineer the math. If you need to generate a hundred million dollars in revenue, how many 10K deals do you need? And the expansion on a 10K deal is in parallel to that. Where can you go? 10 to 15? That's a 50% growth, much easier to go to a 100K to 500K because they want more bodies or they want more value out of you.

(00:19:58):
For an enterprise, they'd love to get more out of an existing customer. You're already trusted. So it's also about the type of company you are. If you're venture-backed, you can't be selling $10,000 deals to the enterprise, you'll get killed, or you've already lost the game because you're playing a small business game in the wrong sector.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):
Have you seen startups you've worked with succeed in that 10K, 20K bucket or is it really, really rare?

Jen Abel (00:20:23):
If they're going after the enterprise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:20:25):
Yes, if it's the first three months and then after three months, it turns into a 50K and then a 100K and it ramps up quickly. Sure, that makes sense. You got your foot in the door and you can expand it exponentially in a healthy manner. I think that that's fine. $10,000 a year, then going to 12, then going to 15, the math will break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
This is great. I feel like most founders to this are like, "No, no, we're kind of in that exception we'll be all right. 10K, we'll do 20K. That's crazy to consider 100K."

Jen Abel (00:20:52):
Yeah, the math will break. And also, a really good salesperson, you're commissioned on a 10K deal, they're not going to get a great salesperson. They're going to want to be anchored to how can I sell a $250,000 deal? How can I sell a half a million dollar deal? That's the type of person you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
And a big part of this is this is a good lens to force you to build the product that you can sell for 100K, 500K.

Jen Abel (00:21:19):
Yeah, absolutely. And again, this is about playing that enterprise game. If you're trying to sell, if you're a small business, if you're in the small business place and an enterprise company comes to you and is like, "I like this." Ensure that you structure it for an enterprise. Don't play the small business team with an enterprise company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:38):
Talk more about that. What does that mean?

Jen Abel (00:21:40):
Let's say you're PLG, and a big company like Walmart comes to and is like, "Hey, can we get access for three of our users?" And they're like, "This is so exciting." And then they sell them the small business pricing for three users to Walmart. Very, very hard now to go from those three users that you just priced them at in a small business way, turn that into 100K because now it's documented what they're actually paying for this.

(00:22:08):
So you're stuck. You've kind of anchored yourself to this price. Not to mention how are you going to unlock the executive high level value so that you can get that senior executive to buy in and stamp this as well. Otherwise, it's just going to be throwing it on the credit card. But again, you've just ruined your enterprise game because you're anchoring to a small business price.

(00:22:34):
So this is why when you bleed these two games, it's very, very, very dangerous because these are really smart companies. They're going to say, "Well, wait a second, I just paid $9,000 last year and now you want to charge me $90,000. Well, what's the step change in value? What's the 10X value I'm now getting?" That's super hard to prove.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):
So the tip here is your initial price will really screw you if you get it wrong. And so obviously we're not going to give people the answer on their pricing strategy fully, but just is the advice just charged more or what would you recommend?

Jen Abel (00:23:08):
It is enterprise companies are very used to a land, when I say the first initial contract, somewhat between 75K and 150K, very used to that. In fact, that's probably where you want to start because you also want to understand where can you grow from this. Start contained, don't say 150K and sell the farm. Say, "It's 150K, here's who gets access, here's the value we're going to deliver and here's where we're going over time." You also want them to know, "Here's what we plan to do roughly in year two, year three."

(00:23:42):
I know it's hard to look that far out, but plant the seed with them in terms of where this is going. If you come in at $10,000, even if they want to bring you in and want to spend 100K with you, they have to be able to defend that and now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy, especially because a lot of them are using AI now to understand contracts. So they're going to quickly say, "Oh wait, you spent a thousand dollars with Lenny and now Lenny is asking you for a 100K. Great. Just help me understand why or defend it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
I could totally see ChatGPT being like, "This is interesting."

Jen Abel (00:24:19):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
It used to be 1K, now it's a 100K. What might be going on here?

Jen Abel (00:24:22):
Totally. The people don't realize how, again, know the game you're playing and don't be sloppy about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
So your advice here is really interesting. There's the land to expand. Expand is very important, but the landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point.

Jen Abel (00:24:45):
1,000%. That's exactly right. You said it better than I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:48):
And so you may see in theory if you land a 10K go to 100K, that's an amazing NRR, everyone's going to be really impressed. But you're saying people won't buy into that. It's going to feel absurd and wrong.

Jen Abel (00:25:00):
Unless it's defendable. All it needs to be is defendable. But who can really defend? That's very hard to defend a 10X. 10X jump, they're going to want to see 15X value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:11):
Let's talk about design partners.

Jen Abel (00:25:12):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This is something most founders try to do. They find a few folks to work with, to help them build the thing. What's your advice on when to start finding design partners? How to find design partners, what a good relationship looks like?

Jen Abel (00:25:24):
Design partners are incredible. They're the hardest logos to upsell, meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer. So don't expect these people to be your million dollar pipeline. Expect these people to be the guide, to help you understand, maybe design partners could be a technology company in the Fortune 1,000.

(00:25:50):
So they're used to experimenting. They're used to technology, they're used to, they were once a startup, so they get it. Those make really good design partners. Most of the design partners that I've closed are usually technology based. They get it and they also are excited about advancing the org and also giving the team an ability to have that startup feel.

(00:26:12):
So if you're a large massive corporation like Stripe. Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe as much like that 50 person startup vibe, but this can be a gift to give them that lens and give them that voice and give them that excitement that they don't get as a larger company. But those are great types of logos to be early design partners because one, they want to make sure they continue to stay on the cutting edge, but two is they are, to try and build something without that guidance is really, really, really hard because they're not using it.

(00:26:54):
So you need that user feedback and you also need to tie that to the executive value. It's actually a lot, it's very hard to do, but if you can come out of it and upsell a design partner to a full rollout customer, such a huge win for the market for you, for your team, and also for your investors because it's the hardest customer to actually truly convert.

(00:27:23):
They've been it when it was messy, they usually got a low price point. But if you again frame it, say, "Listen, I would love for you to be a design partner. I want a little skin in the game to get you to point it. Here's where we want to go and you'll get a discount because you were in the beginning, but I'm setting the framing. Here's where we want to go with pricing. Here's where we are today. You'll always have 30% concession in perpetuity because you are there with us on day one."

(00:27:49):
So again, it's not about asking for $10,000 and then not expecting that design partner to upsell and keep it flat because there's no growth there. It's a flat. It's about getting that early design partner, set the framing, own the framing and let them know where you're going. Again, a $100,000 to these large logos if they want it, it's very easy for them to get it in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:11):
There's this really interesting underlying piece of advice of finding a company that pulls you in the direction that leads to success. A company that's kind of a visionary. There's the obvious companies that everyone is always trying to get these days, OpenAI and Anthropic and Stripe I think is one. And any advice for just picking the right early? What are signs that this is a company that will point you in the right direction?

Jen Abel (00:28:34):
I think they have to be part of a logo that is deemed startup-friendly or in that world, and then I think it's the person, is this person excited to give feedback? Does this person buy in to where we're going? Do they see this world differently like us? Are they in lockstep with the founder vision?

(00:28:58):
Are they excited to use a tool that's janky? Because it is janky in the beginning, but they know that where this can go can be incredible. So I think it's really about the person and making sure that they're aligned for what they're getting into, and I think a lot of salespeople oversell it. I think that's a common thing that happens and that leads to churn, that leads to frustration, that leads to sometimes just canceling the contract.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
They oversell the initial kind of design partners phase over the product.

Jen Abel (00:29:33):
They sell everything. Yeah, design partner, even full rollout, and it's so, so important to tell them, "Here's where we are today. Here's what we cannot do." Which is just as important. It builds trust. "Here's what we will allow you to do in the next six months. Do you want to be on this journey with us? And it's really ugly right now." Right? "Barely anything exists, but we would love your voice to be a part of it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:55):
One of the biggest fears I think founders have is having a company pull, basically build just for their use case and then it ends up not being used by a lot of people. And so how far do you go fixing their specific problems? Any advice on just how far to go with one company?

Jen Abel (00:30:10):
That is the founder's job. The founder's job is to have a clear vision and do not let anything delineate from that. It's important to take feedback in terms of what is the market's reality, but it is the founder, and this is why being a founder is so hard. It is the founder's job to interpret that because a lot of feedback you get is this is the old way, they're responding this way because it's the old way of working.

(00:30:37):
They want you to build this because that's how they're traditionally expecting to do that. It is not, "Here's where we're going, this is why we're not doing that. I hear you, but here's why we're not going to do that because we're going to completely change the way you do this." That is the founder's job.

(00:30:53):
And I think we did a bunch of design partnerships late last year and there was a lot of feedback given, a lot of feedback given, but the founder had such clarity with where he wanted to go that he was like 80% noise, 20% had I not asked this question, I wouldn't have gotten that gold in terms of where they are today. And it's that 80/20 rule where 80% of what they're going to tell you is probably going to be not related to where you want to go or based off of the old way, but that 20% of, "Oh, I did not think about it that way." That drives everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Have you seen a design partner pull a company in the wrong direction? Just screw their path? Have you seen that or is that pretty rare?

Jen Abel (00:31:42):
No, I don't think it's that rare. We hear people complain about it all the time, but I think it's more of an excuse.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Coming back to this question of going after the enterprise versus SMBs. And again, early advice you gave is there's no, don't go in between. Either pick SMB small company, which I know you said there's a million ways to differentiate what this means, but I guess I think of employee numbers under some number over a thousand is maybe enterprise. Is that a good way to think about it just like-

Jen Abel (00:32:13):
Yeah, it depends. Are you selling per seats or are you selling based off of usage or are you selling off of, I think it also depends on the pricing model a little bit. I look at headcount too because it's just such an easy way to think about it because you can also gauge usage off that and a bunch of other things, but sometimes the small companies, I think we're going to see a lot more larger companies become smaller because of AI, not significantly smaller, but also high margins allow them to experiment more too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
That's such an interesting point you're making there that the way we designate enterprise versus SMB like may shift because number of employees may go down with AI.

Jen Abel (00:32:57):
Yeah. Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:59):
So interesting. So where I was going to go with this question is when people are deciding, I'm going to go enterprise versus I'm going to sell to startups, like YC companies are the typical example they sell to their own YC batches and you just broad advice of picking, "Okay, we go enterprise versus no, let's actually go startup."

Jen Abel (00:33:18):
I think it's about, and I read this somewhere and I wholeheartedly agree with it because I've seen it live. I think it's about what game does the founder best understand? Are they an incredible marketer and have some competitive edge for how they can win a massive audience?

(00:33:34):
I would say go SMB and marketing led or are they a bit more really understand how large corporations work and really excited to deliver on $100,000 plus type of opportunities or the value that they are building for is way more relatable to an enterprise versus a small business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):
That is really interesting. I've never heard of it described that way. I think about linear, which started very startup-ey and my take is they did that because changing the way you work is really hard and their bet was like, "Let's start with companies and grow with them and over time that becomes the default." Any reaction to that?

Jen Abel (00:34:16):
I think that it sounds like that that's a great way to work because that's a technical tool, so that you need the right, also need to have the right infrastructure to sell. I think Slack, look, Slack and Microsoft Teams are still battling it out at the enterprise. I think it's also how you plug in and how you integrate and do they even have the right systems to support you? The thing with open AI is they didn't have to connect to anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):
Say more about that.

Jen Abel (00:34:46):
So the value, people were bringing their own use cases to it and it's not like they, well they can ingest and they built that, it's a brand new thing and they started I think, this is someone told me this, so this could be hearsay, but I believe that they were already speaking to CTOs even well before they released to help them explain where this is all going and get their buy-in.

(00:35:17):
And it's much easier to get into the enterprise when you're like, "We won't even touch your data, won't even touch your data. Just use it to solve problems and then we can build trust and then start to integrate and connect the pipes." But part of the challenges with selling in the enterprise, they're like, "All right, well let's connect all your data in the ..." "Whoa, that's extremely risky."

(00:35:41):
So you have to start small and low risk, which is like, "Hey, what is the subset of consumers that churned? Let's figure out how we could have made them happier, whatever it be." So that data is lower risk. So again, it's also understanding your market and understanding what their ability to experiment is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:03):
It's interesting this distinction between OpenAI right now, and Anthropic, I don't know if you've been seeing their growth, it feels like OpenAI is very consumer first and Anthropic is more and more winning on B2B. I saw this chart recently where they're overtaking OpenAI now on B2B. I don't know, any reaction there of just these two different approaches?

Jen Abel (00:36:23):
I don't because most enterprises I'm talking to mentioned Gemini.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:27):
Oh, interesting.

Jen Abel (00:36:30):
Or Microsoft Copilot. So I don't hear much about Anthropic to be honest. So that might be more of a small business startup-ey, I don't know or it's a different part of the organization that's using it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):
Yeah, that's a whole discussion or bundling right there of Slack and teams and then just Gemini just kind of coming in automatically. People don't have to adopt anything new.

Jen Abel (00:36:54):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:55):
There's something else that you talk about that I love that I don't think people talk much about, which is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:37:03):
Oh yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:37:06):
So I personally believe that small business sales is really a, I used to think it was more science than art. It was more figuring out what didn't work, running experiments, testing and validating, which I do believe, that's to get to foundations, where do we play? What do we want to do? Like that early, early, early zero to one.

(00:37:33):
From one to 10, I think it's more of an art, which is how do I take my learning and how do I package it up where I own the framing, I can speak to very specific alpha, I can vision cast and where I better understand the problem over time better than the market does. And it's all about deal crafting.

(00:38:00):
They just need to feel like the value they're getting out of it is way more than the cost. And it's sometimes about giving away things that don't really cost much to you, but are super expensive for them. For example, "Hey, we're selling X tool. We can build out Y specifically for you over the next year and integrate it because I know that you would've spent X number of dollars on engineering resources or you wouldn't have gotten in engineering head internally to do this, but we're just leave it to you. You got to give us a year to build it out."

(00:38:37):
Again, you're not letting them sidetrack you too much, you're kind of containing it. "We'll do that for you at no additional cost." That's huge value. Right? Or, "Hey, we're going to run an event and we want you at the forefront of it. We want you to be a speaker." Huge value. So it's like all of these additional things that add value beyond just the product but are all part of the product and the vision. Everyone keeps thinking the product is just what goes into their hand.

(00:39:07):
The product is pricing. The product is the opportunity, the framing and not letting them compare you to something else. And I know we talked that on our first call, which is as soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation and it's all about here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
So along those lines, it reminds me in our first chat you actually made this point that I've never heard anyone else make, which is that services are a really good way to start getting into the companies that were most founders here. Like, "No, don't do manual stuff for the company. Build a product that you can scale." Your advice is the opposite. Actually start with self-services. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (00:39:59):
Enterprise is the number one thing they buy services, they know how to do it's super easy, they do it all of the time. It's like the most consistent thing they do. It's their largest budget item, external resources, consultants, whatever.

(00:40:13):
If they have a very immature way of understanding the problem or they've never purchased technology to solve it to some extent, either one, you are doing something that's never been done before, which is rare in today's day and age, or they might just be laggards on the journey. So you have to decide is this someone you really want to be working with? And if so, selling them as service, even though the technology is powering it on the backend is the fastest way to get your foot in the door.

(00:40:50):
It's what they know how to buy. Now, the idea is to once you sell that surface, once you get that foot in the door, then it's to guide them towards the product. "Hey, you're spending so much here, why don't we get you to come in and leverage the tool that's been powering this the whole time and move this more into technology serving you versus the human."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:12):
Wow. I think this will blow a lot of people's minds.

Jen Abel (00:41:15):
Palantir, this Forward Deployed Engineer, that's exactly what they're doing. There's a lot of companies out, I'm sure OpenAI, and this is what someone told me they were in and talking to CTOs and helping them better understand how AI and their organization can better work together. And it was them coaching them, educating them, whether they did it for free or not, I don't know, but they got their foot in the door, they started to build trust and then it gets adopted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:40):
This is the epitome of doing things that don't scale that advice we always hear this is like, "Okay, this is what that looks like. We will solve this problem for you. We are using software to do it." And then over time, "Oh, you could just do this yourself. It'll cost you less. You can scale this."

Jen Abel (00:41:54):
Yep, that's right. And they don't even need to know at first that software's doing it. That could be the magic part, which is like, "Guys, we literally, we are literally doing this with our technology."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:05):
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows.

(00:42:20):
Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy to organize tab.

(00:42:52):
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time.

Coda.io/lenny.

(00:43:22):
There's a lot of talk these days about this idea forward deployed something volunteer was really famous for, just essentially an engineer sitting in your office solving problems with you basically as an employee. And then through that, they learn what software to build. Is that something you're seeing too?

Jen Abel (00:43:38):
Oh yeah, I think that a lot of companies, sorry, a lot of folks that serve the enterprise, they have a butt in a seat in their office. You look at these large consultancies like McKinsey, they're not in their headquarters, they're in their client's office all the time. And the other interesting thing and proof of this is how many people go to a Deloitte or Accenture and expect them to be a channel partner?

(00:44:02):
This is exactly what this is all about, which is they sell this service, they come in and then they introduce, "Hey, look at what this startup is doing over here. You might want to give them a shot. The problem with channel partnerships and why I don't believe in them is there are a hundred of you on this list and you're expecting them to sell it on your behalf."

(00:44:21):
Biggest no-no, they're not vision casters, they're not visionaries, they're consultants, but it goes all towards go. I remember startups saying, "Oh, I'm going to go win over Accenture and then have them disseminate me into their clients." And I'm like, as if that's a workable strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:41):
Okay. You know what might be helpful is, let me try to summarize some of the best pieces of advice you've shared so far. And this is specifically for folks trying to go from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR. And then I want to ask you just what's most different about these two stages, but let me share this first. So advice one is go for tier one logos earlier than you think you should because they're early adopters, they can move fast, they can pull you in the right direction.

Jen Abel (00:45:09):
And they excite investors too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):
Yeah, for sure. And other leads are.

Jen Abel (00:45:14):
Yeah, and other talent, future employees. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:20):
So the counterintuitive insight here is you think they will move slow and be too busy, but they are actually the early adopters.

Jen Abel (00:45:27):
That's right. They have to maintain that number one spot. And also, all of the people that are in the number two, number three, number four spot, all want to do what number one is doing. So it's also pure referenceability too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:40):
And the point about them being the early adopters, the people that join the Stripes in OpenAIs and Anthropics are like they individually love technology and love the latest stuff. So as a human they're like, "Oh, this is cool."

Jen Abel (00:45:52):
That's exactly right. I'm just agreeing with myself, that's kind of funny. But yeah,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):
That's a good sign. So two is ideally try to price closer to about a 100K, like 75 to 150-ishK is what you said. Most enterprises are used to buying. So instead of starting or even sticking with 10K, 20K for too long, you need to make yourself go towards 75 to 150K.

Jen Abel (00:46:18):
That's right, yep. And if you were to sell a service, I know we're talking about selling services first, throw weight that over time, so maybe it's 10K a month. So they start to get used to what that pricing looks like.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:28):
So this is a way to make it feel, this is like how you get to 75 to 150K is there's a service attached to it. It's not just, here's my SaaS product, we will solve this problem for you, or a person will be sitting there doing this for you.

Jen Abel (00:46:41):
Or no, it's the technology too. You can add the services. I always, well let me take that back. Whether the services is bundled into it or not, some people will unbundle it, other people will say the services is a part of it. But yeah, it nets out to 75 to 150K. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:57):
Okay. And you said that it's okay to start lower on ACVs and deals, but you need to push fast towards a 100K over a few months.

Jen Abel (00:47:05):
Yep, that's right. If you can get into an enterprise for 10K in a month, which is not doable, but if you could, and you could go from 10 K to 50 K in four months through an expansion strategy all game, that makes sense, but it's really rare and very hard to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
And so there's two different paths there. One is land cheap and grow quickly. The other is move your ACV average up quickly. Seems like both, the latter is probably the more common strategy is just keep increasing prices.

Jen Abel (00:47:35):
Yeah, because the former you can get tripped up because they could say, "Okay, now give me an economical price for doing this for a hundred people." And then it all kind of evens out because now you're at the 100K deal anyway, but it's much, there's more room for error, which is why I say go in and try to land 100K.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:53):
By the way, in our first chat, we talked a lot about the procurement process, which is what trips a lot of people up and is really painful. And I vividly remember that conversation still. So if people are having issues getting through the sales process and procurement, a lot of good advice there.

Jen Abel (00:48:09):
And getting stuck in procurement is usually because you're not speaking to a senior enough person and they don't know how to navigate it, which is why I'm like that executive needs to be involved because as soon as the executive picks up a phone and tries to get a hold of their buying group, things move.

(00:48:27):
When people say, "Oh, I'm stuck in procurement." I'm like, "Oh, that could just be a qualification error and you never get out of it because you sold to someone too junior." So that's why the 100K is such a safe zone because even for 10K, you might have to go through procurement. So this is the surest way to make sure that you don't ... Listen, I've seen 10K take nine months to close.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):
No bueno.

Jen Abel (00:48:53):
Yeah, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):
Okay. Next piece of advice is this idea of vision casting instead of problem solving. So the advice here is instead of here's your problem, here's how our product solves it is here's how you will achieve alpha in the market by adopting the software. We talked about the example of cursor where if you adopt cursor, you're going to draw the 10X engineers that are joining other companies right now. This will give you a big advantage.

Jen Abel (00:49:16):
That's right. And yeah, it's pain versus opportunity, especially in the age of AI, and I know that we're moving into the next dimension. It's all about solving for a gap. It's seldom about solving for a very, very specific problem because people are trying to figure out what's our AI strategy? Where are we going to go with this? What is the world going to look like? I want to be a part of that new world. So it's a great time to be doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:42):
And then there's a bunch of advice you shared about design partners, of just how to select them. Your advice is definitely have design partners because they will help you build the right thing. But as a founder, you need to have a clear vision and sense of where you want to go and not just build everything they're asking you to build.

Jen Abel (00:50:00):
That's right, because important to say no. And that's all part of the framing, which is like here's, we want a little skin in the game. You set the price, but here's what we're marching towards in the next six to 12 months. Are we aligned there? If we deliver on what we say we're going to deliver, are we aligned there and do that kind of handshake?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
Is there anything else that I missed that you think is really important for this stage?

Jen Abel (00:50:29):
So one to 10 is no longer the founder. Maybe the founder comes in very strategic points, but you need a really good enterprise salespeople. Taking someone from small business and expecting them to do enterprise sales, big no-no, it's a different game, right? Vibe like a different game.

(00:50:47):
You need to understand how corporations buy. You need to understand how executives think. You need to better understand simply just what the enterprise business model is all about and their ability to take on risk. People will bring in super junior enterprise sales reps and I'm like, "You're looking to sell to an executive and you have this person that's five years out of school with no corporate experience doing it, again, unless they have some extremely deep experience in the industry or are just a unicorn in terms of, wow, this person can sell ice to an Eskimo kind of thing."

(00:51:27):
A junior person converting an executive, again, if the founder is involved, maybe that's doable, but usually the founder can't be involved in every deal and you need people that can, I always say you need people that can cosplay a founder, which is selling the vision, getting them excited, running through a wall to get the deal done and getting creative on ... None of my deals look exactly the same, every deal looks different and that's okay because every organization has slightly different opportunities of where they want to go, and you have to kind of build towards that and the framing may change.

(00:52:14):
So it's this ability to adapt from what you're hearing and let that compound over time, but I always say, can this person cosplay the founder? I think that that's the best type of salesperson because it doesn't feel like sales. It's more of the art.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:30):
This is amazing advice. What is a common profile that you've seen be successful? What level of seniority? What kind of personality and any traits to look for?

Jen Abel (00:52:38):
Maybe a former founder if you can get that, because they're used to selling, they sold investors and they've sold employees. Two is someone with no sales experience, but has deep product experience or an engineer and can think about things in a unique way where the market is like, "Oh, this is so interesting."

(00:53:00):
Taking a typical salesperson then and putting them into a sales role almost always is where people get frustrated. The market, it feels salesy. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy. And I know that it's very hard to hire a really good enterprise salesperson. The number of people that I've interviewed, I can count on my hand the ones that I get really, really excited by.

(00:53:29):
It's almost like coming across a great founder. It's not as common as everyone expects, and I think that that's true for engineering. I think that that's true for sales and I think a lot of people, sales is like, "Oh, just throw a body into it. The product will do the work."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:48):
Advice I often hear is don't hire a senior VP of salesperson from a bigger company. Do you agree with that? What's like to senior?

Jen Abel (00:53:55):
Yeah, so the bigger company thing, the brand was doing all of the work. The brand built the trust. You need this person to be able to build the trust and they're usually, the product is still so new. The product is the founder in the zero to one stage. The product is just starting to get a case study.

(00:54:15):
You probably have maybe a few references, but it's still very, very early days. You need the market to believe the salesperson and you need that market to know that they're trustworthy. A VP of sales at a large company, I would say, they're best suited for a large company because one to 10, you're running through walls.

(00:54:33):
You have to figure out, you're doing a lot of convincing, you're doing a lot of educating, you're doing a lot of creative deal crafting. A lot of owning the frame. It's not necessarily selling a product, it's selling that future value, which a VP of sales at a large companies, it's very different. It's a different game. It's kind of like the SMB and enterprise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):
It's interesting you said when you described the profile of a great hire here is you said they don't need to have done sales. If they have done sales, what's a number years or kind of what do you look for that tells you, "Okay, this is a good fit for the first hire."

Jen Abel (00:55:06):
I actually think it's less about experience and more about the person. Does this person make you feel good? Do you want to buy from this person? I think Jason, Jason Lemkin said that best. Would you want to buy from this person?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):
Can they sell you a pen?

Jen Abel (00:55:16):
The classic. Yeah, exactly. Do they mimic or mirror the market they're selling to? It's much easier to buy from someone that looks and feels like you than it does from somebody that's in a totally different realm. And also, an executive wants to talk to another senior person.

(00:55:41):
They don't want to talk to someone that just graduated from college and is selling them the new way of working. What do they know? So I think it's tricky. I would say someone with no sales experience makes it feel different and special, that's what I like about it. Someone with sales experience knows how to navigate and probably be qualified better, but it's almost like the blend of those two things.

(00:56:05):
And that's why I go back to cosplaying the founder, which is like, could this person close a future employee? Do they get excited about the problems they're solving internally and the vision that they get to sell to?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):
This actually was a reader question, listener question from Twitter. So Peter Dedenne asked, "How do you make this first salesperson as enthusiastic about the product as you? Is there something you could do? Is it more just they already are and you just leverage that?"

Jen Abel (00:56:36):
Incentives. Salespeople love to make money.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:40):
Easy.

Jen Abel (00:56:42):
So if they know it's possible, if they know it's possible, you'll be shocked what people can get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:49):
If they see how much they could make. Amazing. I imagine there still also has to be an innate excitement about the product and the opportunity.

Jen Abel (00:56:58):
They have to believe in it. They have to believe in the founder, but incentives usually make the world go round, but yeah, is this person, are they asking the right questions to the founder? The best thing to do is have the founder join the first five calls. You know after five calls if this person has what it takes, and don't be afraid to fire. One in every two salespeople usually are fired. Yeah, it's a very high failure rate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:33):
Because you can tell pretty quickly how it's going.

Jen Abel (00:57:35):
You can tell, or the vision of the founders is just very wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Speaking of incentives, do you have any quick advice on how to structure their comp? Just like how much they earn?

Jen Abel (00:57:45):
It's usually 50/50. So it's 50% OTE. So it's 50% base salary, 50% OTE.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:53):
And then how much of the sale do they typically get? Say the first sales hire.

Jen Abel (00:57:57):
It depends on the size of the deal, but in technology, it could be anywhere between eight and 12%. So rounds out around 10%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:07):
Okay. Awesome. When do you hire the first salesperson? Is it around the 1 million ARR mark usually?

Jen Abel (00:58:13):
Yeah, it's around that 1 million ARR, mark and I, and it's usually when you have your first seven to 10 customers and there's some pattern recognition around it that you can share with somebody else, there's some consistencies. Otherwise, it's just like that would be very hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):
Basically as a founder, you have to figure out how to sell enough times so that you can show someone, "Here's what's working."

Jen Abel (00:58:40):
And this is the common thing I hear, "Well, I'm a $10 million business. I'm in this small business space. You're $0 in enterprise." It's a zero to one right now in enterprise. It's a totally different game. It's a different value proposition, it's a different deal structuring, it's a different target market. It's a different risk tolerance. It's totally different. So don't be blindsided when-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):
It doesn't work.

Jen Abel (00:59:08):
... There's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen when you move into a new market.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
So the advice here is make yourself sell up until around a million ARR, especially if you're trying to go enterprise selling to enterprises yourself as a founder, which is really hard. You have so much to do and you have to be selling this thing for a long time time.

Jen Abel (00:59:26):
Yep. And then try and find someone that you get excited by. It's funny, if you ask the founder, are you excited by your salesperson? I'm curious what the real answer is. It's like, "Well, it's a button to see it in. It was hard to hire, so."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Interesting. I remember, I think it was Jason's advice was to hire two people immediately.

Jen Abel (00:59:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
So you can compare them. Do you agree with that?

Jen Abel (00:59:48):
100%. Yeah, because of the 50% failure rate. I think that's exactly right. So yeah, even a tall order, go find two people that are good. But yeah, I think that that's right because one in two will fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:02):
Okay, let me ask you another reader question from Hang Huang. This is kind of in a different direction. So he says, "The biggest challenge is always cutting through the noise to get that initial meeting with the right decision maker. How do you even get their attention?"

Jen Abel (01:00:15):
It's the vision. What is the opportunity that you're selling? That if they are excited by that, they will take a call. I see it all the time, and don't give away the farm. Keep it to three sentences. And I know I said this on our first call, but say something counterintuitive, they could feel different. Make it feel like they can learn from you by taking a 15-minute call. You see the standards of like, "Oh, I came across your LinkedIn." And, "Are you looking to grow your business by 15%?" It's like, "What kind of statement is that?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):
And this is in the cold email they get about this pitch.

Jen Abel (01:00:56):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
Awesome. So this is a good segue to another reader question from Hugo Alves, Co-Founder of Synthetic users. He asked, "What's the best advice for going from healthy inbound to targeted outbound?"

Jen Abel (01:01:07):
Healthy inbound usually is a marketing-led initiative. So that's a marketing game. It depends what deal value you're selling. Are you selling a $5,000 deal? It's got to be marketing-led to make the engine work. If you're selling $100,000 deal, you're doing outbound day one. So again, it breaks it into those. This is like that blending of the, I see a blending of that question. This is where you're doing small business marketing-led activities or are you a sales-led organization selling a $100,000 deal?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):
And the reason that's important, just in case it's not obvious, is you're not going to make money if you're selling. People are spending time closing deals that are making 10, 20K. Just the ROI on that won't work for your business model.

Jen Abel (01:01:51):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:53):
Awesome. By the way, let me just say, Jen, this is an incredible conversation already. We've gone-

Jen Abel (01:01:57):
Oh this awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):
... Through so much. This is exactly what I was hoping to get through and we've gone through so much advice that I think is going to be so helpful to so many people. There's a few things that your partner, Justin also suggested I ask you about that I want to touch on. One is you have this question you ask founders a lot that opens up their mind. You ask them, "If you give your product away for free, would people even use this?" And every founder is like, "Of course." And then you ask, "A customer this?" And they're like, "Nah, we wouldn't use this." And that just blows their mind. Talk about just the power of that and how you recommend people approach this.

Jen Abel (01:02:33):
I always say ask the questions you're afraid to because that truth is going to get you closer and closer to the answer. So I'll ask a client straight up on a call, I'll say, "Honestly, do we think we're going to get the deal done this year? Is it possible?" They'll give you the real answer and people are afraid to ask. But the other side is sort of if they're in it with you, they don't care about that question, right?

(01:03:01):
Can't ask that question on day one, but if you are, and we didn't talk about this, but maybe this is important. Every single enterprise deal I have done, the deal is done, the deal is closed and pretty much done through text. It's not on email anymore. It is a relationship you're building with someone where if my enterprise client called me, I'm picking up that phone immediately or I'm responding them to immediately because that builds so much trust.

(01:03:31):
If they know they can call on you, they're going to get you to pick up and they know that you're going to do everything humanly possible to make sure that this is successful. People will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, it's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible? And she's like, it's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it.

(01:04:00):
These are how enterprise deals gets done, it's relationships and it's this, and this is why I'm saying structuring the deal, make it feel like you went to bat for them and in often cases, you are going to bat for them and structure it in a way that makes sense for them. Everyone kind of just tries and pigeonhole. Pigeonholing and deal structuring consistency is important for a $10,000, sub-$10,000 deal. A $100,000 deal, it very commonly will look different every time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:32):
April Dunford was on the podcast and she shared this really interesting insight that the reason people behave this way is the person at the company buying this thing, their ass is on the line Also, their reputation is on the line for this thing to work out. So they want it to go really well.

Jen Abel (01:04:45):
That's right. Again, they do this one in every three years, one in every two years, maybe one in every five years. Hell, I don't know. They don't do this every year. It's very rare. It's no one likes a new tool. No one. Not you, not me, unless it changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:05):
Yeah. Figma was a great example, that's Slack.

Jen Abel (01:05:08):
Everything you've touched

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Everything that worked out. You said that you asked these questions that people are afraid to ask. What are some other examples of questions you often ask that people are afraid to ask?

Jen Abel (01:05:20):
I will say, "Listen, this is $150,000 engagement. I will co-author it with you where we can make this a little bit bigger if you need something else. We can make it a little bit smaller in year one, but in year two it steps up. How do we get this done so when you go to bat, it's a win?" Sell them, do they take it to the wrong side and try and discount you? I've actually never seen that because at that point you have a relationship.

(01:05:51):
So co-authoring the pricing is so important because they need to know that they go to bat, they can say, "I got this out of them. If we get this deal done." So this is why when I say every deal looks the same, you're asking great questions because it's explaining why I meant by that, but this is another example of why every deal in the enterprise sort of looks somewhat different because a lot of it is co-authored. So again, if someone wants a slightly lower price, give it to them, but maybe them lock them in a little bit longer.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
There's another point that Justin makes that you've touched on a bit, but it's when your no, the way he phrased it is, Jen always talks about how no is the best answer to yes because no is data that you can use. Talk about that.

Jen Abel (01:06:38):
I am a qualification crazy person. I will not get in on another call with someone because on the first call it's either a yes or a no, there's no in between. Humans are, we're so different and we're so unpredictable, but we're also so predictable at the same time, right? It's very obvious if someone is excited and wants to do something, it is so obvious when someone is just trying to be nice.

(01:07:06):
So I will say to them on that call, "I'm sort of getting the vibe that this might not be a good fit or might not be good timing. Did I misinterpret that?" And they will usually say, "Yeah, you're right, it's probably not a good fit." And then immediately, "Great, I would love to stay in touch. You've just saved a relationship and you've just saved yourself a ton of time."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
And the implication here is just to your point, you're limited on time. You don't want to be spending time going down or rival that won't you anywhere.

Jen Abel (01:07:24):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:33):
I'm going to take a quick tangent on tools. What's the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (01:07:39):
I don't use a tool because I believe in the manual and I'll explain why. Every single note I send is slightly different because I see a picture of them and I'm like, "Oh, I don't know if that's going to land." Or I'm like, "Oh, they actually might appreciate this. It's weird." Visual cues are so helpful. A picture is a visual cue, looking at how long they've been in the role, looking how long they've been at the company.

(01:08:05):
I use all of these little things and I seldom customize a note in a way that people expect which is that first customized sentence because AI does that, and everyone's doing that. So I go the opposite extreme, which is like remove it and I customize it with how I frame it or the subject line. So it's like if I'm talking to someone like a peer, I might say quick question like QQ.

(01:08:36):
If I'm talking to someone that has a bit more experience, I might write a little bit of a tighter note, not all lowercase. So it just depends on who you're speaking to. And again, this is why it's okay to spend a little bit of time on this because it's a hundred thousand dollars. It's actually a million dollars at the end of the day because a $100,000 deal if you play your cards right turns into a million dollar deal over three to five years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
I love how much you enjoy this. It's so fun to, so essentially what are you doing? You're sitting on LinkedIn finding folks to ping and then you cold email them one individually, manually.

Jen Abel (01:09:13):
It's so weird, Lenny, I have no process. I kind of just go with the vibe. I'll read an article about Tesla and I'm like, "Huh, they could be interested in this." Not because that article had anything to do with the problem I'm solving, but because I'm like, "This feels like a good Tesla day." It's hard to describe. It's a very emotional thing for me, and not to toot my own horn, obviously, but I've been successful in sales and the most successful sales people can't explain why they're good at it.

(01:09:51):
It just comes to them naturally. It's just like an emotional thing. It's like the world's best founders. How do you be a good founder? It's very, very hard to define. How do you become a good engineer? Very, very hard to define. So I don't believe in playbooks. I believe that there's a feel to it. I emailed a chief legal officer at a hedge fund once and he responded to me because I wrote to him on Saturday. I knew it was going to be busy. I made it one sentence and it was tweaked for him.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:29):
Do you feel like this is going to be the way as AI SDRs just kind of take over and everyone's getting billions of emails that feel AI-ish?

Jen Abel (01:10:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
So I guess maybe speak more there. Just like is the alpha essentially just become human? Don't automate? Should you think you should?

Jen Abel (01:10:49):
The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. So I'm like, "I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick-or-treating."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:04):
And this is effective for very large deal, which is what you need to be doing anyway because it takes a lot of time to do it this way.

Jen Abel (01:11:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:12):
Interesting. So you're not like sitting in Clay, you're not like Apollo, I don't have all those tools. You're just finding people yourself.

Jen Abel (01:11:19):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):
Do you start with a target prospect list at least just like, "Here's the companies that are the perfect fit for this and let's work through them."

Jen Abel (01:11:30):
It's all in my brain. I've been doing this for so long, I have in my brain, I'm like, these are my early adopters. These who I'm going to go to after I close those logos, they get excited by those logos. So it's just experience of you land a Walmart, you're going to go to the rest of the industry and say, "Hey, we're working with Walmart." Versus you go to some lower end enterprise company and they're like, "Wait, what do you do?" I can't even comprehend.

(01:12:02):
Also, the most strategic people, some of the most strategic executives are at these tier one logos. That's why they're tier one because they've got super smart, really capable folks. They also extract the best talent, the best talent likes to experiment and continue to improve. So it's like this compounding thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:20):
For someone that isn't Jen and has all this experience, say their founder, they're hit a million ARR. They're just like, "Okay, where do we find our customers?" Do you have any advice for just coming up with who we should go after? Should they be using these tools? Should they be hiring someone like a Jen? I know this is what you do for companies. So one crowd is go hire JJELLYFISH to help them through this.

Jen Abel (01:12:39):
Founder, the founder. I would say the founder, this is sort of in tune with them in a way. They just have to find it. It's so weird to say it's all, and I hate saying it because it's like a commonplace thing to say, but it's like there's this thing about flow and it's like some of these brands are in flow with you right now, right? You found this insight from somewhere. Who else? What's the next adjacent ring of people that would buy into that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):
And so what I'm hearing is just pay attention to what's happening, what companies are-

Jen Abel (01:13:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:25):
The news, what companies are doing interesting things, who are the kind of early adopters in the market.

Jen Abel (01:13:29):
If it was just a database list and it was just about figuring out the right messaging and then emailing folks, we would've known by that by now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:39):
That's so interesting. Okay, maybe one more question. This again is from Justin. He shares that when you hit resistance, you never argue, you reframe. If someone says, "We already have X solution, you'll agree and pivot and totally X is great for this thing, but here's what we can do."

Jen Abel (01:13:55):
This is why it's sell to the alpha. Hey, I know. Listen, that problem you just described, you're right. You have a tool for that. We're taking you much further upstream with value. This is the opportunity I want you guys to have access to.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):
I love it, Jen. I've gone through everything I was hoping to get through. On the other hand, I feel like we could do another hour on all these things, I feel like we need to do.

Jen Abel (01:14:17):
We have three.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):
Yeah, we need round three on the next phase and all the things that people want to dig further into. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or share?

Jen Abel (01:14:30):
This stuff is really hard. It's very hard. Sales is also all about learning very, very quickly from the rejection. The rejection is good because it's a forced learning and you never want to go through that again, but you have to be, I don't like to use the word cringe. You can't be afraid to cringe is like bringing your AI recorder into a call, that's cringey, but sending 15 notes to people that you can deliver serious value to, don't be afraid, and don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. Be different.

(01:15:12):
The whole game is about, "Oh, this feels different. That's what people want access to." Yet everyone commoditizes themselves. They try and mimic what everyone, they try and mimic a forward deployed engineer. Just rename it. You don't have to use the same nomenclature. Everyone gets excited by the new because the new could be the next thing, the thing that changes it all. So that's why I'm always like, "Don't be better. Be different."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:40):
An amazing way to end it. With that, Jen, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Jen Abel (01:15:48):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):
First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Jen Abel (01:15:54):
I do Twitter accounts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):
Oh, Twitter accounts to follow? Oh, amazing.

Jen Abel (01:15:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):
Okay.

Jen Abel (01:16:00):
Lenny, the day I have time to read a book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):
Period.

Jen Abel (01:16:05):
Period. I would love to be reading books.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):
Cool. Twitter accounts to follow. Tell me.

Jen Abel (01:16:11):
Yeah. Look, obviously you, you produce some of the best content, truthfully,

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:16):
Appreciate it.

Jen Abel (01:16:18):
You get into the minds of people that they're not even giving this insight on Twitter. Who else do I absolutely love? Jason Lemkin. So for sales, Jason Lemkin is awesome, awesome follow for sales, and also he had a great, great recording with you. So link to that because that was a great piece. I actually learned a ton from Matt. I love Gavin Baker. Super nuanced takes. Takes a lot of obvious statements, but shares a lot of the non-obvious insight. He's great. Jason Cohen, have you ever had Jason Cohen on the cast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):
Jason Cohen, a Smart Bear Jason Cohen?

Jen Abel (01:17:00):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:00):
He's coming on the podcast at the end of the year or something.

Jen Abel (01:17:05):
Oh, that's awesome. What a great plug for him right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):
Yes.

Jen Abel (01:17:08):
Yeah, those three would be great. I know they're all men, but.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
Great tips.

Jen Abel (01:17:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:12):
Next question, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed? I know you said you have time to read.

Jen Abel (01:17:18):
This is going to be embarrassing, Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:22):
Baywatch.

Jen Abel (01:17:22):
Yeah. Baywatch channel. It's just so Numby, and it's like '90s classic. Baywatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):
Wow, I've never heard that one before. So this is original Baywatch with?

Jen Abel (01:17:34):
This is original Hasselhoff. David Hasselhoff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Yeah, Pamela Anderson.

Jen Abel (01:17:39):
Yasmine Bleeth. Pamela Anderson, the original cast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:41):
Amazing.

Jen Abel (01:17:41):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
Okay. Deep cut. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Jen Abel (01:17:47):
So the number one thing for me right now is an app called Playground, which is the pictures of my toddler that they upload into the preschool so I can get the daily updates on what's going on in preschool when he's not home.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
Amazing. I need that. We get emails and Google Photos. I would really love that.

Jen Abel (01:18:09):
Yeah, there was another one called ClassDojo. There's a few of them, but Playground is the one that this preschool's on.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):
Love ClassDojo. I'm a small investor.

Jen Abel (01:18:17):
Are you really?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):
I am.

Jen Abel (01:18:18):
Oh, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
How about that? Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to find useful in work or in life?

Jen Abel (01:18:26):
Yeah, be direct. Cut the fluff. Give me the bullet, not the paragraph.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):
Final question. I was told that by Justin that you've never read a sales book. You've just learned to do this. If you were to read a sales book, if there was someone else out there that you look up to, learn from, is there anyone else out there in the world of sales that you most respect?

Jen Abel (01:18:51):
I think Jason Lemkin has the strongest understanding of sales. His content is unbelievable. He speaks about it clearly and cleanly, I would say. And as I mentioned, unbelievable Twitter follow. I'm a big fan of his.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:51):
Awesome.

Jen Abel (01:19:06):
I've actually learned a lot from him too. The 50/50 thing or a higher two salespeople, he's spot on. Failure rate is actually probably higher than 50%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:15):
I love that guy. And he's so AI-forward these days. He's just building. He almost took down Replit with his complaints. It was a whole new cycle of how Replit-

Jen Abel (01:19:24):
He should interact. Sometimes he says things that are harsh, but you're like, "He's not wrong."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:31):
Love it. I got to get him back on the podcast.

Jen Abel (01:19:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:33):
Jen, this was incredible. This was everything I wanted to be. I feel like we just leveled up all the founders that have listened to this in their ability to close. We're going to just create all the economic value and a lot of happy VCs from all the sales that will be closed as a result of the advice you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to either work with you or follow you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jen Abel (01:19:54):
Twitter. Every new learning or mishap, I put red on Twitter, so it's like my personal diary and super responsive on Twitter DM.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:06):
What's your Twitter handle? Twitter handle.

Jen Abel (01:20:08):
It's double J, So J-J-E-N_A-B-E-L.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):
You did not make that easy for people to find you, but we-

Jen Abel (01:20:17):
Yeah, I know, I know, I know I didn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:20):
And the J is for JJELLYFISH, is that where the extra J is for?

Jen Abel (01:20:23):
Yeah, the double Js. Then also, well, someone else had the handle, so I was like, "I need my name."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Got it. By the way, just tell people what JJELLYFISH is in case that might be helpful to them.

Jen Abel (01:20:30):
Yeah, so it's a consultancy that helps folks in the zero to one stage, and now I'm at general manager of enterprise at State Affairs, which is basically giving citizens and corporations an inside peek into what's actually going on inside the state capitol building. State policy is way more impact than on you, than federal policy. Federal policy is written more about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:54):
Incredible. I've only recently learned that that's what you're doing these days, and that is super impactful and important, so thank you for your work there.

Jen Abel (01:21:02):
Even democracy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:04):
No big deal. Jen, thank you so much for being here.

Jen Abel (01:21:06):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was a blast.

# How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don’t want? | Jerry Colonna

## Transcript

Jerry Colonna (00:00:00):
We're socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else, especially in the entrepreneurial community. All our companies are moving up into the right. Every product is working. We don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency. A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):
Today, my guest is Jerry Colonna. Jerry is one of the most well-known and respected executive coaches in the world. He's co-founder and CEO of Reboot, an executive and leadership development firm grounded in the belief that better humans make better leaders. Prior to coaching, Jerry co-founded Flatiron Partners with Fred Wilson, which ended up being one of the most successful early-stage investment funds in the world. He's also a partner at JPMorgan Chase and the author of two books, Reboot and Reunion. As you might expect, this ended up being a very real and very open conversation about being busy and self-inquiry and the dangers of a growth mindset and the reasons that leaders and teams most often fail, and it's not what you think. Also, we talk about a very simple equation that Jerry and his team use to cultivate great leaders.

(00:01:37):
This is an episode that everybody should listen to and spend time with. It'll make you a better person, a better partner, and a better leader.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:19):
Well, thanks for having me, Lenny. It's really a delight to meet you and to be with you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:24):
I want to start with a very classic Jerry Colonna piece of advice that I've heard you share in other places, and I just want more people to hear this advice, and this is a question that you ask people when things aren't going their way, and I'll give you a hint. The question contains the word complicit.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:40):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
Can you share this question and why it's so important to ask this of yourself?

Jerry Colonna (00:04:45):
The question that I often ask is how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? And if it's helpful, let me break down the question a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
Please.

Jerry Colonna (00:04:58):
So I purposely chose the word complicit because complicit does not mean responsible, and that's a really important distinction. And as I often say, to understand the word complicit, think of the word accomplice. As I will share, you are driving the getaway car, you're not sticking up the bank teller. The second half of that question is I say I don't want. And sometimes people hear that question and they interpret it as, how have I been responsible for the shit in my life? And that is not the purpose of this question. The purpose of this question is actually to evoke your own agency, is to look at the ways in which you may have been diluting yourself.

(00:05:56):
A perfect example of that would be, I say I don't want to feel busy all the time, but the truth of the matter is I feel really unnerved and disconcerted if my agenda isn't jam-packed. And the reason that this is all really important is part of my approach not only to coaching, but to the process of growing up, is to use what I call radical self-inquiry, to really cut through our own delusions and say, how does it serve me to feel completely busy to the point where I feel exhausted? And perhaps there's another more conscious way of getting that feeling than feeling like crap all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:56):
This is a good segue to something that I hear you. You have this equation that you and your firm use to think about how to create and cultivate great leaders, and it includes one of the variables is radical self-inquiry. Can you share this equation and just how you work with folks to build this in them?

Jerry Colonna (00:07:14):
Sure. I'll tell a little story about that. I remember one time I was, this is how the equation came to be. I was doing a talk, I think here in Boulder at Naropa University where I used to be on the board of trustees. It's a Buddhist university, and as is often the case, I'm winging it as I go and I'm walking around probably without shoes on because that's what I do. And there was a dry erase board behind me and I was trying to explain what it was that I do, what it was that I encourage people to do. And I jumped up at the board and I wrote practical skills. And in writing that, what I was trying to convey, what it is that people typically come to a coach for. They want to understand how to do their job. They want to understand how to live. They want to understand the how.

(00:08:11):
And then, I wrote plus, and then I sketched out radical self-inquiry. And I said in that moment, I said, "People will come and ask me how, and I will drive them crazy because I will say something like, tell me about your father, or tell me why you chose to be in the job you're in the first place, or tell me about your relationship to money, or tell me about your relationship to self-worth." And then, I expanded it and I put another plus sign and I said, "Shared experiences." And then, I drew an equals equation line underneath the whole thing, and I said, "Enhanced leadership plus greater resiliency."

(00:09:05):
And so, the equation is practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences, that is the process of actually talking about the craziness that goes on in your head equals greater leadership. That all makes sense. But then, there was this other piece, enhanced resilience. And when I do this on a dry erase board, I will often circle that phrase, and I say that is the purpose of this whole thing, because the truth is, if you follow my story at all, you know that in my late 30s, the depression that had really marked most of my life had gotten so bad that despite my outward success, I was suicidal and lost.

(00:09:58):
And I will turn to the audience and I say, "I get you want to be a great CEO, I get you want to be a great executive, but what I really care about is you not killing yourself in the process." So if we take a step back, the whole point of what we refer to as the equation really boils down to that point, how do we grow up and become the leaders, the adults we were born to be without feeling like crap?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
And there's this huge implication here that a lot of people think that when they reach a certain point, become successful, make a certain amount of money, get a beautiful house, still be happy. And essentially what you're saying here is that's very often not the case. Maybe in most cases, not the case.

Jerry Colonna (00:10:48):
It's not only not the case, it's the big lie that we're socialized with since childhood. I remember one time I was on the road doing a talk for, I was promoting my first book, Reboot, and I was at, I think it's called the Fitler Club in Philadelphia. I was doing a fireside chat. And after talking with my conversation partner, a guy named Chris Fralic who was one of the co-founders at First Round, really, really good guy. We turned to the audience and there was a Q&A as there often is, and this young guy shoots his hand up and he introduces himself and he says, "I'm 19." And he looks over to his right and his mother's sitting there and he says, "And my mother brought me here," which I laughed.

(00:11:40):
And he said, "So what you're telling me is you don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And I could not think of a better summation of everything that I'm about than for a 19-year-old kid to look up and say, "You don't have to be an asshole to be successful." And of course, the corollary to that is you don't have to feel miserable just because you're trying to create a career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
As people start to think about this and think, okay, I feel like I've been heading in this direction of I just need to keep climbing the ladder, making more money, as they hear you talk, what's the pivot that folks should make in their mind around where they should actually be heading? What is a direction where they'll end up not wanting to kill themselves, in spite of being successful?

Jerry Colonna (00:12:34):
To be clear, not everyone ends up in that level of depression, but the hack, if you will, is consciousness. So what do I mean by that? Part of what makes radical self-inquiry radical is we're socialized not to ask certain kinds of questions. So for example, someone says, "It's really important for me to be ambitious and achieve a particular goal." What's radical, a radical question to ask is, and what will that do for you? What is it that you believe being "successful" will do for you? How do you define success? Where does that come from?

(00:13:30):
In Reboot, my first book, I tell the story of what I refer to as my pursuit of lemon drops. And briefly, when I was a boy, there was a lot... I grew up with an enormous amount of chaos and insecurity, financial and otherwise. And a big source of stability in my life were my mother's parents, my grandfather and grandmother. And Grandpa Guido, who was an ice man and emigrated from southern Italy in early 20th century, always seemed to have, well, he had this endless supply of lemon drops, and they were always kept in this green pantry outside of the kitchen. And for me, the stability and what I considered wealth seemed to match to this notion of this endless supply of lemon drops. And when I got to my 30s and I was outwardly successful and I was a hot shot BC, I had lemon drops, but I didn't feel safe, which was a mindful.

(00:15:02):
And so, I told that story in Reboot as part of my exploration into the core question of how did my relationship to money shape my career choices, shape my school choices, shape my own sense of safety and self-worth? So long-winded response to your question, what I encourage people to do is to ask themselves these kinds of questions so that they can raise their level of consciousness so that they can be in the driver's seat of their lives and not some learned behavior that they developed as a child to answer perhaps their parents or grandparents' anxieties.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
I feel like a lot of people hearing this are afraid to ask these sorts of questions. The reason they don't ask these questions is because they worry that this is going to be like, okay, I got to quit my job, move to the woods, give up all these luxuries they have. I don't even want to think about that. I got a whole family to support. I got to succeed. Advice for getting over that hump of just like-

Jerry Colonna (00:16:17):
So let's just pause, Lenny. Okay, so what you're doing in this moment is empathetically imagining what may be going on for your listener, but the empathy is actually based on your own question because you invited me on the show, you knew I was going to get to this point. So I'm imagining that as you take this in, that thought stream shows up for you. "Jerry," says Lenny, "If I open up that closet, all the shit's going to fall out, and what am I going to do with it?" Does that resonate at all?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:58):
This is why I was nervous to have you on this podcast. I knew what you-

Jerry Colonna (00:17:05):
So answer my question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):
I don't think it's that strong for me to be afraid of that because I've taken a different path already and gotten off the career ladder climbing treadmill. On the other hand, back to your original question, we talked about being busy. I'm very guilty of that. I'm constantly trying to do less, but constantly doing more, and my life is just very busy.

Jerry Colonna (00:17:28):
Thank you for giving me more of that answer. And trust me, your listeners are going to appreciate you being fully there in just the way you were. So let's take a step back. The fear is, if I can reflect back to your original question, the fear is if I go there, I don't know what's going to happen as a consequence of that. If I pause and ask myself, is this relationship working out for me? I might end up leaving this relationship. If I pause and ask myself if this career isn't working for me, I might leave my career.

(00:18:25):
And the good news bad news is that's true. That is absolutely true. And if we look at some of the other observations we were making before like anxiety and depression, we have this belief system that if I pay no attention to the thing that I'm afraid of, it's somehow going to magically go away. If we pay no attention to the source of discomfort, it's somehow going to go away. And that's not actually how life works. More often than not, what we do is we respond to the source of challenge, whether it's a discomfort in our relationship, whether it's a discomfort in the way my life has unfolded. We respond to it by plasting over band-aids and sometimes they're relatively healthy, we become obsessed with working out, or sometimes they're unhealthy. We become obsessed with work or substance abuse or that kind of thing. Or sometimes, and this is super popular right now, we lean into what I would call as a spiritual bypassing where we go to Peru and we go do ayahuasca or we spend the weekend doing mushrooms with friends...

(00:20:08):
And what we're really not doing, Lenny, is confronting the parts of ourselves that need some tending to because we're afraid of the consequences. But I'll tell you a quick quote. One of my favorite books is Bruce Springsteen's autobiography, and about in the middle of the book, he has this passage where he talks about having spent 25 years in psychoanalysis. So let me just let that statement land. Bruce fucking Springsteen, 25 years in psychoanalysis. And he has this passage where he talks about the unsorted baggage of our childhood. And what he rightly asserts is that we all have unsorted baggage, and at some point we're going to pay the price of not sorting that baggage. And the price more often than not is in tears.

(00:21:21):
Now, this is Bruce Springsteen talking about this. This is not some airy-fairy transpersonal Jerry Colonna coach. And the reason I draw that out is we as children are socialized not to develop these consciousness skills. We are socialized to develop what I would call bypassing skills. And as he correctly points out, if you continue to bypass sorting out your baggage, there's going to come a day where you're going to have to pay that price. It could be in your own depression, it could be in, I've seen this a thousand times Lenny, entrepreneurs sabotaging their successful businesses because the belief system from their childhood goes something like, I don't deserve success so let me blow it up. We put this all under the rubric of midlife, but I don't know, when does midlife begin, 35? When does it end, 70? What I do know is it's the bulk of our adulthood.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
Okay, I think you've done an excellent job convincing me and others to spend time on this now, and I think there's an assumption of it gets harder, the tears get more intense as you wait longer. There's this ticking time bomb that better some amount of tears now than 10 times more tears later. Is that right?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:04):
Well said.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):
Okay. So coming back to this equation, I think I want to give people some things to do now that they may be likely convinced, okay, I should really rethink what I'm doing. So back to the equation, practical skills plus radical self-inquiry plus shared experiences equals enhanced leadership and greater resilience. So the three things you can work on are practical skills, radical self-inquiry, shared experiences, skills I think people get. So radical self-inquiry, these are essentially questions to dig into what drives you, what makes you happy. What are some questions again that people should be asking there as they're listening or maybe after they finish listening?

Jerry Colonna (00:23:40):
In the time since I've been a coach, which is now going on 27 years, the popularity of journaling has gone up, which is awesome. And part of what happens is people journal, but they don't know what they should be journaling or how they should. So let me give some questions then, and this is a way to approach it. Let's imagine that what we're trying to do, whether we're sitting in meditation, whether we're journaling, whether we're taking time away, we're just pausing and starting to ask ourselves questions. So my famous questions include things like, what am I not saying that I need to say? So let's imagine ourselves in a relationship that's not working.

(00:24:30):
Talk about something that could be terrifying. What am I not saying in that relationship that I need to say? By the way, this is a good question to ask if one is responsible for leading people too. Corollary questions to that would be, what am I saying that's not being heard? And then, of course, what's being said that I'm not hearing? So if we just pause and look at those four questions, how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? And what's being said that I'm not hearing? Can you feel the power of all of that in those questions?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:25):
Yeah. Scary questions.

Jerry Colonna (00:25:27):
They are scary questions. You know you're in the radical self-inquiry zone when the questions take your breath away, when the questions, and by the way, you don't have to share the answers to these questions with anybody but yourself. Now, there could be some power in sharing them in a group of friends and sharing them with a group of colleagues, sharing them with a coach, sharing them with a therapist. But the most important person with whom you should share the answers is oneself. This is a little bit of Buddhism here. Self-delusion along with attachment are the biggest contributors to our own suffering. Self-delusion. Everything's great. How you doing? Everything's great. Bullshit. Can we just not bullshit each other?

(00:26:30):
So let me just pause. Those are just four questions. My first book Reboot has a set of questions after every single chapter. We also have a journal that we put out that has questions and questions, but the more important thing to take away from this is questions that startle us, questions that may cause us to be a little afraid of the answer, that's where the gold is.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:02):
And we'll point people to the book for many more of these questions and the worksheets. For the third party equation, shared experiences, can you explain what that is?

Jerry Colonna (00:27:11):
We were talking about socialization, for example. Prior to launching Reboot, the company, my co-founder, Ali Schultz and I, the roots of Reboot the company began with me designing, or Ali and I designing these boot camps. And the original iteration of the boot camp, we used to call CEO Boot Camp because it was originally we would get first-time CEOs together and we would do a bait and switch. We would pretend to sell them practical skills, and then I would start asking really tough questions like who would you be without the story of who you are? It's like what?

(00:27:57):
The notion of shared experience as an important component grew out of that. Because what would happen is imagine sitting in a circle of people who just have your back, who really care about you as a person. And imagine then discussing some of the answers to those questions. Who would you be without the story of who you are? What is it that you wish that people in your life knew about you, but you're too afraid to tell them? And imagine sitting in a group of people who can just hold that space without fixing you, without telling you what you're doing right or wrong? We, too often than not, especially in what I would say the entrepreneurial community are socialized to bullshit not only ourselves, but everybody else. All our companies are moving up into the right, every product that's working, we don't really have any problems because we're crushing it, and that's just a lie. Imagine having the capacity to be in relationship with people where you can just tell the truth. That's what shared experiences are about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):
My wife does a women's circle where they gather and just share what's really going on within in their lives. And it's-

Jerry Colonna (00:29:26):
That's it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):
And it's very confidential. There's a ritual to it, and it feels like that's a really good avenue for things like that.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:42):
What circle do you sit in?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
No circles. This is my circle.

Jerry Colonna (00:29:49):
But there is something powerful here. I think in the last 15 years, the rise of podcasts, good podcasts. What I think what happens is let's hope this is happening for your audience right now, good quality intimate conversation between people who are authentic and real, creates space for someone to be authentic and real, even if it's just with themselves. So you're doing a mitzvah, you're doing a good deed by creating this space.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:24):
Thanks, Jerry. Let's go back to the busyness point, and I'll talk about myself a bit to get it real again, because I think it's also something a lot of people struggle with. I listen to this, they're just like, I'm so busy, and every time someone ask me how I'm doing, busy, so busy, like swirly eyes emoji, swirly eyes emoji.

Jerry Colonna (00:30:45):
With a little head shake.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:47):
That's right. And the melting face emoji. And that's very much me. And it's funny because I started this journey of the newsletter of just like I call the project avoid getting a real job. And it was just like, cool, just do this newsletter thing, not have the job. It'll be chill, write an email once a week. But I just find myself taking on endlessly more and more. And for me, I feel like the drive is it's just fun to see it grow and for it to keep building and doing well.

(00:31:17):
This reminds me, there's a quote that Will Smith shared once that I think you'll like. Someone asked him what it's like to be famous, and he's like, "Really awesome as you're going up to fame. Pretty okay as a famous person. Really bad when you lose that fame." And that's how it feels with the growth of this thing. It's just like growth is up. Oh, life's good, and then it starts to stall. I'm like, oh, no, it's all going to fall apart. So I think that's where a lot of that comes from for me. It's just like, oh, what's next? I got to, let's see what else I can do here.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:44):
Well, how do you feel about yourself when you're on that growth trajectory?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):
I feel great.

Jerry Colonna (00:31:52):
Say more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
I feel like I'm achieving and heading in a... Part of it is just fun. It's like fun to win. So it's just like, yeah, we're doing it. It's working.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:07):
And when you're not growing, how do you feel about yourself?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:13):
About myself. There's this sense that it's all over. Oh, maybe it's all going to fall apart, and maybe I'm not as good at this as I thought, and maybe-

Jerry Colonna (00:32:25):
Okay, so stay in that spot for a moment. So imagine, and I don't know that this is true, but I can imagine that there's a little whispery voice in your head that's always there that says, "Lenny, you're not as good as you think you are. In fact, Lenny, they might even find out."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):
Yep. Yeah, imposter syndrome.

Jerry Colonna (00:32:52):
Oh, shit. So by being busy and by being on that growth trajectory, that voice maybe sounds a little less persistent, maybe a little less loud. Now, I want to offer a different potential. What if you could enjoy the puzzle of trying to create something new, trying to create magic, something out of nothing, but it doesn't matter to your sense of self-esteem if you succeed or fail. What if what drove you was not quieting that voice, but what drove you was, oh, this is just fun? Seth Godin, who's a dear, dear friend of mine, talks about art projects.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
Also a former podcast guest.

Jerry Colonna (00:33:57):
So what if you just approached the project as if it was an art project? I think it's going to show up this way. What if it turns out it's wrong? What if it's this? What if it's that? And your sense of self-esteem is not attached to the outcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):
What's interesting is that's how I started this whole thing. I had no intention of it being a career and way I make a living. It was just, this is cool, people seem to like it, I enjoy it. Let's just see where it goes. No expectations.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:28):
And then what happened?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
And then it worked.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:30):
It became successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:31):
That's right. It worked out.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:33):
Right. It became successful, meaning you developed an audience, meaning you developed a following.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:41):
And then, income. That was a big part of it.

Jerry Colonna (00:34:43):
And then you developed an income, and then the stakes went up, and then all of a sudden, my heart, the anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:54):
Not quite that strongly. At times it is, but there's a bit of just, oh, wow, I am relying on this now. I can't just let it fall apart.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:03):
Because my life would fall apart if I let it fall apart.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:07):
Yeah, life would change in a big way if this whole thing ends.

Jerry Colonna (00:35:11):
Right. Right. So what you're talking about, what we're talking about right now, remember before I said in Buddhism, we talk about self-delusion and attachment. Now, we're talking about attachment. When we become attached to the outcome, we inadvertently fuel our own suffering. When we become attached, and in this case, okay, I get it. There's a financial reality. This is important because it helps pay the bills, if it doesn't entirely pay the bills. Great. Got it. Fabulous. But really the deeper attachment is see, I'm not nothing. See, I'm not a nobody, I'm a somebody, and that's the source of the suffering.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):
That is so true. That is very much a part of what has driven me is I was always a very shy kid growing up, and I don't think people expected a lot of me except my mom and dad, I guess. And so, I always had the sense, I'll show them, I'll show them what I could do, and that's always, it's this chip on the shoulder thing that I know drives a lot of people.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:29):
How old are you, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):
43.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:30):
Okay. So maybe now at 43, you can take in the fact that you are somebody regardless of what you do. What's your wife's name?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):
Michelle.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:49):
Is she going to love you even if the podcast fails?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:36:55):
What, is she an idiot? No, she's a smart person. The people who actually know you and care about you may be proud of your efforts, but their love for you is not dependent upon its success. And that's like a rewiring. Do you have children?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
Yeah, we got a 22-month-old now.

Jerry Colonna (00:37:30):
Oh, mazel tov. That's wonderful. My children are 34, 32, and 28. So I'll speak like the old man that I am. When we take that test, that spelling test, and we stick it with magnets on the refrigerator, it's at a pride. The challenging message that we inadvertently can send to our children is that we only love them because they got an A on the spelling test. And so, it's really critically important that we as parents do our own internal work to convey that unconditional love that is our birthright as human beings. And we hold onto the goal because the goal is cool, because solving a puzzle is fun, because doing hard work and experiencing the reward from that is affirming, but your value as a human being is unshakable. Now, as a father, isn't that the feeling you want your child to have?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
Absolutely. And there's a lot of parenting advice these days that helps you learn to do that. There's all these TikToks now, don't say good job. Just say good choice or great, hard work. Great job working hard on that.

Jerry Colonna (00:39:04):
Right, right, right. I don't know how I feel about getting parenting advice from TikTok, but okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:12):
I'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.

Andrew Luo (00:39:19):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:21):
So what is new with OneSchema, I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.

Andrew Luo (00:39:37):
Yes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema file feeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?

Andrew Luo (00:40:11):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:32):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:40:46):
Just to close loop on this, I think as people hear this, I feel like, okay, cool, everything falls apart. Sure, my parents will love me, my wife will love me, they won't think less of me. However, it's nice to get that really nice couch and that nice hotel and the income, the comfort that comes with income at a certain level is hard to give up. How do you help people get past that that might go away and feel comfortable?

Jerry Colonna (00:41:09):
Well, the good news is, and again, this is a Buddhist reference. The good news is there's a wisdom tradition that teaches all about this. So very briefly, the Buddhist story is in his mid-30s, he wakes up to the truth of birth, old age, sickness, and death. Birth, old age, sickness and death. And he wanders into the forest and he becomes a wandering mendicant and he becomes a holy man, and he's still not satisfied. And as I like to tell the story, one day he decides, fuck it, I'm just going to sit under the Bodhi tree and I'm not going to move until I figure this shit out. And so, he sits and sits and sits, and the story is he sat for 40 days living on a single grain of rice every day because always right, crazy stuff.

(00:42:05):
And when he woke up, he woke up to the four noble truths and the four noble truths are life is filled with suffering, that which we do to push away suffering increases suffering. The third noble truth is that there's an end to suffering. That's a really important one. And the fourth noble truth is what's known as the eightfold path to the end of suffering.

(00:42:34):
So let's focus on the second noble truth because that's really what you're talking about. When we acquire that nice couch, when we buy that nice house that stretches our income to its maximum, if we're doing it to enjoy the couch or the house, then A-OK. But if we're doing it because we're trying to push away the suffering of am I good enough to be loved, to feel safe, and that I belong, that which we do to push away suffering will increase suffering. And in this case, oh my God, what if they take my house away from me? Oh my God, what if I fall backwards down that staircase of life? Oh my God, what if all of those people who have signed up to my Substack suddenly disappear? You see how the attachment becomes that source of suffering? You see how the thing that we do to make ourselves feel better in fact fuels the tenuous hold that we have on our OK-ness? I'm okay just as I am. I'm okay.

(00:44:03):
It all comes down to why we're doing what we're doing. Now, to be clear, this is hard for me. I think it's hard for everybody. When my first book came out, Dan Harris, who's a really good friend and client from 10% Happier said to me, "Don't read the Amazon reviews." The truth is, I've read two reviews. I read it in the first hour after it was released, and I've never read a review since because there's no way I can experience those reviews without becoming attached to how people feel. So thank you. I'll put it over here and I'll just stay focused on the experience that I get from writing.

(00:45:04):
And yes, do I want to sell thousands of books? Do I want people to feel moved by my writing? I do, but you know who gets the most out of my writing? Me, because when I sit down, this is my file folder for whatever I might do for our next book, what I'm trying to do is answer questions that I have. For example, Captain Chaos is running the country right now. What is it that the world is going to need two or three years from now? And what's my contribution to that world? Now, just as I say that, how does that feel to you? It's kind of settling. So I know that in order for me to feel good about my existence on this planet, I have to ask myself these questions and I have to attempt to answer these questions. Whether it turns into a book that people buy or not is secondary, I have to do this work regardless.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:22):
That super connects with exactly again, the way I started this whole thing is I started writing just to crystallize my own thinking, and it ends up being useful to other people.

Jerry Colonna (00:46:33):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
People hear this and they're like, why would I want to give up this great couch and house and car and all these things? That's really hard. And risking that by just doing something that feels good versus it'll make income, but it actually works. That's what I found. If you focus on a thing that is useful to yourself and interesting and not come at it from how do I make the most amount of money and turn this into whole thing, but more just, this is really interesting. I'm going to see where this goes. It will work for me.

Jerry Colonna (00:47:00):
Lenny, you implicitly asked a how question a few minutes ago. How do I do this? How do I do this radical self-inquiry? And I asked, I responded by offering a few questions. Let's build upon that for a moment, because what you are articulating right now is in the process of asking those questions, you can go back to what Simon Sinek would say is your why. You could go back to your core principle. You could go back to the centerpiece within you, which is what do I believe to be true about the world and how do I want to be in that world? You know what animates me right now is a question? With my children being fully fledged adults, I am really focused on what kind of ancestor to my descendants would I like to be? 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, I'll be gone. What would I like those who follow after me to believe to be true about me?

(00:48:11):
And you just paused. I can tell from the Adam's apple jumping up and down, that that question landed for you. It's a question of legacy. It's a question of meaning and purpose. At the end of my days, this is a question in Reboot, at the end of my days, what would I like the people who come after me to say about me? And what I want people to say about me is that he gave a shit about the world, he cared, and he tried, and he was kind. Those are the things that matter to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:00):
I'm always reminded of that frame of reference when I go to a funeral and people reading the eulogy and the old advice of what do you want your eulogy to say and making that your mission. But on the flip side, there's this viral video of Mike Tyson. Someone was coming up to him I think before his big match recently, and asked him about his legacy, and he's like, "I don't give a shit about my legacy. It's just a made up thing that doesn't matter." So let me just ask you this. Why is it important to think about legacy? Does legacy even matter? We're dead. What's the difference?

Jerry Colonna (00:49:33):
Far be it for me to criticize Mike, and don't hit me Mike, because even as an old guy, I wouldn't want to be hit by Mike Tyson. I don't know what's behind his response, but I can tell you what's true for me. I made oblique reference to Captain Chaos in the world as it is right now. The world's a tough place right now. We live in a world where it's almost normalized that a teenager will shoot other teenagers in school. It's almost normalized that people are dragged off to jail. Something is happening, something that's really disturbing.

(00:50:28):
Now, to be clear, we've always had disturbing times. I mean, I was reminded recently, I'm reading a book called Soldiers and Kings, which I highly recommend, which is about human smuggling from Central America into the United States, and it's an extraordinary book. And in reading that, I was reminded of policies that the US government has used over the years, whether it's supporting dictators in Central America or other sorts of things, things that I oppose, that feel immoral, if not directly immoral.

(00:51:15):
Why does this come up for me? I can't shake the feeling that someone down the line in my lineage is going to ask of me, "And what did you do, grandpa? And what did you do, great grandpa?" I know what I want that answer to be, which is I tried. Lenny, God gave me the ability to put two sentences together in a way that people listen. I feel a moral responsibility to use that God-given gift to help create the world, that I would like to see, a world of kindness and empathy, a world where poverty is diminished, a world where people feel safe however the fuck they identify. I don't give a damn. So is that my legacy? Yeah, and maybe there's some ego implicit in that, but can I go on for just a bit on this?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:54):
Absolutely.

Jerry Colonna (00:52:55):
At the end of Reboot, I write about this moment, and in this moment I am in Marin County. My wife Allie and I are together. And I'm once again torturing myself with this question. Have I been a good man? I drive myself crazy with that question. Have I been a good father? Have I been a good partner? Have I been a good man? And she says, in a very frustrated way, "All right, already. Enough. You're a good man. Stop." And so, I go for a walk, and as I'm walking, I encounter this toppled over oak tree and the roots are all torn up and you've seen trees like this, and clearly the tree died and clearly a wind came and clearly knocked the whole thing down. And I look at the tree and I say to myself, "Here lies a good man."

(00:53:57):
And I liken myself to this toppled over oak tree, and I imagine that that tree had lived its life with its limbs gnarled and twisted by actions that it should have taken and actions that it shouldn't have taken, but good choices and bad choices. But that for the majority of its 75, 80 years, it lived into its purpose of providing shelter and shade for those that may have come from beneath it. And I make this point that at the end of my days, I want to be like this tree just slowly dissolving into the earth, having done the best job I could of being purposeful. I feel better. My suffering is eased when I can lean into that, which then makes me able to be present for the other person, whether it's a coaching client, whether it's a podcast conversation, whether it's just going for a walk with one of my children. I just feel better, and I think I am a better person when I think about things like that. So far be it from me to disagree with Mike Tyson, but I think he's wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):
Good callback. It sounds like The Giving Tree to me.

Jerry Colonna (00:55:38):
Oh, yes, yes. Shel Silverstein.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):
To give people something to do with this area of legacy. How did you approach coming up with figuring out what you wanted your legacy to be? Are there some questions you asked? Is there something you recommend folks do to help think through this for themselves?

Jerry Colonna (00:55:57):
Well, it's delightful that we've ended up here because I think that I'm still working through those questions. As I said before as we both connected with, I use my writing to find my way to answers to questions. So part of what I'm dealing with right now is, look, I'll turn 62 this year. That feels old, but it also feels settled. And part of what I'm trying to figure out is what do I want my elderhood to be like? And I'll be honest, I'm enjoying this time of my life where I'm finding myself being a voice of comfort, being a voice of maybe even sanity in a time where that feels really insane and challenging. So maybe that's what my legacy will be. I'm not 100% sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:03):
Is this maybe hinted the new book you're working on? Is this the topic you're thinking about or is this not?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:09):
Yeah, and other things. That's right. That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:15):
Speaking of the world being very crazy right now, you talked about your kids, AI is very top of mind for a lot of people in particular. It's stressing a lot of people out. In a lot of ways, it's quite unsettling in future careers, in skills, people-

Jerry Colonna (00:57:29):
It is unsettling, isn't it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
Quite unsettling, but there's a world where we don't need humans in the future, potentially. Just what advice do you share with clients to help them work through this period of worry with the future, with AI being the core of it?

Jerry Colonna (00:57:45):
Well, if we go back to the equation for a moment, I think it's really important that we actually talk about these things. I would say a year ago, I likened it to the experience that I had. Remember, I'm old enough to remember when not everything had an IP address. Now, our refrigerators have IP addresses. I mean, it's freaking crazy. I'm old enough to remember when you had to install an IP stack into your personal computer in order to connect to the web. That's how old I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:22):
Did you have the phone modem where you had to put the phone?

Jerry Colonna (00:58:26):
Absolutely. Absolutely. It was a big, big deal to go from 1,200 baud to 2,400 baud to 56K. Oh my God, it was like a rocket ship. A year ago, I thought we were going through a similar kind of transition. We're clearly not. This is different. And in the coaching therapeutic world, everybody's like, "Oh my God, ChatGPT is going to replace me." And I don't know, maybe. What I am finding is... I wear glasses. So for those of you who are only listening to the audio, you may find that news. What I am finding is in my own life, it's like I have put on a pair of glasses that are really, really sharp and helpful, and it is disturbing and unsettling because I think it does challenge this question of what is our role as human beings?

(00:59:46):
Now, what I come back to, and I could be wrong, but what I come back to is we're talking through a medium, a mediated experience. My signal is bouncing up into the sky and to a satellite. I won't name the company, it's coming back down. I don't know what your access is. We're using this platform or a site to record this, but somehow we're still finding the capacity to be present for one another in a heart-to-heart way.

(01:00:30):
And so, when I look at these phenomena, what I lift up is that. What I am hopeful about is that that which does not matter in the experience of being human gets burned away and is taken care of, call it by AI, but that that which matters, which is presence and connection, human-to-human contact, strategic thinking, formulation, you want to talk about it in terms of engineering, the conceptualization, that that gets elevated and our skills get better at doing that. And in the most optimistic point of view, what ends up happening is we spend more time on that which matters, and less time on that which doesn't matter. And I could be completely wrong and we could all be out of work and making sure that the robots are well-oiled, and that becomes our purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:47):
Along these lines of glasses and even coaching, the world of coaching, there's a really interesting use case I saw today that Dan Shipper shared that I think you'd love, which is now that ChatGPT has memory, remembers everything you've said, and you can think back, you can ask it, "What are blank spots in the way I see the world that I'm not seeing?" You could also upload all your chat transcripts from your meetings and ask it what could you do better in meetings?

Jerry Colonna (01:02:14):
Look, one of my colleagues in the coaching company, he has uploaded, he kept all of his journal entries, I think over 10 years journal entries from Evernote, and he uploaded that. I think he uses Claude, and he's asked Claude to highlight things. What am I not saying that I need to say? What am I saying that's not being heard? He's asked it to reflect back, and I think it's been incredibly helpful for him. I think the result is that he is a better coach, which is interesting, because the feeling is, well, does this replace it? I am finding, I'm using ChatGPT really as a writing and thinking partner in a way that I did not have before, and I'm still using my live real human writing buddies, which are really important to me. Where does this all end up? I had no idea. It is unsettling, it's uncanny, and it's also enlivening and exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:31):
Well put. I love that you can ask these hard questions of Claude/ChatGPT, these questions that make you really scared could ask it what are the answers, and even not have to do the hard work and maybe get a better answer. I doubt that that will give you the best answers.

Jerry Colonna (01:03:47):
Well, what it might do, which I think would be wonderful, is it might give you more questions to ask yourself. I'm a huge fan of powerful questions and the answer I give to a question like what am I not saying that I need to say? That question, you can ask yourself that question every single day. The question of how have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want? You can ask yourself that question every single day. To take a step back, the subtitle of my first book is Leadership in the Art of Growing Up. The Art of Growing Up is a practice. It's not a scientific moment where one day you wake up and you're done. It's an ongoing practice of not continuous improvement, but continuous inquiry that can feel exhausting when you contemplate it, but enlivening when you live it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):
All this, some people may think of as this whole idea of growth mindset. I know that you're not a big fan of this term, that it's used in a harmful way a lot of times. Can you just talk about that why you find that growth mindset as a concept isn't necessarily useful?

Jerry Colonna (01:05:18):
Here's what I have a problem with. First of all, having a growth mindset is a very, very helpful thing. What I have a problem is in having and how we can turn a notion like a growth mindset into a fixed mindset, which is, it's this funny little trick the ego does, and the ego says, "Okay, well, this is a growth mindset. Oh, this is not a growth mindset. Okay, then this is good. This is not good. This is bad. This is..." What Buddhism has taught me is that everything's falling apart all the time even our growth mindset. When we get too fixed on the proper way to do things, we're setting ourselves up for attachment and therefore suffering. So if you can hold something like a mindset loosely with that attachment, go for it. Have a blast. Enjoy it. But the minute you start to nail it down to the floor and say this is the way it ought to be, I ought to always have a growth mindset, you've become fixed. And that's what the ego does.

(01:06:48):
To be more explicit about it from a business context for example, the great business writer Peter Senge says, "It is virtually impossible to challenge the assumptions that made you rich in the first place." So think about it in our experience of starting a business. We have what the Zen Buddhist would say, beginner's mind, all things are possible. And then, we experience, you were talking about it a little before, a little bit of success, and the ego, which is so terrified of not having success, start to say, "Aha, this is the way to do it." And then, we start to deviate from that because life happens and then the anxiety starts. So the question is, how do you hold a growth mindset loosely knowing that you ought to stay present to the world as it is, respond to the changing dynamics, figure out what's next because that's the growth. So put succinctly, stay attached to the growth and hold mindset a little loosely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:07):
I love that. It reminds me of advice. I did a meditation retreat once, and there's always a sense with Buddhism, and it's interesting how often Buddhism and advice from Buddhist teachings comes up on this podcast by the way.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:18):
When the student is ready, the teacher will appear. You are inviting it in, but keep going.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:25):
That makes sense as you say that. Interesting. So there's this fear I think people have with Buddhist teachings that you will not be as ambitious and you will not achieve as much if you're not attaching.

Jerry Colonna (01:08:41):
If you're not anxiously chasing something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):
Yeah, exactly. If you're just like, "Why do I need that? I don't need to be the CEO of the VP because like, oh, I won't attach to that." And then, so people fear that downside. So I asked this question at this retreat and the advice they shared there was don't attach to this idea, but just point your cart in that direction and head there.

Jerry Colonna (01:09:02):
Yeah, I like that. Look, the fear you're talking about is the fear of complacency. And if we look at the structures of the mind and we look at our socialization, the way we're socialized to ward off complacency is anxiety. And so, if we go back to some of the things we were saying before, if I grow up believing that the way I'm going to make my parents love me is by achieving, then if I become complacent, then what's at risk is their love for me. So just like we made the connection before where unconditional love exists, unconditional positive regard for self, otherwise known as self-compassion can be a powerful motivator, especially when you get to the point where you say, "As painful as it is for me to write, I enjoy writing. I enjoy working out. I enjoy pushing myself. I don't necessarily enjoy it in the moment." But I certainly, when I look at two books on my desk and I say, "You know what? That feels good. That makes me happy."

(01:10:43):
To me, the ability to hold the seeming contradiction of those things is a hallmark of my adulthood. It's to get satisfaction out of hard work for me is a much greater motivator than fear of complacency. As I've sort of slip-slided my way into that place, I have found... I work seven days a week. I don't have to, but I enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):
There's another, maybe a last area I want to spend some time on, which is around teams and what often causes trouble for teams. What breaks teams? What breaks companies? You have this point, you make that it's rarely lack of talent on the team, lack of strategy, lack of execution, that it's something else. What is that something else? What often do you find as the source of the problem for teams that aren't working?

Jerry Colonna (01:11:56):
Well, it's the unresolved, I'll be dramatic with the language, demons from their childhood. It's the unsorted baggage. Here's what happens. Teams are groups, and there are group dynamics that always happen. There is the scapegoat, there is the truth-teller who has to say, "Let me tell you what's really wrong with everything going on." Without the individual's radical self-inquiry skills, groups tend to be condemned to repeating patterns oftentimes of their family of origin.

(01:12:40):
I'll tell you a quick story. There's a very famous software blogger, blogger-owned software that I coached for many years, and we were doing an executive team meeting, and something happened in the group as we were talking that I observed once, twice, and three times, and finally, I said, "Okay, guys, I'm seeing something happen here. Every time we get close to talking about something that's really painful, somebody makes a joke and all the energy disappears and everybody laughs and everybody's nice." And as soon as I said it, my client who was CEO at the time said, "Jesus Christ, that's just like my family." It was like, yes, that's just like your family.

(01:13:35):
Carl Jung once said, "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." Let's apply it here. Until you make conscious the unconscious patterns operating in the group, the group will continue to repeat those patterns and you will blame somebody in the group. Romantic relationships from a Buddhist perspective, part of what we do in romantic relationships is we find the perfect foil for us to work out our unconscious phenomena. When we join a group, when we form up in teams and organizations, we are unconsciously finding the perfect foils for us to work out our own shit. So if you want to create a high-functioning team, do your work, and it starts with the person who has the most power in the group. If that person refuses to do their work, the entire group will become a manifestation of early dysfunction in the individual's lives. Does that make any sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:59):
100%. And this comes up a number of times on this podcast, just the impact the leaders issues have on the rest of the team, and also just this idea that the conditions they're trying to avoid are the conditions they invite in because they're avoiding.

Jerry Colonna (01:15:14):
That's it. That's it. One of my favorite teachers and dear friends is Parker Palmer, and he builds on, I think it was Socrates who said, "The unexamined life is not worth living." And he builds on that and makes a joke, and he says, "But if you choose to live an unexamined life, please don't take a job that involves other people." And that's it. You have a responsibility to examine your own shit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):
So say you're on this team, so there's two sides of this. You're on a team, the leaders clearly got some stuff that they need to work through, but they're not. Is there something you can do there other than just, "Hey, please, this is hurting us?" And then from the leader's perspective listening to this, what should they do? Is it get a coach? What can you do?

Jerry Colonna (01:16:01):
So for the one who has less power?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:04):
Yeah.

Jerry Colonna (01:16:05):
One of the things to ask oneself is what draws me to this position in the first place? How have I been complicit, not responsible in creating the conditions I say I don't want. How have I benefited from the dysfunction that exists in this organization? And benefit is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean I'm making more money. It means, for example, a benefit might be, boy, this feels familiar. I always find myself working on teams that are dysfunctional in this way. What is there in that experience for me to learn? So that's one thing.

(01:16:55):
You asked about the person who has power. You were using the word leader. I will talk about power, and you threw out, well, should they get a coach? Let's put it into larger context. Should you examine your life with radical self-inquiry? Yes. I would argue that the more power you have, the more moral responsibility you have to actually pause and figure out what it is that you're doing to be complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want.

(01:17:28):
To be a very quick example what I'm talking about. A couple of years ago, I was doing a talk at a venture firm's CEO portfolio summit, the portfolio company's CEO summit. And we're sitting in a room, and of course I'm walking around again with shoes off and whatever, and people are firing questions at me. And one woman says, "Well, I'm the CEO of this 15-person company, and I have a question for you. Why is it that nobody on my team can make a decision without me?" And I said, "Who hired them?" And she, "Well..." I said, "Okay, how does it make you feel when they make a decision that you disagree with?" She said, "I'm furious." "Well, how can you hire people whom you expect to make decisions without running them through you if you can't tolerate them making a decision that you disagree with?"

(01:18:37):
You want to build a scaled leadership team, you have to be willing to have them make boneheaded decisions. And that's really, really hard, especially if we're "in founder mode" driving all the decisions. So that's your growth edge. We were talking about before about growth mindset. That's your growth edge. How can I be with the people in my life making boneheaded decisions about something that I care so much about and what is the best way for me to be in relationship about that?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
So much of this comes back to that question we started this with of just how are you complicit in creating the conditions you don't want? A big takeaway for me here, and it just keeps coming up and again and again, is if you're struggling as a leader, if your company's not working as well as you wanted to, if you're having a hard time with your team, going back to that equation, it's not about building more skills like public speaking skills or email skills, or I don't know, financial skills. It's self-awareness, radical self-inquiry, understanding what drives you, what makes you happy. Is that generally correct?

Jerry Colonna (01:19:51):
Lenny, I was just going to say, you just made me so happy you saying what you just said. Yes. I've been coaching now, as I said for a couple of decades. Before that, I was a VC for 15, 17 years. What you just said is the wisdom of my 40 years as an adult. That's it. This is why radical self-inquiry is so damned important because it leads to a little bit less suffering and a lot more resilience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):
For folks that want to actually do that, well, they can rewind back to the middle of the episode where we actually ask the questions that are associated with the radical self-inquiry, and then obviously if they want to dig deeper, they can buy your book.

Jerry Colonna (01:20:41):
Or 10 copies of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):
Or 100 copies for everyone at the company willing to Amazon. Jerry, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think is really important for people to hear maybe as the last piece of wisdom?

Jerry Colonna (01:20:57):
Now one of the hopes that I have you ask me at the start like what would be my hope is that we ended up being closer and friends, and I feel that. Let me extend that out to everybody. What I always hope from all of these intimate conversations that I try to do in podcasts is that people walk away going, "Geez, I'm not alone." We've made different references to the fact that it's a hard time. The truth is it's always a hard time. And what makes it hardest is to feel like I'm the only one who's going through this. So what I appreciate about what you do, Lenny, is that under the guise of talking about product, you're really talking about the process of being human. And that is a mitzvah. That's a good deed. And so, I hope in the process of listening to this, people walk away going, "Okay, I feel a little bit better today."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:04):
I really appreciate that. The way I think about these sorts of conversations and episodes, I call them Trojan Horse episodes where people come for the other stuff, tactical, practical stuff, and then they get stuff they really need to hear. And so, I appreciate you. Jerry, thank you so much for being here.

Jerry Colonna (01:22:19):
Thank you for having me. It was a delight.

# How to see like a designer: The hidden power of typography and logos | Jessica Hische

## Transcript

Jessica Hische (00:00:00):
Most people are better at understanding the feelings and sensations that typography and logos give us than they give themselves credit for, because what we are as people are endless absorbers of patterns, and information, and all this kind of stuff as we move throughout the world. We don't take time to sit and digest it, but it's still coming in and getting logged, and so even as a non-designer, I think you can look at examples of logos where something's not quite right and be like, "Something's not right here, I just don't know how to name it." But I think a good exercise is just like looking at fonts that are available in the world and asking yourself, "What feeling does this give me?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):
Today, my guest is Jessica Hische. Jessica is a design legend, and it was such an honor to both have her on this podcast and also to work with her on a refresh of my newsletter and podcast logo and brand, which is launching around the same time as this episode comes out. Jessica is a lettering artist specializing in typographical work for logos, film, books, and other commercial applications. Her clients include Wes Anderson, the United States Postal Service, Apple, Nike, Tiffany and Company, The Gap, and Penguin Books, and her work has been featured in design and illustration annals, both in the U.S. and internationally. She's helped create logos for Philz Coffee, Eventbrite, and Mailchimp, is a best-selling children's book author, and if you live around the Bay Area, you've seen her work all over the city without knowing it. In our conversation, Jessica shares the process that she went through to update my logo and brand for my newsletter and podcast.

(00:01:38):
What specific elements of a logo and brand impact how you feel about that brand, why a good enough logo is just buying for a long time for most startups, and when it makes sense to refresh your look, also some really clever productivity tips, design advice, and a bunch of really fun stories. Jessica is a master at what she does and I am excited to spread the Jessica Hische gospel. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jessica Hische. Jessica, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Jessica Hische (00:02:19):
Happy to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):
I thought it'd be good to start with asking you just to describe what it is you do, because you're very atypical of the kinds of guests I have in this podcast and you also have very unique skillset.

Jessica Hische (00:02:32):
Yes. Well, I will describe what I'm most prominently known for, because I'm a person who just does a lot of things, but the thing that I do the most professionally is custom typography, like bespoke lettering pieces. That translates to working for all kinds of things. Sometimes it's for film and television. I've done movie titles and things like that and television credits and stuff. Sometimes it's book covers. Actually, a lot of times, it's book covers, and then a big part of my business is doing logos, and logo refreshes, and things like that, so basically being the person who knows all the things so you don't have to have that person on staff when it comes to typography.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:17):
This episode is brought to you by the Enterprise Ready Conference, a one-day event in San Francisco bringing together product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS. The event features a curated list of speakers with direct experience building for the enterprise, including leaders from OpenAI, Vanta, Checkr, Dropbox, and Canva. Topics include advanced identity management, compliance, encryption, and logging, essentially at complex features that most enterprise customers require. If you're a founder, exec, product manager, or engineer tasked with the enterprise roadmap, this conference is for you. You'll get detailed insights from industry leaders that have years of experience navigating the same challenges that you face today. Best of all, it's completely free. Since it's hosted by WorkOS. Spots are filling up quickly, make sure to request an invite at enterpriseready.com. That's enterpriseready.com. I am excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:04:21):
Yes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:23):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:04:39):
Yes. We just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:01):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina Gilbert (00:05:12):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multiday outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:32):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:05:47):
Part of the reason I was excited to have you on this podcast is that I was lucky enough to get to work with you on a refresh of my logo and brand for my newsletter and my podcast, which I'm very, very excited about. It's actually going to be launching right around the time of this episode going live, so this is, in part, a celebration of the new look, and logo, and brand. I thought it'd be an awesome excuse to bring you on the podcast and give an inside glimpse into the process of updating a logo and a brand. Partly, because I think it'll just be people are like, "What the hell? How did this change? Where did this come from? Why this versus that?" and also just for people that are thinking about this for their own product or business, to understand the process and understand when it might be right for them, when it might be not right for them. Broadly, how does that sound?

Jessica Hische (00:06:32):
Sure. Yeah, of course. Everybody that starts a company knows that they need a logo. That is a big thing. Some people start a company and think the logo is going to drive the culture of the company, which I don't think that that is true. I think that the product itself, and the team you build, and the people you put together are the thing that should be driving things forward, but I do think the logo and the brand assets can generate a lot of both internal and external excitement and just tell people what to expect from the thing that they're about to engage with. Some people say don't judge a book by its cover. I'm the opposite, where any book... The cover of the book should be giving you incredible insight into what is on the interior of the book and setting the tone and setting the vibe so that when you open the book and read the book, it's a symbiotic thing where you're like, "Oh, I understand what I was getting into. This got me excited about starting it," and whatever. It keeps that ball rolling.

(00:07:34):
But with the refresh work that I do, a lot of people start companies and they have a certain amount of money. If they're bootstrapping it, they have less. If they get venture money, they have a little bit more. But what they don't want to do is spend venture money on a massive brand exploration when you're still in the hiring process, you're still trying to get early stage engineers, and all that kind of stuff, and so I am sort of a weird contrarian in this way in the brand world where brand people are like, "Brand is everything. You need to take a significant investment in brand because that guides the vision of the product or whatever." But I think being a bit more of an insider within the tech world, I understand that sometimes people start companies and have an intention to do something.

(00:08:24):
While they're doing that, they're building the team, they're doing cool stuff, but then the company has to pivot for one reason or another, whether a competitor immediately comes out with a thing that you're doing or the technology that you're doing gets postponed, whatever's going to feed into it, and so if you invest super heavily on the whole brand vision from the jump, sometimes it's like throwing away money if you have to pivot. What I love about the work that I do is that I understand that a lot of people have to just have something to put on decks and have something to put on a holding page or whatever, and internal teams are totally capable of doing that early work. But then if it does become successful, you don't want to get locked into whatever it is that you had to throw together before an investor meeting or something.

(00:09:15):
I come in then to take the existing vibe and smooth it out, address any of the concerns that came up. A lot of times, it's really utilitarian stuff like this doesn't scale well, or this thing falls apart in this context, or we never had a good avatar version of it, or whatever. Sometimes it's really specific utilitarian fixes, and sometimes it's just about growing it up and sophisticated it without losing what was there in the first place that people got excited about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):
To give people maybe a couple more tactical piece of advice here, what's a sign that it's maybe time to do something with your logo and brand from you took a first pass, it's good enough, your wife made one, your husband made you a logo, it's like, "Well, this is great. Let's just go with this"? What's a sign that maybe it's time to, "Okay, we should actually at least uplevel this, not necessarily hire studio but takes something to make it better"?

Jessica Hische (00:10:10):
Well, one of the things is if, suddenly, you're starting to deal with the greater rollout of the look and feel of the brand. If you, at first, just basically had a really beta website and small version of the app but you're about to do a new one that kind of updates and expands it, that could be a really good time to roll it out. One of the things that a lot of people do when they're starting a company is that they'll make a logo with a font that is really popular or widely available or free. If you are about to, let's say, print a bunch of swag for new hires, or you're hosting a conference, or whatever is that event where suddenly you're going to physically invest money in making stuff with your brand on it, that might be a good time to do it.

(00:11:03):
One of the reasons why I tell people why having a custom logo or custom typography can really matter is that if you're using something that's available to everyone, the chances of someone else coming in and copying you are very easy and high. You might be one of these lucky companies that just out the gate is outrageously successful, but with success comes people climbing up behind you trying to copy your success. If that success is very easily copyable and people will try to trick your customers into coming their way by repeating the things that you're doing, including the branding, one way to avoid that is by doing something that's more customized when it comes to the logo and brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:47):
Let's actually talk about the work that you put into updating my logo and brand. From that, we can spin off into lessons and insights that you have along these lines. Overall, just high level, what's the process you go through to go through a logo refresh?

Jessica Hische (00:12:01):
Sure, of course. Super high level, it's figuring out what the goals are. Some people have a goal where they want their customers to not notice it at all. They're like, "Oh, everybody loves this, but I, the person with a design eye, can see all the problems with it. I need to roll something out that fixes the problems that I see but that no one else really notices." If that's one approach to it, which is a very close in refresh where we're just trying out little things to make it feel custom or fixing things that have come up when stress-tested, whether it looks crazy when you scale it and looks like horsey and heavy-handed when you scale it too big or when you scale it too small, you lose a lot of legibility and stuff like that. That's what would be a really close in exploration.

(00:12:53):
For other people, they might have bigger goals where they're about to pivot the company to try to attract a different audience or things like that. They might have this really cool and successful group of people that are super users but they're trying to expand it, so then it's about, "What can we do to shift the vibe to make it include these new people without excluding our core folks?" My first round is figuring out what that scope is, how experimental, how broad are we going to go for that first round, because then everything else cascades from there. If we go really broad for the first round, then we're in this process of narrowing down the scope as we go down. Whereas if we go really close in for the first round, we're already just talking about really technical stuff.

(00:13:45):
This is another thing that is a little bit unique to me that not everybody else does, but I will hand off files to clients to try in situ really early on if what we're trying to do is solve utilitarian issues. Most other people are like, "No, you don't get the files until we do the final because I don't want you to run away with this or whatever." There has to be some trust with it. Yeah, figure out what we're trying to accomplish and always keep those goals in mind, and then scope out the process based on what those goals are. For each round, we're addressing different things. First round might be about just capturing the overall look and trying things as broad as we can, and then the next round is, "Okay. Well, now we have generally a look that we want, but is it the right weight? Is it the right letter height? Do we have enough details?" That kind of thing, and then we get narrower and nerdier as we go along in the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:45):
Awesome. In the experience of my podcast logo, I was an ass. At the end of it, I'm like, "No, this isn't right," because we narrowed, narrowed, narrowed, and then I was like, "No, I'm not feeling it," and then we unnarrowed it and went back. [inaudible 00:15:02]

Jessica Hische (00:15:01):
That is not an uncommon experience though. This is why there's a few things that I'm not opposed to that I know people that are very opposed to. I'm not opposed to Frankensteining options together. To me, it's like I'm giving you a menu of all the things that we can do, but I'm like a chef that puts a menu together where you can combine different appetizers and different mains and they all still make sense. Some people will give you a menu and if you try to do that, it's insane and it tastes terrible. But for me, everything that we're doing, I feel like, mixes and matches fairly well, and I will let you know if it doesn't.

(00:15:37):
It's not unreasonable for clients to go down one path and then use that as validation or confirmation that something that we did much earlier was actually the right way. In that way, if a client ever asks me to do something, they're like, "Let's see it in purple or whatever." There's designers that will really fight you tooth and nail, because they're like, "That is wrong, that is wrong," but I know that some people just have to see it before they can let it go. Sometimes you have to walk down a path before you're able to understand what the right thing to do was all along.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):
That's exactly how it felt for me. Going back to the goals, the different goals people have when they're exploring this, you mentioned there's just little problems with the logo, it doesn't scale, it doesn't print well, that kind of thing. Another goal is people are pivoting and they want to change the vibe and the feel of the brand. What other goals might appear that you've come across why people want to do this?

Jessica Hische (00:16:31):
Well, sometimes there's a legibility issue that is really glaring once you see it and then people are too close in to notice it, so this is why it's like you have to show it to a lot of people that aren't familiar with looking at those letter forms and stuff. The one that came to mind immediately when you asked was when I did a refresh for Jeni's Ice Cream, which is a really amazing ice cream brand based out of Columbus, Ohio. They had a few utilitarian things in mind. They had this long J that created this pocket of white space underneath it that made it really hard to design with, but then the biggest glaring one was that they decided to make the apostrophe of the Jeni's over the I as a cool thing. It made the word look like it said penis because of the way that J was drawn.

(00:17:18):
It had a little loop at the top of the J. That was the most specific fix that I've ever had to do, is make the logo not say penis anymore. But yeah, I feel like a lot of it is misreads. When you think about logos and things like that, you want it to be something that, at a super fast glance, people can read it right away. That doesn't mean that everything has to be simple, but it just means that everything has to be incredibly legible, especially when you're starting a new company or you have a less recognizable brand. Because eventually, you become a household name and then people can look at just the color and recognize that it's you or whatever, but it takes a long time building equity before you get that. Until that, it's really important that the legibility is just super tight.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:04):
Let's talk about actually thinking through my new logo and brand. Can you just talk about what you had in mind as you started to explore directions and we started narrowing what was the mindset, and the approach, and the vibe?

Jessica Hische (00:18:18):
I think with the Lenny's brand, you are what I would call a person that has a beloved fan base that we don't want to exclude or offend by shifting gears super crazily. When I was looking at redoing your brand, it was about what's here that we can look at that we should keep or at least explore keeping in order to make sure that it still feels the same on the other side? We didn't want to do anything super drastic. Some of the things to think about in that way are you have this sort of handwritten approach to a lot of the parts of your brand, and I was like, "How do we do something that feels handwritten, that feels like it could jive with the handwriting scripts and stuff that you were using but might feel a little bit more refined moving forward and in a way that could blend with illustration so that the illustration and the letter forms all feel like they were created by the same hand?"

(00:19:17):
A lot of times for me, when it comes to doing an exploration like that, it's about how do we make sure everything feels like it was created at the same time and not that we just tacked on new things? Figuring out how to blend everything together is important. Color was also a big one. I feel like people's color stories are something that is an immediate read, where if you blur your eyes and look at a brand, you can recognize it by its color, and so I think keeping your color similar was a big one too. But then I really wanted to try different approaches with the typography, doing stuff that was a little bit more clean, doing stuff that still had a bit of a funky edge to it. Because your original Lenny's podcast type had this sort of cut papery, a little bit off kilter vibe to it, and so trying to capture that but with new cleaner typography. That was really fun.

(00:20:13):
I was using a typeface Degular as part of it, which has a nice wonkiness to it. It was drawn by a friend of mine, James Edmondson, who I love all of his stuff. That was one of the things that we approached because I felt like it could capture the look of the original cut paperesque type. But yeah, it was really fun to try a lot of different things and work within the iconography that you had used on a few stuff with the microphones, and also marshmallows, and campfires, and all kinds of things, and just trying to make a more unified system.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:47):
Are there things that didn't work as you tried to explore this process that you recall, that might be worth sharing of just like, "Oh, that was a cool concept," but didn't quite work the way you thought?

Jessica Hische (00:20:57):
With working on this refresh, so much of it was thinking about what are the immediate uses of the logo. Your logo, you have these very specific uses that you need it for, the avatar for the podcast being a top one. Some people, they'll design a logo and then have these illustrative versions of the logo that get rolled out for other things, but I feel like those layouts were actually more important than even just having a basic letterhead-esque logo. That's an interesting way to approach it, because usually, it's like let's start simple, and expand, and make it crazier. I felt like we had to always keep those things in play, so it was designing brand assets while also designing the logo. Sometimes you'll see examples of that in early explorations just because it makes it feel real to the client.

(00:21:53):
That's why there's always the tote bag. You got to put the logo on the tote bag and then it feels real or whatever. But in our case, we had really specific uses that needed to get explored very early on, and that made it a slightly different process for me. In terms of things that didn't work though, I think just trying to work on the level of detail within the illustration and type so that it could shrink down, because we knew... One of the primo examples of the logo being used was on that podcast avatar, and some of the versions felt a little bit too detailed to shrink down that much. Trying to get the balance of that, having the illustrations feel illustrative and whole, but not when they scaled up, to feel too simple like we just pulled it from a icon library. I think that was an interesting challenge.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):
One of the impetuses for changing my logo, for motivating me, is my wife's a designer, as you know. She's got strong opinions about my logo, and she always was making fun of my logo saying it looked like a clip art fireplace that anyone just could just plug and play. She's always like, "Oh, that's so bad. You got to change it." That was one of the motivators. I think I might have shared that when we started working together.

Jessica Hische (00:23:08):
Yeah. Also too, I think that really talks to what I was saying earlier about making sure that everything feels like it was created together rather than it feeling like these disparate elements, because I think you can have an icon or logo that is quite simple as long as the rest of the brand matches that simplicity. I think, for you, the biggest thing was making the illustration and the typography just feel like it came from the same universe instead of feeling like these separate elements. When I first moved to San Francisco, I moved to San Francisco from New York, and as a New Yorker, I had an apartment with a full kitchen that never got used. I just ate at restaurants and did takeout for the seven years or whatever that I lived in New York.

(00:23:51):
Learning to cook, at first, when you learn how to cook, it's like you're making a pot full of ingredients and none of the ingredients are actually working together. But then the more you do it and the more you understand how these things are meant to blend and cook at different temperatures at different times, you start having this cohesive dish rather than hot ham water. You know what I mean? I feel like a lot of clients come to me and they have hot ham water when it comes to their brand. It's just about turning that into a soup, something that feels real.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:25):
I want to take a quick tangent. Most people listening to this podcast are not designers. They're product managers, founders, engineers, and folks building product. I've always wanted to see the world through the eyes of a designer, because there's so much I don't see and there's so much that affects how I think about something that I don't understand when I look at a logo, and so I thought it might be helpful just to spend a little time helping people see a designer a little bit. Let me just ask you this question. When people look at a logo or a brand, what are just elements that make it what it is, that make you feel the thing you want to feel that we may not recognize?

Jessica Hische (00:25:06):
I think most people are better at understanding the feelings and sensations that typography and logos give us than they give themselves credit for, because what we are as people are endless absorbers of patterns, and information, and all this kind of stuff as we move throughout the world. We don't take time to sit and digest it, but it's still coming in and getting logged. That's why if you see something funky in the world, you're like, "That's weird. I don't like that. I don't know why I don't like it, but I know I don't like it." I think even as a non-designer, you can see that in typography. The whole being able to recognize patterns thing, I talked about this a bit at config, it's like it's a safety thing. Looking into the world, your eyes can spot that thing that's a little bit off, and that thing that's off feels not safe to you.

(00:26:08):
It's thinking about when we look at a meal and there's a thing on the plate that looks like it's moldy or something like that. You understand that doesn't look right to me, this doesn't smell right to me. Your body knows it before your brain knows it. Even as a non-designer, I think you can look at examples of logos where something's not quite right and be like, "Something's not right here, I just don't know how to name it." But I think a good exercise is just looking at fonts that are available in the world and asking yourself, "What feeling does this give me?" and just write them down. It doesn't matter, just give yourself permission to say whatever is happening in your mind, the first thing. Don't overanalyze it. Just look at it and be like, "That feels calm to me. That feels exciting to me. That feels whatever to me."

(00:27:00):
The more you do that, the more you can start seeing similarities in the ones that feel exciting, and the ones that feel calm, and the ones that feel whatever, and then get into analyze mode of, "Oh, these 10 things that I said feel calm are a lighter weight, have more generous spacing, have rounded edges, have rounder bowls to the letter forms." You just start seeing commonalities between the things. It's just about seeing them all together to understand what those similarities are. I think anybody can do that. I mean, you're not going to have the language of the leg of the R and the tittle of the I. Don't worry about that. You don't have to know typography language to think about it, but anybody's capable of doing that. It can be really fun to just stop and ask yourself and notice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):
This is great. I want to go actually a little deeper. What I'm hearing is look at something, tap into the feeling you feel when you look at it, actually pay attention to it because there's wisdom in that. The specific things that you pointed out that impact that feeling are, you mentioned, spacing between the letters, the edges. I imagine there's just the color of it. What other specific elements impact the way someone feels when they look at a logo?

Jessica Hische (00:28:26):
There's the width of the letter, so if it's really narrow versus really wide. I always think about the width, the weight, [inaudible 00:28:35] facing, sort of detailed treatment of things, whether things are very hard and jagged or soft and how soft it is. Sometimes we just add a tiny bit of softness so that it just feels printed. You can take a typeface like Helvetica, just the one everybody knows. But if you take Helvetica and just ever so slightly round the edges just a little bit, all of a sudden, you have this typeface that feels more vintage, or softer, or whatever, because we're perceiving it, we would perceive it if it were printed on paper versus perceiving it as this hard geometric piece of technology that we're viewing. You know what I mean?

(00:29:20):
I know that it's because when you look at stuff printed on a page, it bleeds into the paper a little bit, which means that that softness reminds us in our bodies of a thing that we've seen that was printed. It's cool to sort of walk back your feelings also. You'll look at something and go, "That feels like this," and then ask yourself why does it feel like that. It might be because you saw it on a flyer for a band when you were 22, and it brought out that feeling in you of what it felt like to be 22 at that thing. That's a very specific feeling to you, but it can inform your decisions about design, because you can be like, "Oh, I'm not that much of a special snowflake." Other people might have that same reaction but have different experiences that are adjacent to that reaction.

(00:30:08):
It's cool because you are reverse-justifying decisions. I think that's a really fun exercise to do, is to Song Exploder your intuition. You make a decision intuitively or look at something and intuit what you feel from it, and then really try to dive in, "Why do I feel that way? What could this have reminded me of that made me feel that way?" You have to be just so forgiving and loose with yourself as you do it because then you'll get into some really weird stuff, and that's really great inspiration juice for picking other things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:51):
I love the exercise that you gave. The one you gave earlier is look at a bunch of fonts, look at your font folder. Is that a place to go, just open up your font folder and just go through them?

Jessica Hische (00:30:55):
Totally. Look at your font folder, or go to MyFonts, or a place where there's a ton of fonts, and just search for something. Search for sans serif or whatever. Search for a really basic category of fonts. Serif, sans serif, script, whatever, the top level edge of stuff, and then just page through, page through, page through. Screenshot stuff that you like and make a folder full of screenshots, and then you can take those screenshots and start categorizing them. "Oh, this one feels feminine. This one feels masculine, this one feels aggressive. This one feels whatever." Just take some notes on it. Then, you ask yourself, "Well, why did I feel that way?" You're like, "Oh, well, this feels feminine because it reminds me of wedding invitations," and wedding invitations feel inherently bridey versus groomy. All of a sudden, you're like, "Okay. Well, now I know that if I'm going to use a script for something, this zone of script feels very wedding, so maybe I avoid that for this brand that's actually a cutting edge food packaging company or whatever because it feels too aligned with that industry."

(00:32:10):
Stereotypes are real and trends are real, and what can sometimes happen is some industry usurps an entire style for a period of time. If you use anything within that style, it's like you're aligning yourself to that industry. I mean, everybody that does branding, one of the things that they do is they analyze the competitors of the company. You just look at a landscape of what are all the competitors doing, what is their visual vibe, and do I lean into that or do I avoid that? If I lean into it, then I'm immediately getting this... Everyone that looks at it understands I'm a FinTech company because I look like a FinTech company. If my whole thing is I'm trying to be divergent from that, I'm trying to show how different I am from the status quo, then you use it as a reactionary thing of I want to do nothing like that and do something really different so people understand this isn't just another FinTech company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:09):
Yeah. I'm thinking green. The color green has to be a part of the logo if you want to be a FinTech company.

Jessica Hische (00:33:13):
Yeah, exactly. If you're trying to be weird, then you're like teal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):
On this topic of seeing a designer, is there any other tip, just before we move on to a different topic, of just how someone could learn to see a designer a little bit more?

Jessica Hische (00:33:30):
Yeah. Another thing to notice, because I'm assuming you're... Product people, I feel like a lot of product people end up having some engineering background, whether or not they're engineers themselves. They have to interface with the engineers and they build stuff, and so they come at it from a data standpoint. I can always tell when there's an engineer that has suddenly got taken an interest in type design and is now a type designer, because everything is very, very regular. You can draw a grid on top of everything and the lines all line up perfectly. You see lots of reverse justification of that when people are making logos and they have a more engineering background. The thing to notice, that is interesting within type, is that, yes, you're absolutely following rules, but you're breaking those rules quite often to correct for optical tricks.

(00:34:24):
If you look at a geometric sans serif, for instance, that's like a category of sans serifs, and they're meant to have a lot of really strong geometry, be very regular, like most of the sans that you think of that you're like, "I'm in love with this over the last 10 years," like geometric sanses. But when you really start to examine them, you notice that there's all these little things that people are doing to make them look perfectly geometric even though they are not mathematically perfectly geometric. That's another thing that you can do, whether you're doing it in Figma or doing it somewhere else, is just type out a couple of lowercase letters. Lowercase specifically are really good for analyzing this because they're smaller than the uppercase letters. You usually have to accommodate for the weight a little bit differently. You'll notice that when strokes combine, so say I have an A and I'm combining the lower bowl of the A, I'm going to get a little thinner as I come into that.

(00:35:23):
Or say I have a two-storey A, so a two-storey A is the one that's like this and then a bowl, you might notice that this vertical of the A there, the bowl actually eats into that stroke a little bit to erase a little bit of that added weight that would've been perceived optically had you kept everything perfectly regular. It's weird because you end up creating something that's perfect and then have to make it not perfect in order to make it be perceived as perfect. That's another just fun thing to start noticing. You notice it a lot more on typefaces and typography that is heavier in weight, because when things are heavier weight, you're constantly managing these really inky moments where things join together and you have to subtract a bunch of weight from that so that it doesn't get perceived as this dark mark where the letter is happening.

(00:36:22):
I think about lowercase Rs and lowercase Ns, where the shoulder of the N or the R comes out, sometimes the top of the R is actually narrower at the top than it is on the bottom, and that's to try to subtract some of that weight in there where that join happens. Anyway, that's just a fun thing to notice that you have to do that. Once you start seeing it, you start seeing where it happens more often, and the answer of why it happens is because correcting for this optical weight issue. You're like, "Oh, man. Now I have x-ray vision. I can see all these weird things I've never seen before." It's very fun. But anyway, a lot of people, when they first start out doing typography, whether you're an engineer or whether you are a designer, they don't account for that. I can always just look at something and see whether someone is truly an expert at typography or whether this is a fun hobby for them when they're pretty fresh at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:20):
The exercise here is open up Figma, start typing, and make it really big so you can basically see the font really zoomed in.

Jessica Hische (00:37:20):
A single letter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):
A single letter.

Jessica Hische (00:37:28):
Make a single letter the whole page and then just draw some vertical lines, or do the thing where you draw a little circle or whatever and see if that circle is the same size at the point where two strokes join together or the point where the stroke is just vertical and on its own. You'll notice that there's differences even in typography that's meant to look extremely rigid and geometric.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:53):
I want to come back to my logo just to close the loop there. Talk about just the final result that we landed on, and why you think that was the final answer, and what you think people might get from it, whatever comes to mind.

Jessica Hische (00:38:07):
Yeah, totally. I think the final answer or the final logo, we took it down a lot of different paths trying to see where it was going to land, but ultimately ended up keeping it pretty close to home and really focusing on that asset of the fire. We tried so many different versions of it's microphones with the fire and marshmallows with the fire, et cetera. It was just about sometimes the simplest solution is the correct solution. I don't know, I just feel like in terms of what we were doing for blowing it out and making it really cohesive, we went a lot of directions where there might've been multiple versions of the logo depending on the scale and ultimately ended up in a place where it's much more in line and consistent across the bar.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:55):
Yeah. Maybe what I'll do is we'll share, I don't know if you're comfortable with that, we could just share all the iterations somewhere that we went through.

Jessica Hische (00:39:01):
Oh, yeah. I love sharing iterations. It's very fun. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):
Okay, cool. Sweet. The biggest issue we had with the podcast logo specifically is, originally, I was thinking the mic made sense to differentiate it from the newsletter. At the end of it, it's just like, "Why do we have this freaking mic in there? It just feels strange." That's where we revisited the whole idea and killed the mic and went back to a different version of the fireplace but with marshmallows.

Jessica Hische (00:39:24):
Yeah, I love the marshmallows.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:26):
Awesome. I love it. That was my wife's... My wife loves the marshmallows also, and it's so versatile. We can use it in so many different ways.

Jessica Hische (00:39:33):
Indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:34):
I guess maybe one last thread there is we explored handwritten typography that you created from scratch, and then there's the block letters. Maybe just thoughts on those two options and benefits and why go one direction versus another?

Jessica Hische (00:39:51):
The handwritten one, I really liked because I felt like we could bring the line quality of the illustration into the handwriting, but then the only problem with the handwriting is that if you want to blow that out, if you want to include other handwriting throughout the rest of the brand, finding something that matches that perfectly without creating a custom typeface is a whole thing. I really like being able to combine the two, where we have this broader visual vocabulary that we can pull from, because you're going to have headlines, you're going to have subheads, you're going to have all these other uses for typography moving forward. If you just have one thing to pull from, it's a lot harder to work with. It's just nicer when you have a few elements to play with. It's like having a wardrobe. If you have only one shirt and one pair of pants, there's only so many things that you can do. But if you have all these things that work together and can recombine, then you can blow out a brand system much more easily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):
Yeah. That's one of my favorite things about working with you, is you create all these different variations of ways to use it. It doesn't always have to be the handwritten one. It could be the blocky outlining one. It's not like, "This is it, don't change anything about this. This is the only way to use it."

Jessica Hische (00:40:57):
Well, part of that is because some brands, if you have a massive company, like hundreds of employees generating hundreds of things, sometimes having too many assets can overcomplicate stuff. Because unless you have a really, really well-written brand book outlining how to do everything that people are adhering to very closely, you can get the assets running rampant throughout all of the stuff and being used incorrectly. But because you're not a massive company and you have creative control over the things that are happening and can help direct that, we can be much more playful with the assets and give you the ability to use things in different ways. It depends on how much you trust all the people that are handling your assets.

(00:41:43):
I am of the mind that you shouldn't need a 500-page brand book in order to direct how the brand is used moving forward, and that if you do, the brand might be quite complicated, or there might be even just parts of the logo that make it difficult to work with. My goal always when designing a logo is to design a logo that's so easy to use that you don't have to be an extremely skilled designer to design well with it. That's my number one goal, because I know not everybody is going to be at a stage where they have an internal brand team or a designer that's a rock star designer that can work with really complicated assets and make them look good.

(00:42:28):
I just want the assets to teach you themselves, by just how they exist, how to use it. You, as a person that has any taste whatsoever, and hopefully people that you're hiring for any job at your company have some degree of taste. If you hire an engineer, they have to have taste about how that happens. If you hire a marketing person, they have to have taste about how that happens. They should be able to look at that and intuit most of the way that you should be able to use it without being explicitly told, "Do not do this."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:01):
This episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorado, and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product, or HRAS data to auto provision and deprovision access for the customer's employees. Yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. Want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all, book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.

(00:44:08):
This is a good circle back to something you touched on earlier that I wanted to come back to, which is a lot of companies, in your opinion, put too much weight on the power of brand, and rebranding, and how much a brand can fix their problems. Can you just again share your perspective on just how this might be an issue for people where they almost overemphasize the power of brand? [inaudible 00:44:32]

Jessica Hische (00:44:31):
Yeah. Well, there's different companies. There's companies where brand is literally everything, where they're doing something that's not crazy innovative in the first place and the brand is the thing that is the whole company, and that's fine. That's a completely valid way to do stuff. It's like people that can take in information and recommunicate it in a way to another audience or whatever that they hit that audience in a way that the original information couldn't do. Think about all of the people who write books on psychology, and medicine, and all kinds of stuff that write it for a broader popular audience. They're the ones reading the medical papers, they're the ones digesting all of this really huge complicated data, and turning it into something that normal people can read. I think that there are companies that are doing that. They're taking a thing that is not innovative or isn't like they're not the only ones doing it, but they're repackaging it in a way that takes that and makes it so accessible to so many people.

(00:45:34):
In that case, brand can matter immensely, where the brand really is the thing that shows people that the thing that you're doing has value. But for a lot of people, the brand should be somewhat invisible so that the thing itself becomes the star. If we think about the experiences that we have using products, sometimes there's products where there's a ton of fun and delight built into how you use it, and that can happen through brand through design choices and things like that. Sometimes the delight is the fact that nothing is getting in your way as you're using that product. You just figure out what's your ethos of your company. Is the whole thing about doing a thing well, doing it simply, and making sure that everything gets out of the way of that experience, or is it like we're trying to generate this delightful thing or we're trying to open it up to a new audience or whatever? Depending on whatever that goal is, brand can have a different place in that equation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:42):
I think some of this unique perspective on the power brand and the need for it in tech companies comes from you're not like a tech person. You work with tech people, you work with tech companies. Do you feel like that has an impact on the way you think and the value that you bring to companies to give them this very outside perspective?

Jessica Hische (00:47:01):
I mean, most of the folks that I know that work in brand or traditional graphic design, print design, they don't necessarily have a lot of insight into how building companies works. They're not friends with a ton of startup founders and things like that. I've just had been in this very fun position being like everyone's token creative person in The Bay for a while, and this been for a long time. I remember speaking at a Silicon Valley event that was women in Silicon Valley in 2009 or 2010, something like that. It's interesting to be a person that has never actually, themselves, worked at a tech company but felt so involved and understanding about how all of that works. My partner, the reason why we're in The Bay is because he got hired by Facebook back in 2011. We were olds at the time. Take that with a grain of salt, don't judge me.

(00:48:02):
Because we were 28, 29 coming over to work at Facebook and everybody there was 23, 24, and so all the people that we ended up meeting in The Bay were more people our age that were moving on to start companies and things like that. We just got to see that perspective so clearly of what it is to branch out on your own, to fundraise, to do all this stuff, to pivot, to do little experimental apps and see where that goes to get acquired as a team versus getting acquired as a technology or whatever. I've been able to see that in a way that I feel like a lot of people that do my job don't get to see. That makes me very sympathetic and towards what it is to want to build a brand as a founder. I understand that you have limited resources and those resources aren't necessarily going to get devoted to doing a $200,000 brand exploration, because when you have $500,000 of money at all for a year to try to get things going, you certainly should not spend half of that money on branding.

(00:49:12):
That's my opinion, but that's not to say that brand can't be important and can't come in at some level or can't be thought of as a partnership between you and someone else where... There's this whole idea of fractional leadership now, which I feel like hasn't really infiltrated my world as much, but I don't know why it hasn't, because most people don't have internal comms teams, internal brand teams, until the company is very mature. The idea that you could bring someone in who is a real expert in whatever it's that they do, just as you need them, and they just get consultant equity kind of thing, that should be more present because people don't necessarily need to have internal brand teams for the first six months to a year of when they're doing stuff unless they grow really significantly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):
Along these lines, you have a pretty unique way of pricing your work. For people that may want to explore this with you, share whatever you can about just how you think about pricing and ideally even an order magnitude of pricing so they're like, "Oh, okay. We should actually do this."

Jessica Hische (00:50:21):
To go back to the process how it's always about figuring out what people are trying to accomplish, so a lot of my process scales depending on how broad of an exploration that we're doing. The way that I treat it is I treat my branding work not dissimilarly to how I treat commercial lettering, which is atypical. Brand people, what they typically do is because the client has to own the assets outright at the end no matter what, they tend to do is bill everything that the client owns everything as you are moving along. It's all sort of work for hire, but the idea being that it's a buyout of everything that is being made. What that means is that when a branding agency is pricing stuff for you, they're taking the buyout rights and baking it into every round of work so that every round gets more expensive because you are owning all of the work.

(00:51:14):
What I do is I treat it much more like a commercial lettering project where I say, "You have to own the rights to this eventually, but hey, let's break that out and let's keep the creative process lighter and less expensive so then we have more room to explore. So then if some stakeholder comes in last minute and blows everything else up and we need to start over, you haven't already paid to own everything that we've created, you just pay to own the thing that we create in the end that gets chosen." I really like the idea of keeping the creation process more flexible and to try to scale to what people need versus having a really rigid way of approaching everything. Sometimes people will bring me on really early in the process, where if they have an internal team or if they're working with an external agency or something, they want me there from the get out.

(00:52:04):
Some people are like, "We have no money and we are going to try to do this as much as we can inside of our business, but then can we hire you at the end to make it look good? If we can get everybody bought in and get it 80% of the way there." Depending on what people's budgets are, I have different ways of working, or just depending on what their needs are. Because my whole thing too is I don't want to step on anybody's toes, because sometimes companies have these really amazing designers that are working in-house, and it sucks as a designer who started at a company and thinks that you might be able to get a chance to work on what is considered the most important asset in terms of the brand and they just farm it out to someone else instead of letting you touch it. To me, that's a recipe for anything that I create to be immediately killed, because someone inside is going to be like, "It's time to shine," and then they're just going to kill all my work.

(00:52:56):
I'm always like, "How do we collaborate? How do I make it so that I'm an asset to you? Not that I'm trying to step on your toes, not that I'm trying to take over what's the cool juicy work from the people who inside that are really excited to do it." I just want them to feel as bought in as I can be. But yeah, it becomes interesting. I feel like I get told by branding people that I'm too inexpensive because they're like, "Oh, for what you do, it should be 60 or $70,000 at a minimum to do all this kind of stuff." I'm like, I feel like the majority of the projects that I do end up being between 25 and 35, but depending on how you bring me in, it can be less if it's just as a consultant. It's not out of the realm of possibilities to hire a proper crazy expert at stuff. It's not like you're thinking about sinking half a million dollars into the brand. That's a very different experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:51):
Awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Before we get into other stuff that you do, because like you said at the top, there are many other things you do outside of this specific time of work, is there anything else you think might be helpful or important for people to know about working with you on a logo refresh or just thinking about logos and this whole space we talked about?

Jessica Hische (00:54:11):
The best thing is just seeing what's there and really being able to understand what's not working about it and what your goals are. Like I said with that reverse justification of intuition, I think if you know that the logo is not quite where you want it to be, just spend a couple days asking yourself why. "What is the thing about this that bothers me?" Don't get specific. Don't be like, "The way the R is," or whatever. Maybe that's the thing that we talk about down the line, but always think big picture before you think minutiae, because sometimes people think that... They'll throw a bunch of minutiae stuff at me, but it's because they haven't really stopped to think about what is the overall thing that's bothering them.

(00:54:59):
You just never get there if you're always trying to address detail before you address the big picture stuff. You have to just always start super top level, and really ask yourself very broad questions about why you think it's not working, and then go tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and be like... It really could be like, "This C has always bothered me," and then we can get real specific about that when I'm doing the refresh. But I think I also need to understand the overall reason why we're doing this, not just the little bugaboo that bothers you specifically but might not bother anybody else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):
Yeah. When I was thinking about this, it feels like my whole feeling was this could be better. That's all it was for me initially, is just like I feel like it could be a lot better. I imagine that's enough for some people, just like, "I think this could be better," and then here's things [inaudible 00:55:50].

Jessica Hische (00:55:49):
Yeah. That's definitely enough for some people, because I think sometimes... I think you, specifically, had a very clear vibe going on with all of your brand stuff. Some people, it's totally like a mishmash grab bag of random trends and there's no real voice that's coming through. But I feel like you've been doing this for a while, and when you see everything together, there's definitely a very clear vision and vibe that you get from everything. I always tell people that having terrible vision can be your best asset when it comes to logo and brand, because it allows you...

(00:56:30):
Just take your glasses off if you have terrible vision, and look at it, and get the feeling when you can't see the detail. You have to be looking at it with blurred eyes. What is the overall look of this thing? Just trying to get as broad and noodly as you can with it instead of it being about those really specific one by one stuff. I think when you blur your eyes on your brand, there was a really clear cohesiveness to it already. It was just about massaging it into a more consistent professional-looking place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
Well, I can't look at the old logo anymore now that I've gotten this thing coming together, so I'm really excited for this to come out. Just a couple closing questions. One is you have a lot of other stuff going on that is not just typography and logo refreshes. You have children's books, you do lettering for classics, you have a store in Oakland. Talk about all these other things you got going on in case it might interest people.

Jessica Hische (00:57:32):
Sure. Yeah, of course. I'm based here in The Bay, as we've talked about, and I have a studio in Downtown Oakland. My studio is like Barbie's creative Dream house, where the top floor is my office, that's where I'm right now, and then the bottom floor on one side is a workshop. I do a lot of printmaking. I went to college at a school that was very focused on interdisciplinary work, and I feel like I bring a lot of manual analog processes into my work a lot. I find it really important to make physical things as a part of my creative process, so I do a lot of printmaking. On the other side downstairs is a brick and mortar store. I've always wanted to have a brick and mortar store because, as an artist, I think having people have a physical connection to your work can be really important.

(00:58:20):
I think one of the reasons why people hire me to do things for them is because one of the gifts of working with someone that is a real nerd professional about whatever it is that they do is that they bring you along the journey and give you the language to talk about the thing through their eyes and through their experience. To me, the funnest thing for me is actually telling clients and teaching them about all the things that we are doing along the way so then they go out into the world as a newly-minted type nerd and can communicate all of these things to other people. That connection is just really important. The connection to the work, the story behind it, I feel like that's one of the ways that we create lasting work, is understanding that the work exists because there's a story behind it. Things, if they're just created because of the aesthetics or they're just created quickly or whatever, it's really easy to discard them because there's not a story behind it.

(00:59:22):
But if you think about all the objects in your life that have followed you throughout your life, what's a thing that you've had since you were in fifth grade or whatever that is still magically in your possession in your house? You have that because the story of that thing is so important to you. I think that the work that we create, the design that we create, can have that. It can be imbued with so much story and meaning, that when we think about moving on from it, we're like, "Ugh, but this." I think that's one of the ways to build a lasting brand, is to just make sure that the story of creating it feels so real, and visceral, and important. The store is a way for people to have a physical connection to other work that I create, like the prints and things like that.

(01:00:07):
With the kids' book stuff, that's also about creating lasting stuff. I like creating physical things in the world. I like repackaging things that I've learned in therapy in a way that kids will appreciate and enjoy. I'm just always thinking about what's a way that I can say a thing that has been said before but hasn't been said in this way. If I can turn that into a physical object that people can have and appreciate, all the better. But yeah, I don't know. While, professionally, what I do is considered very niche, I feel like all the things that I do are quite diverse, because they tickle different parts of my brain. I have to use my hands in different ways and my mind in different ways. It's how I've been able to generally avoid feeling burnt out as a creative, is just being able to move on between different kinds of work and just feel excited about different things at different times.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):
For folks that want to maybe check out the store, how do they find it? It's called Jessica and Friends, is that right?

Jessica Hische (01:01:08):
Yes. It's called Jessica Hische and Friends.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):
Jessica Hische and Friends.

Jessica Hische (01:01:13):
You can just Google JH&F.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):
Google Maps, yeah. [inaudible 01:01:17]

Jessica Hische (01:01:18):
Yeah. I put JH&F on as a part of the Google Maps name so I don't have to spell my name to strangers, because I have a weird German spelling last name. I also have a second store called Drawling, which is drawing with an L thrown in there. That one is an all-ages art supply store that's sort of a kids' art supply store. That one grew out of JH&F as well. Those two stores exist. With my books, if you just look up my last name on any of your favorite booksellers, you'll find me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):
Last question. I'm just going to throw this out there in case something interesting comes up. We have a segment on this podcast called AI Corner, where I like to see how people have found ways to use AI in their work, in their life to be more productive, do cool things. Is there some way that you've found a way to use AI in the work that you do that makes you do more interesting stuff?

Jessica Hische (01:02:09):
A little bit. I am in this really interesting position in terms of AI where my partner works at Meta on GenAI stuff. He's a director on the GenAI team at Meta and is very bought into AI as a whole thing. I am a little [inaudible 01:02:28] about its impact on a lot of the things that we do. I think, overall, it will become a tool and be very useful, especially in a lot of different fields. But I think this timeframe in which it's more novelty is going to have not the best impact on things like illustration, but eventually, we'll all come out of it and it'll be fine. In terms of how I've been able to integrate it into my process, I did some work for Salesforce last year where the theme for Dreamforce was going to be very AI-driven. I felt like I needed to explore AI as a part of the generative process for creating that art.

(01:03:08):
I did have fun creating custom lettering and then trying to run it through stable diffusion to get stable diffusion to generate instances of my lettering in different styles. We were making these clouds. We ultimately didn't end up using it, but it was still really neat to see. I could see the validity of that in the creative iterative process. I think the biggest thing for me is that I find that the sloggy, slow dregs of work is very fulfilling to me, that a lot of the evangelists of AI are like, "Oh, imagine if you could spend all of your time high level thinking, and coming up with the concepts, and guiding the vision, and whatever, and then just get AI to do everything else that you don't care about." For me, that just sounds like not the most holistic approach to how I work, because the reason why I do all the things that I do and why my process is the way that it is because while I love thinking and I love coming up with conceptual stuff, I find it to be very cerebrally taxing.

(01:04:17):
I need a break from that by doing the more low-key production end of stuff. That's my favorite part of the process, is we know what we're doing, and now it's just about going in. When it comes to judging logos, for instance, the days that I spend knowing exactly what I'm going to do and all it is me just moving little Bezier handles around and getting it feeling right and whatever, those are pure therapeutic zen for me. I think I will always have that as a part of my work and will probably not have AI be outputting that part. But I have been able to have it be helpful in the iterative process a little bit, both through generating sketches with that project and then also through a lot of stuff with writing with my kids' books and things like that, is coming up with lists of words and concepts that are adjacent to each other, whatever.

(01:05:17):
I have found that Claude and ChatGPT are very good for things like that. I'm working on another kids' book now, and I'm trying to think of the directions that it can take. One of them is sort of illustrating different feelings and things like that. I could sit there and brainstorm what are the different emotions or whatever, or I can just ask Claude like, "List 50 emotions," and then I can cherry-pick the ones that come up that feel right. I do find it's really good for that early brainstorming stuff, and that's been really nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):
Is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Jessica Hische (01:05:58):
Yes. Well, I do have a new kid's book coming out in October.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):
Oh, [inaudible 01:06:02].

Jessica Hische (01:06:02):
Aside from all the logo stuff, please do check out my kids' books. It's called My First Book of Fancy Letters, and it is like a new spin on an alphabet book, but instead of it being an alphabet book for brand new babies, which you could totally buy it for brand new babies because it is very simple, and fun, and they'll like the bright pictures, it's for the age where kids can recognize letters but can't necessarily read and write yet because they get so into seeing letters drawn in these different styles and imagining what other letters could be drawn in. Each of the letters is drawn to represent the word that it sounds like. Letters can be athletic, bubbly, or creepy, and then it's like, "Well, what does a creepy C look like?"

(01:06:49):
When kids are starting to understand letter sounds and recognizing letters, they can start thinking about what other words start with that letter sound, and then they start listing stuff out and become immediate over-the-shoulder art directors. It's been really fun showing it to other preschoolers, and TK, and kindergarten kids, because they're immediately like, "Well, R should be a river. It should be a river." I'm like, "Well, how do you draw a river?" It becomes this fun imagination exercise too, so definitely check that out. It's up for pre-order now and comes out October 22nd.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):
That is so delightful. I know you have multiple kids. Do you start to see the idea with one age of kid and then by the time the next kid reaches that age, it's ready and published? Does that work timing-wise?

Jessica Hische (01:07:31):
Yeah, the only thing is both of my... Well, my oldest child is a real super reader. She's always ahead of the game. The second that she could read, she was like, "Oh, picture books are for babies." Now she's reading, she goes into Pegasus books and is just like, "Where are your books for teenagers?" They're like, "You're nine. We're not going to show you that, but here are the middle grade books or whatever." There is a little bit of that. You are a parent, but you are a parent of a very young person. Kids don't want to buy anything you're selling as a parent. There's a little bit of that where I feel like I get so many wonderful letters from other families about how it's their favorite book, and they read it every night, and it's so important, and then my kids are like, "Yeah, yeah. It's just mom's book, whatever."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):
Yeah, that's bittersweet. Well, with that, Jessica, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jessica Hische (01:08:30):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:31):
Speaking of books, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jessica Hische (01:08:36):
Rick Reuben's creativity book is so good. Definitely recommend that. I haven't listened to it on audiobook. I read the physical book, but I also heard the audiobook is very zen. I feel like it's just a very good palate cleanser in terms of being an artist and creating because it feels both high level but also very actionable, so really recommend that. In terms of learning about and understanding typography, there's this book called Inside Paragraphs by Cyrus Highsmith. It's very small and very digestible. You can read it in one bathroom visit, and it's illustrated really well. It has cool illustrations. If you want to learn about some basics of type and typography, it's a really great book, and incredibly accessible, and not like reading Bringhurst or something like that, so big ups to that book. Oh, what's another book?

(01:09:33):
I don't know. I feel like I'm just going to end up recommending all the books that I'm currently reading. This month, I read both Patti Smith's Just Kids, which I loved also and was also... I feel like I'm reading a lot of books about being an artist more so than being a designer. That book, I found really interesting, just hearing her story of moving to New York and having nothing. Just trying to be an artist, and make art, and having that be the thing that drove everything that she and Robert Mapplethorpe did. I don't know, I just feel like I'm looking for ways to get out of my very business-driven sensibilities around art making and get into a space that's more loose, and free, and driven by passions and feelings more so than necessarily career-based milestones and things like that. This is a wild card one too. I just finished The Emperor of All Maladies. I'm just a big fan of reading things about human biology and things like that and found it totally fascinating, so do read that one too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
I can't help but ask, how do you have time to read, raise children, work on so many projects, have a run a store? What is your secret?

Jessica Hische (01:10:50):
Well, you get pretty ruthless about your schedule when you're a parent, where when you're at the office, you are just heads in working, and so I think just trying to stay as focused as possible in that way. I do this thing where I bounce back and forth between projects a lot as I'm losing steam, and so having multiple things to work on keeps me motivated to keep working. I think it's kind of an ADHD thing, where I will start my day one way and then as soon as I start losing steam, I switch to a different thing, lose steam, switch to a different thing, lose steam, switch to a different thing. Rather than taking breaks, I just take a break by working on something that feels fresh. That can be super helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
That's an awesome tip.

Jessica Hische (01:11:36):
Yeah. I mean, it's incredible. I also would tell people when I had first started out, I had a full-time job and then was doing freelance in the evenings. People were like, "How do you not get burnt out, whatever?" It's because my day job was so different from my night job that it felt like I was doing two separate eight-hour shifts instead of one continual sixteen-hour shift. I think that's something to sort of think about, is that there's always going to be things that need to get done as a part of your work or things that you're interested in and passionate about. Just having enough diversity in what that means is going to allow you to maintain enthusiasm for doing all those different things for much longer. Actually, the more homogenous your life and career and job is, the faster you're going to burn out, so just making sure that you have enough variety and all the things that you do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:27):
That was an awesome tip. I'm glad I went there. Okay, back on track to our lightning round. Is there a recent favorite movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jessica Hische (01:12:34):
Severance was my favorite TV show I think I've ever watched.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:38):
The second season's coming out.

Jessica Hische (01:12:40):
I know. That came to mind because I knew the second season was coming out, so I'm just really excited about it, but I think that was probably tops for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Jessica Hische (01:12:51):
Oh, yeah. Well, there's a few things. Well, there was one that's just a super random one that was just pure delight. There's a Japanese brand, Penco, and they make a lot of wonderful stuff. I carry a lot of their stuff in my store. One of the things I bought recently from them is a pen cup, a pencil cup. It's ceramic, but it looks like a paper bag, a lightly crumpled paper bag, and then it just has printed on it Penco, whatever. I just really like it when you take an existing object and give it a new form. I find that to be very delightful, and so that was, I think, one of the things that I really loved recently that I bought for the store.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):
Awesome. Pick two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to share with folks, find useful, and work your life?

Jessica Hische (01:13:38):
It's funny being a lettering artist because I'm not much of a quotes gal, all things considered. I should be because I could make a million dollars by just making "live, laugh, love" pillows or whatever, but I am not usually continually collecting quotes. But I was just at a conference up in Portland called XOXO, and one of the presenters showed a quote on the screen that resonated with me more than most things that I've seen in recent memory. I feel like this is my new... It was one of those quotes that I was like maybe I should get a tattoo of that. When it gets to that level where you're considering a tattoo, you're like, "Okay, that's official." It was "hope is a discipline". I just really loved that. It's by Mariame Kaba or Mariame Kaba.

(01:14:25):
The idea that we have to choose to create positivity, that it's like a choice, and that in order to dream of these things, you can actually create structure and discipline around it, and that it's not just something that is just inherent and comes, you have to actually have a practice around being hopeful and positive. I just really liked that as a concept because I feel that way just about navigating through life, that everything that we do is a choice and that we can choose to frame things one way or frame things another way. Understanding that you have power in that, I think, is really important, and so I just really loved that. Hope is a discipline.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:14):
I really love that. I love any quote that inspires you to not feel like a victim, and gives you agency, and reminds you that you have agency over.

Jessica Hische (01:15:23):
Exactly. That's, I think, was the biggest thing for me is just... Because I feel very well-resourced in being able to deal with hardship because I'm always able to recontextualize and reframe. I think part of that is doing so much intuition justification, which is what we talked about, is walking through things, being like, "Why is this? Why does that happen, la, la, la?" When something bad happens, it's understanding why it happened and then understanding the paths that it can take forward and the different attitudes that you can bring to it that can help you come out of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):
That's beautiful. Okay, final question. I know that you recently remodeled your home. It's quite stunning. You share photos of it online. You worked with this amazing architect to help make it as amazing as it is. As a designer, here's the question, how do you find the balance between trusting someone, their own perspective and design approach, versus pushing into a direction you think that it should go? How do you find a balance as a designer?

Jessica Hische (01:16:28):
Well, I actually feel like it's quite easy for me to trust people to do their own thing, because as long as I go to them as being like, "I appreciate you and your vision and that's why I'm paying you," then the last thing that I want to do is micromanage them, because the reason why I'm paying them is because I don't have the bandwidth to do that myself. Because honestly, I'm one of those people that if I had nothing going on, if my job totally blew up or whatever, I would probably be one of those people that just specialize in a different thing every six months and would be like, "I'm going to build a house now from the ground up. I'm going to do this from now, whatever." I just feel very capable of doing anything that I want to do because I understand that I can find the resources for it.

(01:17:16):
When I hire people to help me do a thing, it's because there is this implicit trust in what they do and that that's why I want to work with them. With the house, I definitely had opinions about stuff. But in general, I'm just like, "Hey, this is your thing. You're the expert. What do you think? Let me give you the parameters and the things that we have to think about. Because you know more about wood resources, and you know more about the cabinet spacing, and whatever, you tell me what you think is going to work best based on all these things that I laid out for you." I found it to be quite easy. I only got really wigged out about a couple of different fine tune-y stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):
I imagine architects and designers are like, "Oh no, it's going to be a designer I'm working with. They have opinions." I'm glad it wasn't that bad.

Jessica Hische (01:18:09):
I feel like my strength with the work that I do in general is just being incredibly decisive and understanding that there's 10 good answers to every one question. Some people are real maximalists about decision-making and need to look at every gray sofa that exists before they can choose the one gray sofa. Whereas I feel like I can look at 10 gray sofas and go, it feels like there's two or three categories of sofa here, and then within those categories, there's a couple of good options. Here's a brand that I recognize is known for being of high quality. That one's good enough. I can get to it really quickly, and I feel like not everybody can do that. And I think that that permeates through everything that I do in my life. It definitely is a huge part of the logo work, because you really can do anything when it comes to typography.

(01:18:57):
It can go in 50 million directions. It's just about having someone tell you, "Yes, we could take this anywhere, but these are the valid paths. If we go down this path, this is the most intuitive and most correct way to do it that is closest and most accessible to us. We can noodle on it until kingdom come, but do we have to? This is good." I don't know. I feel like there's some weird knowledge around understanding that nothing is ever 100% perfect, and the most you can aspire and get to is 99.8 or whatever. That last 0.2%, you could spend your whole life trying to do that, or you could move on and do other things and understand that it's nearly perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:49):
That is really good advice and a freeing piece of advice. Jessica, it's been an honor to work with you on this logo. I am really excited for people to see it, for it to be the new look of everything I'm doing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and potentially work with you, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jessica Hische (01:20:07):
Oh, yeah. Of course. I have a website that I occasionally update. It is jessicahische.is/awesome. You'll notice I have a bunch of weird URLs on my website. That's a place to find me. Otherwise, I am on Instagram and Threads a lot. I was formerly a very active Twitter person, and now I'm not really there so much and I bop around with the Twitter clones, but I'm on Threads quite a bit. Instagram and Threads are good for social. Email, I'm easy, hello@jessicaHische.com. What your readers could do for me, I think it's the work that I do in terms of the logo refresh stuff. I feel like this audience is just totally my perfect audience for it because you guys are all a bunch of smart, awesome founders that want beautiful logos, but understand that sometimes you just got to get that first viable option out the door. Once you're ready, you come to me and I help you and it's great.

# Building minimum lovable products, stories from WeWork & Airbnb, and thriving as a PM | Jiaona Zhang

## Transcript

Jiaona Zhang (00:00:00):
I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking. Working with go-to--market teams and cross-functional stakeholders that could be like your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems, find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:00:43):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is JZ. JZ is senior vice president of product at Webflow. She's also a lecture at Stanford, teaching a course on product management. Before this, she was senior director of product management at WeWork, a longtime product leader at Airbnb, where I got to work with JZ for a number of years and she's also PM at Dropbox and at a gaming company called Pocket Gems.

(00:01:12):
In her conversation, we dig into the most common mistakes early product managers make in their career. Plus JZ's biggest product mistake. We cover the concept of minimal lovable products versus minimal viable products. We talk about JZ's unique frameworks for road mapping and prioritization and OKRs and her take on how to structure your first 90 days as a product leader at a new company, plus what she's learned from her wild year at WeWork. Also, the best advice she's ever gotten around product and leadership and the story of Airbnb Plus and where it went wrong.

(00:01:43):
I've been hoping to get JZ on the podcast for a while and I'm really happy that we finally made this happen. With that, I bring you JZ after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:53):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.

(00:02:35):
If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to be become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:03:10):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people publish in the Miro verse.

(00:03:45):
When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. Actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:04:22):
JZ, welcome to the podcast.

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:24):
Thanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:26):
It's 100% my pleasure. Amongst your many accomplishments, you teach product management at Stanford, which sounds very fancy. How long have you been doing this at this point?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:37):
I think six years. Yeah.

Lenny (00:04:40):
Okay. So my question, the real question I want to ask about this is, in that time you've seen a lot of new PMs and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?

Jiaona Zhang (00:04:56):
I think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something that you can see in your head that you want to build.

(00:05:16):
And so that's the first thing I really want to unteach in our course. And so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, "I want to build X startup" or "I want to do this thing," or "I'm in blank school and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area." And so untraining that and being like, "Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.'" So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.

Lenny (00:05:55):
Does a lot of this come from people want to get into product management because they think "Finally I'll have the power, finally I'll be able to tell people what to build, finally my ideas really going to matter?" Is that where a lot lobby comes from?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:06):
I think there's a part of that. One of the first things I teach is you're not a CEO, you're, you're not here... You actually have very little true authority because you don't actually manage anyone. A lot of it is all through influence, and so that is also a piece where you have to kind of untrain that thinking. I do think a lot of people come into the product role thinking that I get to call the shots, I get to make the decisions, I get to decide what gets built. And really your job is not that. Your job is to understand here are the opportunities, and then you're kind of pulling together all the different possibilities and you're really editing. So I do think it comes from desire for a lot of people thinking that's what the product role is when it actually isn't.

Lenny (00:06:44):
So let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?

Jiaona Zhang (00:06:53):
Wow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people, we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there. And this one does stand out to me, we were working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, "Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like "[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?"

(00:07:38):
And so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, "Let's go inspect our inventory, let's actually try to manage our inventory more." And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, "What's the real problem? The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better." And I think the other piece here that's really important is, what, as a company is your strategic strength and what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. Again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics, are the unit economics actually going to work even as you scale?

Lenny (00:08:22):
Yeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell and that could be its own podcast, I guess.

Jiaona Zhang (00:08:28):
You and I can tell it.

Lenny (00:08:30):
We could tell this could be Airbnb Plus The Hidden Story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust... They don't want to even consider Airbnb because it's like, "No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable." And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. "We're going to vet them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar." And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like "This is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this because we don't make that much per booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical"? Or do you think there was a path that was just not executed well?

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:10):
I think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was less of-

Lenny (00:09:10):
Yeah, that's my impression.

Jiaona Zhang (00:09:15):
Exactly. And it was more just like if you understood... Again, this is what my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, "When we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen." I think you actually need to really make sure that unit economics work quite at the beginning. That is definitely one lesson. And I think the other thing is, and going back to spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.

(00:09:51):
And I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about, is it cleaning? Is it, "Hey, I'm locked out"? And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property. It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas and then get that as part of the fee, as opposed to doing the inspection. So again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at?

(00:10:33):
And so I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all, "Hey, we're going to go inspect." It's like what is the problem for this listing and what's the best solution to fix that problem?

Lenny (00:10:51):
There's a couple things that I think are important product leadership lessons here. One is Airbnb and Brian and many great leaders are famous for imagining the ideal situation, imagining the great end result and then working backwards. And often that leads to great results when you're being really ambitious and "I don't know how we're going to get there, we're just going to shoot big and hopefully we figure it out." Sometimes it works out. In this case it didn't work out. And what you're finding, maybe you even knew this early on, is just like there's no possible world where this could have worked in this approach. Is there anything you've learned about just when to think big and not even like "Forget it. We're going to figure it out. I know this seems impossible, but we're just going to try it anyway"? Do you have any kind of framework of when to think big, then just go for it? Versus, "Oh, let's just work out the math today," is this ever possible?

Jiaona Zhang (00:11:42):
I think it's really important for every company to be dreaming big. If you don't have a big vision, it's really hard for you to innovate, but you got to couple that really big vision with thoughtfulness around your execution. And so I think that one of the biggest tips I have is how do to be clear about the phase that you're in? So I think it's totally fine to be like, "Hey, we are going to try X for six months, three months, whatever it is, and we're explicitly going to go learn these types of things. We're going to learn why are people? Are there signals that we would that would indicate that again, the communication with host isn't great or this type of listing, if it's hosted by a person with multiple property?" I think there are factors we can be like, "Hey, we can learn this very explicit thing in a given period of time."

(00:12:32):
And you can do what I call unscalable things in that prototyping phase, in that early phase to go learn those lessons. But you just have to be very, very clear with your team on what phase you're in. "Hey, we're in the learning phase and we explicitly are trying to learn these things" versus, "Hey, we have this really big vision and we're just going to go at it." That is not recommended in my mind. It's breaking it down into these smaller chunks. That I think gets you the balance of thinking really, really big, but also being able to be like, "Okay, we are still going to be able to say, 'Okay, this path is not going to work out. We ran at it for a short period of time. We got these learnings, now let's go down this other path.'"

Lenny (00:13:11):
Yeah, there's also some cost fallacy that kicks in of just like, "Oh, I spend so much time and money and resources on this thing. Let's just go a little bit longer. Let's just see if we give it another quarter, maybe it'll work out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:13:21):
You should articulate what success looks like and the milestones you want to hit in the small intervals that I talked about. So you don't get into this world where you're like, "Hey, I've gone for two years investing in this thing. Now we got to cut it." It's like, what is the quarter long milestone? Okay, what's the next quarter long milestone? And every single point, what is a go and no-go? And I think that really can help a team and a company say "It's okay. I invested a quarter in it, but I didn't invest two years."

Lenny (00:13:46):
The other important lesson here is about the importance of as a product leader pushing back and convincing leadership that you are wrong and this shouldn't happen. I remember talking to one of our colleagues, Mike Lewis, who was leading a different team with Airbnb, and he was just like, "Oh, I realized I'm the person that should be saying, 'No, we shouldn't do this now'" because he was the head of product for one of the new [inaudible 00:14:09]. And I know maybe in that situation it was impossible because Brian was very into this and everyone was like, "We need to do this thing."

(00:14:18):
I guess is there anything you've learned about how to push back on these sorts of things that the founder's really into when it makes sense to go along? Like "Cool, let's do it. Let's buy in." As a leader, you have to be excited and he needs to feel like, "Oh, JZ is really excited about this too. We got to try it." Even though maybe you feel like it's not going to work out. So I guess the question is when do you think it makes sense to try convince the founder, "No, this is the bad idea" versus like "Let's go for it"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:14:42):
I think first it comes down to your conviction. Do you actually have conviction that this is a bad idea or are you personally still learning? Right. I think if you're at the point, if you're like, "I have total conviction," then your job is to say, no, you really... If you do not, you're not doing your job. And then the question is what are the tips in how to convince someone who's very bought into an idea that that's not the right idea? And there what I would say is it's understanding the spirit of what they're trying to achieve. Being able to go back with, "Hey, I understand the spirit. The spirit is that we're trying to get people who previously didn't consider Airbnb before to come and use Airbnb, but the right way to do it is not this very time-intensive, cost-intensive way to inspect all these homes. The way to do it is to be much more granular in what we ask people when they upload their home and more checks in that. And that could be automated and through technology as opposed to through humans."

(00:15:37):
It's coming back with actual options. It's like saying... And I think we did that a little bit to be honest, when we as a team evolve, we learn and we're like, "This isn't going to work." And I explicitly moved off the team and I was like, "I'm going to work on the review system. I'm going to continue to evolve this and make it better because that is the actual scalable way to do this as opposed to keep going at it in the very manual process."

(00:15:59):
And so I think that the biggest tip I would have for people in this situation is really understand whether it's the founder or your manager or whoever it is, what is it that they're trying to accomplish for the user and for the business? Remind them of that, get aligned on that. And then come back with better options. A lot of these people, they're very smart and they're very motivated. They ultimately want to just do the right thing for their users. When you come back with a much better solution and you have the data and you have the thinking behind it's very rare that someone will be like, "I still want to go after this solution despite the fact that it's not working and you proposed a much better path forward."

Lenny (00:16:37):
And I think to touch on what you've already said is also make sure it's actually... There's a world where this could work. Do some math to figure out if this is a business that will actually make some money in the future.

Jiaona Zhang (00:16:49):
Totally.

Lenny (00:16:50):
Okay. I'm going to bounce around a little bit. I have a bunch of different questions around different topics. You popularized this concept of minimal lovable product versus this idea that everyone always comes back to, which is minimal viable product. Can you just talk about what is a minimal lovable product and then when does it make sense to go in that direction versus a traditional MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:17:10):
The reason I care so much about minimal lovable product is because I do think in a world where there are so many different options, it's hard to just feel like, "Hey, use this thing. It barely meets a quality bar." And so I think this idea of actually deeply understanding for the thing that you're working on, what is a lovable experience? What is the quality bar that resonates with your users? And again, especially in a world where there might be a lot of different options. Minimal lovable products is the new MVP. The new minimal viable product.

(00:17:40):
So I think that's the real point, but at the end of the day, it does come back to what are the options that a user has and what are they trying to do? So there's a world where your quality bar, your "Quality bar," or let's call it your polished bar, can be a little bit lower because the reality is the thing that you're "Competing against" or you're replacing is literally a manual workflow. It's like spreadsheets. It's doing something in a super terrible way.

(00:18:05):
So you want to get your product to market as quickly as possible, so it doesn't make sense for you to be like, "I'm going to build these 15 additional features." Because compared to what people are doing right now, your product without those 15 additional features is perfectly fine, perfectly usable, and perfectly quite honestly lovable. So it requires a lot of understanding of, again, your users and the space that you play in and the tolerance of your given user. So for example, a designer might have a lot higher of a bar of like "This is the kind of workflow I want, this is the kind of bar for my product." But again, someone sitting on the finance team or the IT team, their bar might be like, "Oh, I'm used to doing these 15 things and so your thing is just a lot better."

Lenny (00:18:53):
I'd love to go even one level deeper. Is there an example of something you've worked on that was minimal lovable product that you think about? Or is there something out there that's an example of here's maybe an example of a minimal lovable product versus MVP?

Jiaona Zhang (00:19:08):
Again, it's very hard. I think every product team, every product person struggles with this idea of what is the minimal viable. Even that concept itself is difficult and not to mention minimal lovable. I'll give a Webflow example. Very recently, so have been investing in a couple of new features, memberships and logic, new functionality for our users. And what we realized at the end of the day after investing in these areas, we were like, "Hey, we can get to minimal viable, but we don't know if we can actually get to minimal lovable in a way that our users really, really want. And so does it make sense for us to continue to go down this path of continues to chip away to get to minimal lovable when we are maybe hitting diminishing returns for our user base? Or does it actually make sense to release what we have but then encourage our ecosystem to contribute the lovable piece?"

(00:19:56):
And again, it's not just like you put it out there and you hope, you have to have a very strong point of view of are we at minimal viable, are we at minimal lovable? Where in between are we? And so having that point of view and then being able to say, "Are we going to be able to meet it as a company? Are we going to rely on our ecosystem to help us meet it? What are we actually going to do?" And then even within the feature set, it's very much a how do we do some things well as opposed to do a little bit of everything? I think that is a big piece of minimal lovable, which is again... To me it's better to do five things instead of the 15 things in a really, really great way with a high degree of polish with a, "Oh, this really meets my need," versus trying to do everything and just doing a little bit of everything. And so every part of the experience feels a little bit clunky. It's not quite there.

(00:20:45):
People I think would actually respect this idea of "You've given me minimal lovable in five areas as opposed to minimal viable in 15 areas."

Lenny (00:20:53):
Is there anything you've seen of just that makes something lovable? I don't know. I know it's not easy to define, but what are things you've seen that makes something lovable? Is it delightful features? Or is it what you're saying, which is just things are actually good, there's fewer things, but they're each really good?

Jiaona Zhang (00:21:08):
There's definitely this idea of the thing is just good. It has all. High quality, it's not janky, it doesn't feel weird. I'll give you a very small example again, just from Webflow, this idea of keyboard shortcuts, feels small, but that is a piece that creates a lot of love from user base who are power users. And then there's this concept of pixie dusts, and maybe I'll pull out of call it like design tool space and we'll talk about some of the other things, whether it's Dropbox or Airbnb, but you can just do a little bit of that extra pixie dusts. So an example from Airbnb when we're doing the mobile app revamp where like "There's like these basic table stakes, but if we actually added in templates and we made it so that these templates could be maybe pre-populated in certain ways from the content they already have," that is lovable, that is that extra little bit of pixie dust and spending the time to do that.

(00:21:55):
Again, you can't pixie dust everything. At the end of the day, you basically have your time, your staffing and the scope of your project and something has to give. And so at the end of the day, you can't just keep investing, keep investing because it's going to push out your launch timeline, but can you pick a few different areas where you're like, "I'm going to scatter that pixie dust, I'm going to do a little bit more than what users are expecting"? And that creates that lovability.

Lenny (00:22:20):
Shifting to a different topic, I know you have strong opinions about road mapping and OKRs, improvisation, and I know that's a big topic, but let me just ask, what's the most common advice you give around how to roadmap well, do OKRs, prioritize and/or just, I don't know, common mantras or things you always come back to be successful in these areas?

Jiaona Zhang (00:22:40):
Road mapping prioritization are one bucket for me. And then OKRs is another. So I'll maybe give you my biggest tip in each one of these buckets.

(00:22:46):
So for road mapping, my biggest thing that I tell my teams is "You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in these levers, the biggest ones to pull?" And what I really don't want, what I think is a very common mistake from road mapping is people thinking a spreadsheet with a bunch of projects, the RICE framework, everything has an impact, a cost and an effort column filled out. They think that is prioritization and that is a roadmap. If you just do that right and then you present that to your team, they're off to the races.

(00:23:26):
But what people, what humans really crave is like, "Why am I doing this body of work?" And I think it's also really, really important to have that really crisply articulated in your own head because ultimately what happens is you'll learn things as a product person. You'll be like, "Oh, I assumed this in the narrative in my head about my users or about my product area, and then I learned why and therefore my thinking changed." So instead of it being this massive spreadsheet where you're going in, you're tweaking all the values, what is the story that you're telling about your roadmap that these inputs can then go and influence?

(00:23:59):
It could be like, "Hey, I just realized I didn't know before that we have a lot more power users on our," or "Maybe we have a lot more non-technical users." That input changes my roadmap and changes my themes in a pretty dramatic way. So skating at that level is really, really critical, I think for a roadmap as opposed to going down to the really granular details of the how. So that's the biggest thing on road mapping, which is like tell a story. What are your themes? Make it so that your team can come up with the actual how and the projects and all the little details, but really create that scaffolding for them to know what's important.

Lenny (00:24:33):
Can I ask a follow-up question on that?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:35):
Totally, yeah.

Lenny (00:24:36):
It's easy to visualize the roadmap of a spreadsheet to help people visualize what you're suggesting there. What does that actual artifact look like? Is it a doc with maybe an ancillary spreadsheet of the actual prioritization? Is it a deck? How do you actually deliver this to you with like "JZ, here's our proposal for our team"?

Jiaona Zhang (00:24:55):
Yeah, I'm a big fan of docs and decks are obviously helpful if you're talking live, but I do think in a remote-first culture or lots of us are in hybrid remote cultures it's hard because decks typically require a voiceover. And so we have been doing a big push even on my teams where I'm like, "Write it down and document. Force yourself to write the pros because when you write the pros, you can actually add that level of granularity." So very much so the same way like "I'm a roadmap is a story. You're telling themes, you write a story in a notebook, you write a story on pages," and so a doc is definitely preferred. And even in the doc just being like, "Here's what we're trying to achieve, here are the big areas I want to invest in, here are my big themes." And then going into each of those themes and being like, "These are the big projects."

(00:25:40):
And then linking out, again, not even to a spreadsheet, but linking out to the artifacts and the systems that your team actually uses. So if your team uses Jira, go ahead and link out to Jira because so often docs get out of... Or spreadsheets get out of date, because they're like a snapshot of whatever it is that you needed at that point in time. But instead you link out to the actual things that your teams are working out of, you can always be like, "These are the themes. I will edit these if I learn major things that would change my themes. And then let's go link out to the Jira where you can just see the snapshot of the roadmap at any given point in time."

Lenny (00:26:12):
Do you have a template or common structure you suggest to teams for laying out this story or is it just depends on the quarter, it depends on the year?

Jiaona Zhang (00:26:21):
I'll give a plug for a new thing coming out of Reforge, which is this concept of artifacts. And so we do have a lot of artifacts out there, so what's our general product development process? What are our templates for our specs? What are our templates for some of these things that we're talking about, a roadmap, like a broader roadmap instead of just a feature spec. So yes, we have a ton of those artifacts, are always evolving. I think every team takes it and tweaks it a little bit, but I'm a big believer of bringing those artifacts back and then sharing them across the team. And so product operations is also a function that we've invested in because it just really greases the wheels, gets all of our teams speaking the same language.

Lenny (00:26:57):
Awesome.

(00:28:02):
Moving to a different topic, what is your number one piece of advice to new PMs who want to accelerate their career? What do you find most often is the blocker or thing holding them back or something they can change that'll accelerate things?

Jiaona Zhang (00:28:18):
There's so many parts to it, but I'll pick one. And there are many frameworks even beyond the one, but let's pick one for your question, which is I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. And what I mean by that is when you're known in your company for a particular thing.... I'll give you a couple examples. You could be known for shepherding the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking, working with go-to market teams and cross-functional stakeholders, that could be your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems. You could be known for working on things that are really regulatory complex. Find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get. Because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.

Lenny (00:29:16):
Is there something you were known to be excellent at in the course of your career?

Jiaona Zhang (00:29:20):
I would say early on in my career, it was actually the fact that I had a strong analytics background. And so when I joined gaming, I came from consulting, I didn't have any CS background or design background, and so it was really creating a reputation around being very analytical, around being able to analyze the datasets of my game and then make decisions. I also learned as I was doing that I was actually really good at execution, and so being able to keep a lot of plates spinning and working on the largest studio and managing all the complex pieces of that, that was what I discovered. I didn't know this, but I discovered as I started working in the role.

(00:29:58):
And so that was something I brought to Dropbox. When I joined Dropbox. It was like I knew that I could work with a lot of different teams and make sure that we hit a launch deadline, and so I would find myself trying to lean into that superpower and then when delivering upon that, getting more responsibility, "Hey, you just launched this really complex thing, this was a project that had to work across a lot of different platforms. We're using Griddle APIs." And it was a very, very small team and it had a very, very tight deadline.

(00:30:29):
So when you're like, "I can do something like this," you end up getting more responsibility because people were like, "Oh, she was able to do something that was really hard with a small team," and so that's how you get more responsibility. But it has evolved in my career. I think that at the beginning of your career, you do want to lean into some of these pieces. It makes sense, but also even when you start to manage, it shifts dramatically. Being known as the best executor is not necessarily the thing that gives you and your team the most responsibility. So as I've grown my career, whether it's at Airbnb or WeWork or other places I flex into maybe a different... It's like taking your core strength but then flexing it and finding different ways to bring it to life.

Lenny (00:31:09):
Much of what I just heard is you just worked incredibly hard and just got shit done. And I think that's very, very important and often leads to a lot of success.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:20):
PMs have to get shit done. Yeah, ultimately you're responsible for the outcome just no matter what happens.

Lenny (00:31:26):
Yeah. I like that. Be known for getting shit done and working really hard, and that's never going to serve you badly. I think that is just lasting advice for being successful as a PM. I realized that we were talking about your tips on prioritization, road mapping and then OKRs, and then I shifted topics and you never got to the OKR bucket. So let me come back to that.

Jiaona Zhang (00:31:47):
Yes. My biggest tip on OKRs is actually get really, really crisp on qualitatively. What would make you say "Yes, we did a great job"? And the reason I pushed so hard on that is because I see so many teams get really mucked down by OKRs. They're like, "Oh man, if I don't hit my OKR, I feel like I'm going to have a really bad reputation, or maybe I won't get promoted." You just get all this fear around OKRs. And so you see people, you see people sandbagging, you see people being hesitant to put in numbers until the very last second until they're super, super confident. And that results in ultimately a failure for your company to innovate and move quickly.

(00:32:29):
And so what I really push on for OKRs is are you actually... What's the spirit... I think I asked this question maybe too much to my team, but what is the spirit of what you're trying to achieve and what would make you say, 'I really, really crushed it this past quarter'? And so it's less about I would rather have all the OKRs be red or yellow and we missed everything and we learned around why we missed it than everything to be green. In fact, when everything's green, you're like, "We definitely did not set ambitious enough OKRs." And so it really pushed a lot on what does it truly mean to crush it and be successful? What does it mean for our users? What does it mean for our business? What does that... For our users to feel X, can you describe that? Can you write that out? For our business to see this in terms of the revenue growth?

(00:33:17):
And I think it's really hard because a lot of times, you get your data scientists, you get the PM themselves being like, "Oh man, I'm owning an input metric, not an output metric. And so I definitely can't sign up for that revenue target because I have an input metric." And all of those things are true, but if you don't do the homework of really drawing that line of being like, "This is the ultimate thing I want to do for the company and for my users," then a lot of times you end up hitting all your OKRs, but the company and your users at large are like, "I don't feel anything different." Your company doesn't look at the things that you've worked on and they don't say like "This is a smashing success." Your users are feeling no differently. And so that is the worst outcome in my head where your OKRs, you're almost like doing OKRs for the sake of OKRs, as opposed to letting them be a guide to delivering really great product to your end customer.

Lenny (00:34:09):
I like the idea of that, but imagine what often happens is you sign up for an ambitious OKR, you don't wait till the last second to commit to it and then ends up being red, and then you go into performance reviews and like, "Oh, Lenny didn't hit his OKRs. Look at this guy. His team is not doing great." How do you think about that as a product leader understanding if the team actually did well and the PM is performing well when they sign up for these really ambitious OKRs and their story's great and they're doing the right thing, but they fail?

Jiaona Zhang (00:34:37):
First of all, I think it's creating a culture where you are not punished for that. Because I definitely don't want a culture where it's like you took a risk and you failed and therefore your performance is impacted. I'd much rather people take risks than to be safe. So I think that's the first thing. That being said, you're also not doing a good job as a PM if you're like, "This is my super, super ambitious thing," and you're like, "I have no idea how to achieve it." Your job is to dream big and also have a plan to go tackle it. And so what I would expect the PM to be able to say is, "This is my North Star. I'm not going to be able to do that in a quarter, that just is unreasonable, but here are the five milestones," whatever number, some number of milestones "That it's going to take me to do quarter over quarter to achieve this really, really ambitious thing. And let me draw you that path. Here's the milestone all the way across, and this is the first one. This is why it's so meaningful."

(00:35:24):
So I expect that combination where you're like, "I know where I'm going. It's really, really ambitious." And then you can then break it down. But again, I would much rather have someone shoot for the moon, even for someone to say like "This is the thing I really want to do. I don't know my path yet" than to be really, really safe. Because when you're safe, you're always going to be building something suboptimal. It's going to be suboptimal use of your resources as opposed to actually trying to figure out what the best swing that you can take is.

Lenny (00:35:50):
So it sounds like it comes back to the story of the roadmap and what they're trying to accomplish, and just as long as it feels like the story made sense, there's a path there. The team did their best, I think we know it was really ambitious. We kind of knew maybe they wouldn't get there. It sounds like that's kind of the thing you look for in a performance of the PM.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:07):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:10):
Awesome. I mentioned WeWork and I want to spend a little time on WeWork. You were at WeWork for about a year, and I think it was in the middle of a lot of the craziness that went on at WeWork.

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:18):
It was. It was 2019, I feel like that year it was either headlines were either about Trump or about WeWork in the news.

Lenny (00:36:26):
That's tough. So what was that like being a PM leader at a company in that craziness? And is there a takeaway from that experience that helps you be a better product manager, a leader, person?

Jiaona Zhang (00:36:37):
Yeah, I learned a lot from my time there. I think the most important lesson I learned was really around... I think there's like a people leader management lesson, and then there's also just like a how do you build an org period. The people lesson I learned was just really around empathy. In fact, essentially what I was doing was I built a team. I spent the first six months of my time there actually growing my team a lot, and not just in the US but in Asia and in Europe. And then the second half of my time there was actually being like, "What do we do? If this is what's happening with WeWork, what are we actually going to do with all of these people who have come to WeWork to work?"

(00:37:19):
And there was so many lessons there around leadership, around how do you think about people? How do you think about giving them the right transition plans? It was a lot of learning. And I think probably a lot of people, even right now through the macroeconomic downturn, they're learning that lesson in a really hard way. And so it was definitely something that I got a crash course on, I think early.

(00:37:44):
And the second lesson really was around not over-hiring. And so I think that was huge, and I think I personally learned that lesson through my time there. And it's something that I'm very conscious of at any company that I go to. Just because laying off half your team is a terrible feeling. Literally having hired people and then having to let them go, it's not something you want to do. And so being really thoughtful around how do we not over-hire? How are we really clear about, again, these milestones of we got to get through these gates, we got to be able to show these types of results, and then we unlock hiring in X, Y, Z ways? That hygiene is really, really important.

Lenny (00:38:22):
Feels like this connects back to the Airbnb Plus story of "Let's just be really ambitious. We don't have any idea how we're going to get there, but we're just going to go for it, hire like crazy, scale, put a lot of investment in this thing and hopefully we'll figure it out."

Jiaona Zhang (00:38:34):
I do think there was a little bit of that in the ethos of how WeWork was functioning, for sure. I think that what was really important for us to do was to be like, "We have this." Operationally, WeWork is really strong. In fact, I went to WeWork because having been at Airbnb, I was like, "I don't feel like we've dialed this operational muscle down," but I know from what I've seen and the way WeWork has expanded, that they're really, really excellent at the operations. But I think it was, again, we hired beyond our skis on the tech side. It's like we don't need a team of this size to go do the things that are needed for the product to feel really great. At the end of the day, it's about booking. And yes, there's technology that would accelerate that, but do we need it to be super platform aware? Do we need it to be super futuristic? That's actually not what people care about.

(00:39:19):
So this all goes back to what are people's core desires in whatever product that they're using, whatever thing that your business is trying to serve them? And so really understanding that will help you have a sense of, "Hey, you can still be really ambitious." Again, in a hybrid world, it's like why have real dedicated office space? Every company could go through WeWork as opposed to this dedicated space. That's still a really good idea, that's still a really big vision and a relevant vision, but what's the key piece of that vision? The key piece of that vision is around inventory, and then you make that inventory management easier. You make all of these things easier, but that's not a technology play in the same way as it is an operational play. So just really understanding, again, you can still dream really big, but you don't have to dream big and hire big in all the things in order to have a very ambitious vision that you deliver to the market.

Lenny (00:40:13):
If you think back to WeWork, what was your favorite memory and what was your hardest, least happy memory if anything comes to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:40:23):
I think this idea dream really big. I think everyone who had joined WeWork, they were like, "We could do a lot here." The idea of really the physical space infusing technology. I just feel like the people at WeWork were dreamers in the best possible way. So that definitely... I feel like for every company that I've been at, it's really about, you join... I personally joined for the product, but I stayed for the people you joined because you're like, "I want to work on this mission. This product is really motivating." And then you really stay for the people. And the people at We WeWork were really great. So that was definitely my favorite memory.

(00:40:58):
I think the hardest memory was, this gets a little bit personal, but I was actually in my first trimester when we were going through all of these layoffs and I basically was faced with a choice. It was like, "Hey, do I stay at WeWork? I would be guaranteed maternity leave." I was going to be moved onto this other team that was definitely going to stay. "Do I do that or do I actually..." And I think there just a last piece of... The thing I was wrestling with is I hired a lot of these people and I felt really responsible for the fact that I convinced them to come to this company that now was going through a lot of change.

(00:41:33):
And I specifically remember someone when I hired them, we had a long conversation about their visa and in my head I was like, "I just don't feel right. Again, laying someone off. That's only going to have so many days to be able to go find their new role." And so the hardest moment, I actually remember this very vividly, "Am I going to take this new role or am I going to put myself on a layoff list essentially and give the role to someone else on the team?" When I really think about it, yes, I was pregnant, but I would have more time and more freedom to go find my next thing versus someone who I brought to the company who was on a visa.

(00:42:09):
That to me just really stood out and goes back to this concept around leadership is so much about empathy and people as much as it's about understanding your market, your customers, and the strategy of your product.

Lenny (00:42:24):
Damn. What convinced you eventually to take off and try something different?

Jiaona Zhang (00:42:31):
I made the call of, in that particular case, I'd give the role to someone else. And then once I made that call, I was like, "I got to go find something. I know that this is my last day, so I have to go find something." And it was really interesting because I actually... I went through an interview process. I was in my second trimester and then ultimately I chose to join Webflow and I joined when I was literally at the beginning of my third trimester. So I had exactly 90 days before my first son was born.

Lenny (00:43:01):
That's a great segue to the question I was going to ask is around your 90-day plan that I know you put a lot of thought into how to think about the first 90 days, but before we get there, the movie on WeWork with Jared Leto, how similar to reality was that brought?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:16):
I actually have not watched it. Parent life, you don't have any time. And I do think there's... I feel like if you ask people at Uber, if they've watched some of the [inaudible 00:43:26] they're like, "It's not for me." Same way why I haven't watched Silicon Valley. You're like, "It's a little too close to home."

Lenny (00:43:35):
It was quite a great movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm curious how close it was to real life. Okay, so then back to the 90-day questions. So I know you spent a lot of time thinking about your first 90 days at Webflow, you're pregnant as you described, and you have a perspective on just how to think about the first 90 days when you join a company. Can you just share what you've learned there, what you recommend there?

Jiaona Zhang (00:43:55):
Yeah, I do think the first 90 days, depending on your role is very different. But maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the first 90 days as a head of product. Because you're like, "Whoa." Or even just as a leader, how do you go in, how do you really absorb all the information and get all the context you need and then affect change? And I think what was unique about my first 90 days is it was time bound. It was literally something where you're like, "Sure, I'd love to absorb information for many months, but I just don't have the luxury of the time" and so-

Lenny (00:44:21):
Because you're going to go on mat leave right after?

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:23):
Because yeah, essentially I was going to go on mat leave.

Lenny (00:44:25):
Got it.

Jiaona Zhang (00:44:25):
That's right. And so the biggest things that I thought a lot about for my first 90 days was at the end of the day, yes, you have to really... The most important thing for anyone's for assigning days is to build context and to build context well. But what I had to think about a lot was, "How do I quickly build context probably faster than I would be given the luxury any other time in my life?" And so I thought a lot about who do I speak to at the company? How do I create even just a calendar of speaking to people? Yes, my leadership team, but also across a bunch of functions and then across a bunch of levels. So it was really important for me to even start talking to some of the engineers from the team, some of the engineers who had been there for the longest time to really understand, what's hard about our tech stack? What's going on? What's hard about your day to day?

(00:45:15):
And so I actually took time to really think about, "I want to speak to all of these types of people at the company." And I packed my first couple weeks with a lot of those meetings. And so I think that was one piece, which is like how do you build context as quickly as possible? And my tip there is again, it's not just with your peers, it's not even just with your team, but to really think across all the different functions and then think about where you're going to get the most amount of information in that particular function. I think that was one piece of it.

(00:45:43):
The other piece was I was like, "I'm going to be out." I was only out for two months, but I was like, "That's still a long period of time in the life of a startup." And so what it was really important to me was like, I did not go out having just listened and like "Great, I have the context, I'll see you in two months." But it was really important for me to actually have a plan in place before I went out for my team.

(00:46:03):
And so there were pieces where I was like, "I want to first, again, get that lay of the land. I want to have enough of a strategic, 'Hey, these things make sense. Keep going, keep executing.' 'These things don't make sense, let's identify what those things are and let's actually start to do research around these things so that when I do come back, we have a body of work that we can look at and be like, "Okay, this information, this data is making us choose to go down the path." Or "This is a go or no-go decision. We can make that decision now where we couldn't make that decision before."'"

(00:46:34):
So that was another big piece, which is getting all the strategic pieces in place, having a plan laid out and explicitly articulating in that plan, "Keep moving. These are things that we got to do a lot more research on." And then assigning people like, "Hey, you're going to do this research and then we're going to come back and talk about it in the two months that I was out." And I also took the time, I actually... Funny story, I think I literally had a board meeting the day before I went in for a checkup, and then in the checkup they're like, "You're in labor." And it was really important for me to do that because I was like, "For the things that I'm seeing, for the gaps that I'm seeing. I want everyone to be aware. I don't want to just be with one founder. I want the whole leadership team. I want all the founders, I want the board. I want everyone to be aware that."

(00:47:14):
For example, engineering hiring was really, really important. And I was communicating, "Hey, we are just not staffed in a way where we can deliver some of the ambitious things that we want to do." And so explicitly calling those things out and creating awareness around them and then asking other executives to step in and be accountable, those were big pieces of what I wanted to achieve in my first 90 days.

Lenny (00:47:34):
So I take notes on this. So the first is just get context, figure out who you need to talk to. Is there a tip there of just how many people? Because you could do this infinitely, meet everyone eventually. How many people did you end up maybe scheduling meetings with?

Jiaona Zhang (00:47:47):
Definitely everyone on my direct team and definitely everyone on the leadership team, so call it those two combined were maybe, I don't know, like 20 or so people, 25 people. But then it was really about finding the people in the other functions. And to me, for any given function, it was really getting a read from, again, that leader, but also someone closer to the actual work. And so you look at the functions, whether it's product marketing or engineering, whatever it was. Back then I didn't have designs, like design. And really getting a couple of data points for each one of those functions. So if you add that up, that probably was like 40 to 50 conversations. But again, if you're doing them back to back and you're really synthesizing, you're actually getting a really good picture of what's going on.

Lenny (00:48:35):
And then the second bucket was identify things that need to be shifted, changed, flagged. I imagine there's also an element of trust and building trust. Was that a part of this, of how you thought about it? Or do you feel like as a product leader coming in that's less essential versus say an new PM joining it? A team as an IC?

Jiaona Zhang (00:48:53):
Trust is so important. Trust is everything. As a PM, the trust that your cross-functional partners have in you, the trust that the CEO has is you... It's huge. Trust is everything. And maybe here, I'll even talk about some of the mistakes I made in the first 90 days. I think I was so much like, "I only have 90 days. I got to go, go, go. We got to go." I was almost pushing too hard. I was pushing too hard for change. I think that's the tricky part that every product leader, especially if they're coming into a new role, has to figure out how do I gain trust and then take that trust and then push for change as opposed to push for change too quickly before I have that trust?

(00:49:33):
So again, it was a personal learning and I think part of it was really driven by the time-bound nature of it, but hopefully not everyone has only 90 days. So if you take that learning into mind, it's really thinking about your trust as a bank. It's like you're putting money into your bank and then at some point you're going to take money out, you're going to use that social capital, you're going to use that trust to go push for things, push for change, but you have to be thoughtful about how full your piggy bank is and you don't want to be spending when you don't have the trust in the bank.

Lenny (00:50:06):
What were signs maybe looking back that you didn't necessarily have the trust that you thought you did or you should have had?

Jiaona Zhang (00:50:13):
I think something, a product like Webflow is a very complex product and there are so many pieces to it. It's very difficult to learn the product in the first 90 days, especially if I was also prioritizing all these conversations with the team. And so I think that again, without the time constraint, what I would recommend is to be like, "Hey, every product leader has to take the time to really go deep on the product." Given the complexity of Webflow and given the time-bound nature of when I had to go out, and given the fact I really also wanted to build that social context around what is working and not working from a function working together? Not just what the product is. What I wasn't able to do was spend enough time with the product to be able to have all of that in my back pocket to be able to be like, "Oh, I know how this, this and this works because I've literally used it a bunch."

(00:51:06):
So you had to choose. And in my head I was like, "I would much rather understand how the team is functioning together." And the reality is the team was comprised of a lot of people with a lot of deep product context. So ultimately as all things in product, you know this Lenny, everything's a trade off. And so it's a trade off. And so you had to make the call of what you wanted to trade off. And the thing I traded off the most was that product context in my first 90 days. And again, it got me some things because I was able to have the time to go deep on the things I mentioned, but it didn't give me enough trust in the piggy bank around the actual product fundamentals or product, the actual thing we're building as opposed to the discipline.

Lenny (00:51:48):
So at this point you've worked at four legendary companies, Dropbox, Airbnb, WeWork, Webflow. If we were to just go through each one, what's just one lesson that you take away from each of these companies in terms of how it's informed either how you build product or lead people, anything along those lines?

Jiaona Zhang (00:52:06):
I'm going to actually give you my biggest thing across all four on the product side. And then on the people side. There are so many nuances also, and we could spend another two hours talking about each one of these. But I think just to impart my biggest high level learning. On the product side, it's about really understanding why people love you and not forgetting to invest deeply in that core concept and then building everything around that. And so I'll walk you through the different companies. So specifically for Dropbox, I think we did waste cycles where we would be like, "Oh, we see X happening in the market. Slack is really taking off. Why don't we build a Slack competitor? Or why don't we build chat?" And I think that it really missed this idea of, "Why do people love Dropbox and what do we need to do to continue investing in that so that remains true?" People love Dropbox for simplicity, for how delightful it is, how easy it is to use.

(00:53:08):
I think we actually went for a period of time where we didn't invest enough in just performance of our client. How long it takes for the thing to sync is a big part of the experience of using Dropbox. And so I think that is a big, big learning where it's really understanding that would've shifted your investments into doing that performance work as opposed to chasing the competitive space. And I think going back to chasing the competitive space, it's this idea of what is your alpha? Again, why do people come to you? People come to Dropbox again for all the things I mentioned, but also ultimately we have your files. So if you're going and building a chat product, that's fine, but really the best chat experience or collaboration experience is going to be more around your files as opposed to around just the conversation. So I think really understanding that is a huge, huge learning.

(00:54:01):
And I think that same lesson can be... It's very true for Airbnb. So at the end of the day, Airbnb is known for all the homes, the fact that these are homes that real people put on the platform. We spent some time talking about Airbnb Plus. When you are thinking "I got to go in and I got to manage the inventory and inspect it," you're almost like taking away from the thing that is what makes Air Airbnb special as opposed to leaning into it. We also spend a lot of time on experiences. We dabbled in transportation, we spent a bunch of times on other things. But if you really sat back and you're like, "What makes Air Airbnb special and how do you double down on your strength?" It's spending the time to make that experience of really understanding what's in a home so people don't go and get surprised. Making that onboarding journey for the host and then discovery journey and guest booking journey really, really great.

(00:54:52):
So I think that that same lesson when applied to Airbnb, would've in my head changed the way we invested and I think we would've gotten more returns, as opposed to spreading ourselves and then having things that sort of work but then didn't quite work. And then again, same principle applies to WeWork, what is the thing that makes you really special? It's the inventory it. It's not actually like, "Oh, it's so amazing that I get to use this key card and this key card does 10 different things." That's not what makes the WeWork experience special. And so again, if you knew that you wouldn't spend all that time being like, "I'm going to really deeply invest in the tech team, I'm going to do all these interesting things." You'd be like, "I just need to make inventory management great. I need to make it so that the sales team, the operations team, they have the tools they need to go out and get the inventory on the platform." You wouldn't do all this other stuff that's just not the core.

(00:55:44):
And then finally, even at Webflow, we are learning this lesson all the time where at the end of the day, people really love our designer. They love the fact that they can use it. It does so much for them, it's so powerful. And then you add our CMS and it's really powerful. You can design with data. So investing deeply there as opposed to spreading ourselves too thin is also a lesson. I think across so many companies this lesson around understand why people love you, double down on that and then whatever else you build around it... Because again, you don't want to also be like... You're not like a single product company, you're not like a one trick pony. You are going to invest in these multi products, but when you invest in a new product, really go back to, again, what's the core of our advantage and how can that be something we leverage in delivering a really great product experience for our users in X adjacent area or x add-on?

Lenny (00:56:34):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round.

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:38):
Okay.

Lenny (00:56:38):
What is the best advice that you've gotten that has transformed or impacted the way you build product or hire or lead? Does anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (00:56:48):
I can't remember where I explicitly got this advice, but I feel like I got it in multiple forms and it just really sat with me. It's this idea of asking for help. I do think about that a lot because I think there are so many times when you're like, "Oh, I'm the leader of X thing, everyone's looking to me like the [inaudible 00:57:04] stops in me. I need to have my act together. I can't be asking for help. If I'm asking for help, is everyone feel like I don't know what I'm doing?"

(00:57:13):
And ever since I've been people managing, I've been pushing myself to be like, "I know it feels non-intuitive to go ask for help when everyone is looking to for you to give them advice, but if you don't ask for help, there's so many times where you're just going to be sitting there with your problems. Whatever you have in your mind is just not the global best thing and you have to go ask for help. You have to go ask for help from your partners, your peers, even your team, even being my team, I don't know. I really don't know. Here's the guidelines, here's how you might want to think about it, but I don't know the answer, you know the answer." Going out and getting mentorship. I think this idea of really being able to say, "Be honest about what you know and what you don't know and ask for help when you don't know something," that's probably the biggest thing that I hold as a core principle and just helps me build better products.

Lenny (00:58:03):
What's something that you've asked for help about recently as an example?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:06):
So I'm working on our product strategy for the next three years. I'm thinking a lot about how do we really leverage AI to support all of our service providers and support all our users who come into Webflow and have a hard time sometimes learning how to use our product. And so I'm not an AI expert, so asking for help from the founders, from external folks, from engineers to be like, "What's happening?" Every single week I feel like LLMs are changing. What's possible in the world is changing. And so constantly asking for help to iterate on the strategy is a huge part of... It's happening every day for me and my job.

Lenny (00:58:40):
JZ, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:44):
All right, let's do it.

Lenny (00:58:46):
What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?

Jiaona Zhang (00:58:50):
I love the Design Sprint by Google. I also really Julie's book around managing people how to be a good manager. That one's really great. And so those are my more business side of the house books. And then we can also talk about fantasy stuff if you want. But-

Lenny (00:59:07):
Yeah, give us some recs there.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:09):
I'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson. He completed the Wheel of Time series on behalf of the [inaudible 00:59:14] author. He has the Mistborn series and so he's a great one. He actually has this... During the pandemic, he holed up and wrote a bunch of books and Vince was like, "I have a confession to make. I wrote four extra books." And the latest one is Tress by the Emerald Sea that I really love.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I saw the video of him sharing that news and he's just like, "I wrote a book during COVID" and then, "Okay, I wrote a second book and then, oh, I wrote a third book also" and it just keeps going.

Jiaona Zhang (00:59:43):
I think he was like, "I have a secret or I have a confession to make." And everyone was like, "Oh no, are you going to say that you have a ghost writer because you're so prolific?" And he's like, "Nope, I just wrote four more books."

Lenny (00:59:51):
What a beast. Next question on that topic a little bit. What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched? And I know you said you don't get to watch much, but anything come to mind?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:01):
I feel like every night I'm watching Sesame Street like songs. We don't do TV, but we do do YouTube songs. I honestly don't have an answer to that other than we watch the Elmo song and the ABC song with my three year old.

Lenny (01:00:18):
There's been a lot of parenting advice on this podcast with my child coming soon. And so this is very on brand. Before we started this, you mentioned the painting behind you is referenced in like Arcane, it's connected to or the show Arcane, which I imagine-

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:31):
Yes. I'm a big fan. So painted this a long time ago before Jinx and Vi were a thing, and when Arcane was made, both my husband and I were like, "What? How did we predict this? This is amazing." So it's a good one.

Lenny (01:00:45):
There we go. Some adult content. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Jiaona Zhang (01:00:53):
I do like to do behavioral questions, just really understanding when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate ambiguity? Is a big one for me because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. So asking a lot of behavioral questions around that.

Lenny (01:01:14):
And is there anything specific you look for in their answer that tells you this is a good answer or not a good answer?

Jiaona Zhang (01:01:20):
Yeah. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward. I think also looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path, this is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (01:02:12):
Awesome. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?

Jiaona Zhang (01:02:17):
I love... It's not recent, but I do love the SNOO and it's very top of mind because I just graduated my second son from the SNOO and it was a little bit like, "Oh my gosh, no more rocking of the baby." But I do think it does a good job of actually doing the thing and I'm also giving parents peace of mind.

(01:02:34):
The other thing I'm a big fan of, again, you'll see where my head's at, lots of child related things. Midjourney for your toddler is actually great because instead of it being absolute instant gratification of "I want to see a firetruck," and "Here you go, here's my phone." It's like, "Let's wait for Midjourney to create the firetruck." And specifically you can even tell Midjourney what you want. It could be like, "I would like it to be blue." He's obsessed with Jungle Book, "Wearing a fire hat next to a firetruck." And so you can actually create, and I do believe in the future, so much of what we are going to be doing as humans is literally what is the creative process? What's the idea? It's less about executing all the pieces of it, but it's so important to still be able to be like "This is the idea that I want to bring to life." And so I just think training that is huge.

Lenny (01:03:24):
Feels like you've just defined your three-year strategy for Webflow right there with AI.

(01:03:30):
Next question, what is something that you've changed in the way you build product that might be relatively minor that had a big impact in your team's ability to execute?

Jiaona Zhang (01:03:40):
There's so many different things that we've done at all the different companies. It really depends on the company. And what I mean by that is at a company like Webflow, where the tech stack is complex and where a given feature has so many different interactions, you're like "People depend on this workflow, this thing interacts with this thing. It's a whole platform." One of the biggest things we've been tweaking is like how do we do more of a tech spike at the beginning to be like, "Do we have a good sense of how difficult this is going to be? The unknowns? Can we get a little bit more detail on them so that we don't go down a path and be like, 'Oh, this doesn't make sense'?" So I feel like that that's a tweak in the process that has really made a big difference at a company like Webflow.

(01:04:20):
But when I look back to other companies, again, that might not be your biggest problem. Another problem could be like, "Hey, it's just so difficult to work with cross-functional partners and doing a little tweak in the process where you bring them in a kickoff meeting." That might be the thing that just changes that dynamic of how you work with teams. So it's really... I don't know if there's one thing, but it's almost like every day I'm thinking about small tweaks and process to make all of us more efficient.

Lenny (01:04:44):
Final question, what is your number one pro-tip for using Webflow and being successful with Webflow?

Jiaona Zhang (01:04:49):
My number one pro-tip is there's a lot of stuff coming out that I'm very excited about. I do think Webflow has traditionally had a high learning curve, and it's because we're a pro tool, we're a professional tool. We do really amazing stuff, so much power that we deliver you, but with that power has come with it's hard to learn. And so one of the things that I'm really excited about pro-tip for using Webflow in the future is we're really going to bring the magic of Webflow University, the magic of AI, all together so that you can just use and learn Webflow so much faster, learn webflow in the context of what you're doing as opposed to going into a different tab and looking for the Webflow University stuff. It's going to be in context to the product, being able to actually take action directly, prompting Webflow to be able to do things for you. It's just going to be so much easier in the future to use the product. That's what I'm excited about. We're working on it and it will be out in the future.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay. No specific dates yet. Yeah, you could share, this sounds like breaking news of cool stuff coming.

Jiaona Zhang (01:05:47):
Some things are in alpha and [inaudible 01:05:49] beta, but we do want to be developing it with our users and really learning is this the power that you're looking for? Is this thing that's going to get you over the activation hump that you've struggled with in the past?

Lenny (01:06:00):
JZ, I think we've made a maximally lovable podcast episode. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. How can listeners find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:11):
I always love feedback, so if there's feedback on the podcast, send it my way. Or even just what would you want to learn? Send it my way. And the reason I ask that is because I'm actually working on a course, another course through Reforge, which is around managing your PM career. And so really just... I've talked to so many people advice around their career, but if you want to reach out and be like, "These are the problems that I'm facing," it would actually really help me as I am creating this course, which is going to launch in a couple of months. And so I'm excited to... Find me there if you want to chat more and send the problems that you're struggling with when it comes to your career, and that would help me refine my course.

Lenny (01:06:47):
And that's just reforge.com? There's no URL yet specifically for that course?

Jiaona Zhang (01:06:51):
Not yet, but it will come soon. And maybe what I'll do is I'll post it on my website, which is built in Webflow, so my full name dotcom.

Lenny (01:06:59):
Got it. JZ, thank you so much for being here, and thanks again.

Jiaona Zhang (01:07:03):
Thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:07:05):

# How embracing your emotions will accelerate your career | Joe Hudson (Art of Accomplishment)

## Transcript

Joe Hudson (00:00:00):
A lot of the people in my circles may have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange a life that they enjoy, and it doesn't fucking work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
What is holding people back?

Joe Hudson (00:00:09):
It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling, or expressing. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What the hell? Why would... Why does this... You have this really amazing insight. The voice in your head is often telling you bullshit.

Joe Hudson (00:00:27):
What most people try to do is they try to stop it, and that doesn't work very well. I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day. One of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
You're really big on helping people feel joy.

Joe Hudson (00:00:45):
It's such an important tool for productivity. If you say, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone try to experiment with?

Joe Hudson (00:01:02):
Yeah, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guest is Joe Hudson. Joe is one of the most sought-after executive coaches amongst tech leaders and has worked with folks from OpenAI, SpaceX, Apple, and other world-class companies. Joe's unique approach to coaching draws from his spiritual, psychological, and neurological practices. In his intimate courses that he runs a few times a year, and in his podcast, he helps people create the life that they want with enjoyment and ease. In our conversation, Joe shares the two things that he finds most often keep people stuck in their life and in their job, and how to work on getting these things unstuck. Why the critical voice in your head is always wrong, contradictory, and telling you bullshit, and how to build a different relationship with that voice.

(00:01:51):
Why falling in love with your emotions is so important and so powerful. Why you'd be better off focusing on what you want versus what you think you should do or think that you need to do, plus a bunch of amazing advice on how to make better decisions, help your team run more effectively, and why a seven-minute daily gratitude practice will change your life. This episode is basically for every single person. It will make your life and your work better. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Joe Hudson. Joe, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Joe Hudson (00:02:34):
Oh, thanks. Good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:36):
It's good to have you. I'm curious if there's any common themes that emerge often in terms of what is holding people back from success or just living the life that they want, especially ambitious tech people, which I know is a lot of the folks that you work with. Are there archetypes of like, here's the thing, often come up most often and hold people back?

Joe Hudson (00:02:57):
A nonspecific answer to that would be a critical voice in their head and a relationship with that critical voice that is not productive. Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, "You need me to be productive," but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, "Oh, shit, I'm still miserable." Or, "I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:06):

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.

(00:06:05):
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com. These are awesome. Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:07:04):
I would say every single time the voice in your head is wrong. That critical voice in your head. To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, "Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you." It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out.

(00:07:58):
I see the truth that I'd be healthier if I work out. I get that. Should I? Is it really a should? There's another question. What makes it not say, "Oh, hey, why don't you enjoy working out? How do we get you to enjoy working out? What would motivate you to work?" It's not doing any of that. It's, "You should work out, you should work out." It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.

(00:08:46):
Instead of being, "Okay, stop doing that, stop doing that." Say, "Oh, I see that you're really scared and I'm right here with you." Or sing a musical to it or just go, "Eh, I don't believe you." As a matter of fact, I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day to have an experimental approach and say, "Oh, what's the relationship I want with this negative voice in my head?" Because right now, what it's typically doing for most people is that it says something and the person's like, "Yeah." Or, "Yeah, but I'm not going to do that, so fuck off." Or, "Yeah, that'll never work." Something like that is the response. What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
Oh, wow. I love this so much because there's so much that comes from this thing in your head just shooting you down or scaring you about stuff. It's so hard. I hear this, but it's so hard. Next time I'm, I don't know, giving a big presentation, I'm going to hear like, "Oh, something could go wrong. You could look really stupid or you could totally forget what you're saying." It's hard to really intellectualize, okay, I don't have to listen to this. Is there anything more there just how to turn that around and be like, just shut up?

Joe Hudson (00:10:11):
The shut up usually doesn't work. Experiment with all of it. To me, one of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you." Because part of the deal is that the voice in the head has assumed the position that it's like the boss, but it's really a little kid having a temper tantrum. If you listen to it, if you just dictated everything it said, it sounds like usually like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum, or it sounds like the way your mom used to chastise you or the way your dad used to chastise you or whatever, a teacher. It isn't, it's not logical, it's not thoughtful, it's typically not thoughtful, it's usually abusive. It's a lot of fear. It's one of my favorites, one of my favorite ways to respond.

(00:11:06):
I've tried, I mean, gosh, dozens of ways, and there's a lot of neat effective ways. I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, "Ah, fuck it." Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, "Ah, fuck it, I messed up," and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.

(00:11:48):
If you do it as an experimental thing, then you can't lose, you're just learning about yourself. You're learning about the voice in your head. The way I like thinking about that is people are like, "I understand the problem, but I don't have a solution." I'm always like, "If you understood the problem, there would be no question about the solution." If you fully understand the problem, you know the solution. All you have to do is really fully understand the voice in your head through a series of experiments and the whole thing goes away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
The advice here is next time you're hearing something in your head that you don't think is going to be helpful to you is try to respond to it in a different way from what you've been doing.

Joe Hudson (00:12:25):
I would be even more subtle than that, which is I really wouldn't care if you think it's helpful to you or not. I would just experiment with different ways of interacting with it. I wouldn't even do it as a goal of, okay, I want the voice in the head to be nicer to me. I would do it with the goal of just, hey, how do I learn? How do I understand this thing? It's a far more productive self-development. Generally, it's far more productive to learn, say about the river valley by walking through it, putting your feet in the river, going down the river with a canoe, smelling the soil, looking at the plants, than it is to say, "Okay, I am going to dam this river valley and try to..." You're not going to understand it the same way. You're going to make some mistakes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Amazing. The second bucket that you shared of what you find most often is the root of what's holding people back is the way you described is your relationship with your emotions, which I don't think a lot of people would think of as the thing that's holding them back. Can you talk a bit more about what that looks like?

Joe Hudson (00:13:31):
Yeah, a great way to explain it. For the logical folks, so in 2012 or so, there was a person who wrote a book called Descartes' Error, and in Descartes' Error, the whole idea is that I think therefore I am, and this person's like, "Yeah, that's the error." It's a neuroscientist who looked at people who had damage in the emotional center of their brain, and they just basically ceased to be able to make decisions. Their IQ would stay the same, but it would take them half an hour to decide where to have lunch or decide what color pen to use. It would take hours and hours to make simple decisions, so their IQ would stay high, but their entire life would completely fall apart. What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel.

(00:14:23):
You can see this just by asking yourself the question, how many decisions have you made to feel like a success or to not feel like a failure or to feel happier, to not feel trapped? There's these huge buckets of emotions that we are trying to feel and not feel, and we're making decisions based on those. There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue. If you learn to fall in love with all of your emotions, then solution sets become available that you didn't have before. If you are like, "Oh, I can't feel like a failure." Well, then you're probably not going to take certain risks. If you are, "Oh, I want to feel loved and I can't feel unliked by people." Well, then you're not going to say your truth, and then the world is going to not give you the things that are truthful to you.

(00:15:20):
I go into my boss, I say my truth, I get fired. Okay, I get fired, but then probably my next boss, I say my truth, I'm going to find a location where my truth is and how I want to be in the world is going to be acceptable. If I don't do that, if I'm constantly managing myself, then I'm not going to have that reality. It's really important, just for the decision-making part, how important emotions are to be able to fall in love with each of the emotional experiences so you're not making decisions based on your inability to feel stuff. That's like one, there's literally a thousand others. Most people, they feel stuck. They can have a big emotional release and they don't feel stuck anymore. When people feel overwhelmed, it's usually not the amount of crap that they have going on in their life. It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling or expressing. That's another huge chunk of stuff.

(00:16:11):
Depression is usually unmoved anger, is another example. There's so many levels in which people not able to feel really limits their life. Just one that's like almost everybody can relate to is feeling excitement is something that most people can only do for about 10 to 20 seconds. Most people aren't like, "Oh, I'm excited." If you walked into a Denny's and there was this person, a 60-year-old man and just excited and was excited for 10 minutes, you'd be like, "What's wrong with this person?" When we're excited, it's contagious. I walk into a meeting and I'm excited, probably other people are going to walk out excited. We're limiting just our ability to create collaboration by the fact that we're limited by our excitement. I could go on forever. There's so many experiences like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
What I'm hearing is the core issues, we're not able to feel our emotion, but there's something there, like we are angry or scared. Because we can't feel it, we just can't break through that.

Joe Hudson (00:17:17):
Not quite. If you have somebody who's experienced a lot of emotional abuse in their life, then they might not be able to feel the emotions that they're having, and particularly where you experienced the emotional abuse. That might be the case for them. For instance, if you had physical abuse and I put a quarter in one of your hands and a key in another one of your hands without telling you which was which, you wouldn't be able to tell me if you'd suffered enough physical abuse because you've literally cut that sensation off. Similarly, people who've experienced emotional abuse can often not tell what the emotions are. Now, emotional abuse is, it's a big word. Generally, people don't even like equating the two. Just to agree on terms here, when I say emotional abuse, I mean you were told that you weren't allowed to have a certain emotion. That's what I mean by emotional abuse.

(00:18:08):
Maybe you got fed every time you got angry or you got your love removed, or you got punished, or maybe every time you cried, you were made fun of. My particular background was that. It's when you weren't allowed to feel certain emotions, you were told to cut it off because it wasn't going to be safe because you're either going to get bribed out of it or punished out of it, or loved removed because of it or made fun of or whatever it is. That might be a step that one has to take, but the place you want to get to is where the emotions are fluid, where it just moves right through you. It doesn't mean that you lose control. As a matter of fact, losing control means that there's still resistance in it.

(00:18:53):
The way I think about this is that emotions are like a tube, let's say, and there's water moving through the tube. You kink a tube one way, the water comes out a little funny. Kink the tube the other way, it comes a little funny. Let's say you have anger and that's the tube of, and you kink it one way and it's like, "You son of a bitch. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." You kink get another way and it's like, "Nice dress. You crank it another way and it's guilt. It's like, "Why would you ever do that to me?" Then if it's unkinked, then it's like Gandhi or Martin Luther king. It's this very loving boundary that's set. It's this clarity of purpose. That's how I think about it. The idea is to get to fluidity, to unkink the hose so that all of the emotional experiences come out with love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):
I did a meditation retreat, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which I know is a big part of your practice and something that led to the work you do now. A term that's coming up for me is non-judgmental awareness. Basically, experiencing the thing you're feeling and just letting it go, not attaching to it, not judging it. Is that along the lines of stuff you'd recommend?

Joe Hudson (00:20:03):
Yeah, it's definitely a huge part of it. There's a couple of things that I noticed get in the way, or the translation gets in the way there. One is it's like, think about emotions as like kids in your house. If a kid came into your house and you're like, "I will be non-judgmentally aware of you." You're probably going to get a very different response from the kid than if you're like, "Oh, I'm so excited to see you. I welcome you in my house." The emotions feel different if you're like, "I am non-judgmentally aware of this emotion," or, "Oh, cool. Oh cool, I'm sad. This is fantastic." If you have that welcoming invitation. One of the quotes that I'm most famous for is joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions and she won't come into a house where her children aren't welcome. A very joyful life is a life where all the other emotions are deeply welcomed, not accepted, not non-judgmentally aware of. I think those are really great steps, don't get me wrong. If you can be in non-judgmental awareness of an emotion, fantastic.

(00:21:14):
The other thing that's a little bit different about what you said is that emotions do need to be felt. If you stop feeling an emotion, you have to constrict your muscles. I can watch somebody come in, come up for one of my coaching rapid coaching sessions. By the crease in their eyebrow, I can know that there's repressed anger. By the hunch in their shoulders, I can tell you about the critical parent that they had. The body takes on a shape that's based on the emotions that you've been taught to hold. You don't just by sitting there, well, it's not entirely true, if you just sit there and feel them in that way without the full expression, they will move eventually, but it might take a couple of decades. You can actually just move them. You can actually make the sound, move your body. All mammals do it. Like mammals releasing fear, they all shake. It's part of how we exist. That's also a really big part of emotional fluidity. It's not just being still and feeling them, it's letting the muscles move, making the sounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
For someone that wants to get better at the skill of feeling emotions, being more in touch with emotions, helping their emotions be more fluid. I know this is a lifelong practice and not something you would just hear on a podcast, okay, I've installed this. Is there anything tactically you can recommend to a listener of just like, here's something you could do this week that'll help you, along these lines?

Joe Hudson (00:22:40):
We have a free audio on our website called Emotional Inquiry, and that would be the easiest way that I would, that's a really good entry level first step into emotional fluidity. The bigger problem is that every step has a different thing. If you're in the not aware of emotions, then that step may not be the right step for you. Though, if you are aware two or three emotions and you can do emotional inquiry, usually, it'll open up a lot of the other ones. There might be a point where you really need expression, and so emotional inquiry is not going to work. Just generally, the emotional inquiry practice is a really good one. What it is, is imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad.

(00:23:28):
You're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad, and that's what emotional inquiry is, is a somatic mental experiencing of an emotional experience in your body and what is it like and what happens when you welcome it. What happens when you love it. What happens when you resist it. It's a series of experiments that you're playing with the emotion and observations and felt sense of the emotion, and that I find to be incredibly, incredibly useful for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
Just getting very curious.

Joe Hudson (00:24:06):
Yeah, a lot of wonder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
By the way, the quote you shared about joy being the matriarchy of all the other emotions, imagine people have said this, but inside out too, I think is exactly a representation of what you're talking about, where joy is actually, she's like the protagonist almost. I don't know if you've seen it yet.

Joe Hudson (00:24:25):
I think I've heard about this. I haven't watched it, but I think where you think it's all about being happy and you find out that you have to accept everything for happiness to really work, kind of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
Exactly.

Joe Hudson (00:24:35):
Yeah, I have heard about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):
Anxiety takes over, and then things don't go well. Something else that I've noticed listening to a bunch of your conversations, you do these lightning round coaching sessions with people, and so I listen to a bunch of them. Something that was really interesting to me is that a lot of people come to you and they're like, "Hey, I have this problem. I can't do this hard thing I know I need to do." Or, "I have imposter syndrome just keeping me from doing this thing I need to do." you're often like, "No, that's not actually what's going on here. I can see that's not a problem for you. It's really this other thing." Is that super common where people think they need to work on this one thing, and it turns out that's not at all, they're actually okay at that and something totally else?

Joe Hudson (00:25:13):
I'd maybe put it a little bit differently. They're living in a story that describes an old version of themselves or they don't see themselves clearly enough to be able to see the whole issue, and so they're just kind of living with a story that's in the past. That's a really common thing. Oftentimes, if I do that in a coaching session, typically it's because they're showing me right there that it's not true. Somebody's like, "I'm so scared, I can't do anything." I'm like, "You just got in front of a hundred people to ask me a question. Clearly, you're not so scared that you can't do anything, so I'm not buying it." I don't do it quite like that, I do it with a lot more love than that.

(00:25:54):
Oftentimes, I see that people's stories are a culprit, like how they describe themselves. A great way that you can really see this in folks is that nine out of 10 times that you compliment somebody, I really appreciate this thing about you, they're going to go, "Nah." Or, "Well, my sister is even more." Or, "If you knew me." They're going to do some sort of version like that. It basically is one of the indicators that they can't actually feel who they are. They would rather, in effect, call you a liar. You're lying to me or you're wrong than they would to actually accept the experience of being seen in that way. It does a couple of things. One of the things it does is it stops people from seeing themselves clearly. The other thing it does is it makes people forever want to be seen and complimented and acknowledged and validated because they're getting the food, but they can't digest it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Do you have any advice other than working with you and you telling them, "Hey, here's actually going on," for someone to like, okay, maybe revisit, maybe this isn't actually a problem to see what's actually going on?

Joe Hudson (00:27:09):
We have a set of five kind of what we think are foundational tools for transformation, and we do these free workshops on them, and one of them is question the assumption. That's a really great way to have people start to see through their stories. At the beginning, I said, "Nothing in the critical voice in your head says is true." This is how it applies, so typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If somebody says to you, for instance, if somebody comes to me and says, "I am an asshole to my girlfriend." That's their problem. One, you have to assume that the girlfriend doesn't want you to be an asshole, as an example. Two, you have to assume that you know what being an asshole actually is. It's not just what your mom told you an asshole was.

(00:28:04):
Three, there's some validation, there's another assumption, there's some clear thing that says this in the world. Everyone's like, that's an asshole and that's not, rather than what actually happens in the world, which is 50% of the people think that this person is an asshole and 50% think they're a hero. It's something like that. Also, another assumption there is that the problem is that you're an asshole, instead of that you're resisting the fact that you are an asshole, and therefore, it comes out sideways instead of really clear. There's so many assumptions in there. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away.

(00:28:40):
It's like, "Oh, okay, what do I mean by asshole, exactly? How do I define that?" It seems like a silly thing when I am using this example of asshole. I remember this moment in my own development, I was in Bodega Bay, out of all places, and this very good friend of mine at the time was like, "Joe, you're an asshole." I was like, "No, I'm not." He's like, "Why resist it? Just fall in love with the fact that you're an asshole. Just allow yourself to be an asshole for just a minute, just one minute." I stopped, and I thought of like, I was doing venture capital at the time, and I could think of all the things that I had done that somebody would call an asshole, and all the ways in which I was unattuned to people, and I could, "Oh, yeah, okay, I can totally see that I'm an asshole."

(00:29:32):
In that scene, not only in the scene of it, but as the shame fell away, oh, this is nothing I have to defend. This isn't something that I'm a bad person because of, I don't need to be ashamed of it. This is just some actions that I took. As that faded away, then and then over the next couple weeks, lo and behold, I became less of an asshole. It's a strange thing when you really grok that, that it's often shame that holds bad habits in place. Is it a problem that I'm an asshole, or is the problem that I'm ashamed of being an asshole? Is the problem that you're a smoker, is the problem that you're ashamed of being a smoker? Typically, there's so many assumptions built into everything that we call a problem, and if we look through those assumptions, the problems disappear. As in this case, it disappeared for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Wow, okay. There's a lot there. It connects to something I know you recently talked about, which is the emotion we want to avoid is the thing we end up experiencing a lot by trying to avoid it. What's going on there?

Joe Hudson (00:30:46):
Since I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us. We all know what it's like to work for a conflict-avoidant CEO or a boss, people get really fucking upset. Eventually, people get really upset. Decisions aren't being made. There's all this tension. It's never relieved.

(00:31:30):
Then wow, sure enough, the conflict-avoidant CEO is dealing with a whole organization that's tense and they feel completely out of control and the fact that they can't do anything about, so that's an example. Or when I was younger, it was emotional abandonment. My dad was an alcoholic, and I didn't want to feel that emotional abandonment again, and so I would get really hard when I felt like people were leaving me, I'd be like, "What the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah?" Which of course, made them abandon me quicker, or I would try to caretaker people, which would build resentment, which would make people abandon me. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
What the hell? Why does this happen?

Joe Hudson (00:32:14):
That doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
This is counterproductive.

Joe Hudson (00:32:20):
It is counterproductive. I think that the really cool thing about it is you can look at any issue that you're having in your life, so you can say, oh, one of the problems that I have in my life is that I am constantly in an argument with my girlfriend or boyfriend, let's say. What is the thing that you don't want to feel in that argument? I don't want to feel ashamed. You're getting in arguments because you don't want to feel ashamed, and that's making you feel more ashamed. What am I doing at that first time to not feel ashamed? I'm defending myself. Oh, and me defending myself is actually the thing that's starting the fight. You can backward engineer it to, oh, I don't want to feel ashamed, therefore I'm going to defend myself, which creates the fight, which makes me feel more ashamed.

(00:33:10):
Any problem that you're having, you can actually backwards engineer it and see, oh, I can solve that problem by just being okay with that feeling. God damn it, you didn't take out the trash. Oh, that's a shame I don't want to feel. I'm not going to defend myself. I'm going to feel that shame. Oh, yeah, then maybe I'm going to say I'm sorry I didn't take out the trash, or I'm going to say, I don't feel ashamed, I don't want to take out the trash. I have to defend myself to get in the fight, and then I'm going to feel ashamed. You can reverse engineer all your problems this way. It's like it's such a cool hack, but it's very hard. For somehow or another, it's very simple, but very hard for people to utilize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:53):
This is amazing. The advice is basically feel the thing and just come to terms with this is the emotion I'm feeling, and maybe, like an example, the asshole. Well, maybe I'm an asshole.

Joe Hudson (00:34:03):
It's what's required for you to love and accept yourself would be, and love and accept the emotion that you're having in the moment instead of resist it. There's that saying, what we resist persists. How do you fall in love with and stop resisting the reality on the ground? In doing so, it changes the reality on the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):
In this argument with your supposed girlfriend, say you disagree about her perspective on what's going on. I guess that's not the root issue here. It's your feeling, it's not her perception.

Joe Hudson (00:34:41):
Hey, sweetheart, I really hear you want me to take out the trash, and that's not my truth. That's going to be very different than defending that shame. The defending the shame is going to be like, no, it's not my job to take out the chat. You're trying not to feel the experience, which is what's going to do it. The response isn't the important thing. It's really where the response comes from. It's so interesting because people are taught constantly, this is something we teach in the connection courses that it's really not about the conversation, it's about where you're at in the conversation. For instance, when my friend said to me, "Hey, you're a dick." Here's what he didn't do, he's like, he didn't go, "You're a dick. You asshole. You're being an asshole. You're being a dick. Fucking stop it." He was like, "Eh, you're a dick, so what? What's the problem?" He was coming from a place of love for me, and so I could not be defended in my response to him. It's really where you come from.

(00:35:49):
It's the emotionally where you come from, that's the important part. Not as much what you say. You can see this, a perfect example of this is, this happens all the time in my work. Let's say there's a person who has a CEO and the person is scared of their CEO. Let's say this is the CMO, and they're, "I'm scared of the CEO. I can't say my truth. They're always getting upset. They're going to yell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I'll say, yeah, there's one person who says it though. The answer is always yes. That CEO has one person who they don't yell at, who they listen to, who they'll take the objection from, that they don't get angry with. It's because there's somebody who doesn't approach them in fear. It's because somebody approaches them a different way. Not with judgment, but like, "Hey, look, this is what we have to pay attention to." It's really about how you're coming at it and not what you're saying typically.

I'm very happy with what advice we've already shared and there's more I want to tap into.

Joe Hudson (00:38:04):
You keep using the word advice, and I just want to, so for anybody who's listening, do not take my advice. Do not, do not, do not. Test it. Experiment. Set up an experiment, try it out. See if it's true for you. It's one, I just made this shit up. Somebody else could make up something different. It's like Jeff Bezos made up Amazon. We make stuff up, but we're humans. Two, is if you instead of just listen to it as a soundbite, if you actually do it and make an experiment out of it, you get to learn. It's in your bones. You get to see what's actually real for you. What's real for you in this moment might not be real for you what's in the next moment. For instance, I could give the advice that says, hey, you can't even control your thoughts.

(00:38:55):
You can't even decide what thought you are going to have next is, it's just going to fucking happen. you're completely out of control, and so it's all a gift. Can you look at life as all a gift? Wow, that could be really useful for one person, but the other person, they feel so disempowered that they're like, "I can't even control my own thoughts. Man, I am totally trapped." They might really need at that moment to learn that, "Oh, I have empowerment, I have choice." That's the advice that they need to hear. Do the experiment, find out what's true for you in this moment. If there's a piece of advice, that's the one I want to give.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:40):
let's share more experiments people can run. Another is this thread that I feel comes up a lot in your work is you're just really big on helping people feel joy. Feels like that's the core of what you're trying to help people is feel more joy. Why is that so important? Why is joy so important, so powerful?

Joe Hudson (00:39:57):
I definitely would not want anyone to feel joy. I wouldn't want to push somebody into or like, "Hey, you should feel joy." What I would say that's a close cousin to that is that enjoyment is such an important tool for productivity. Enjoyment is such an important tool for living a meaningful life. Enjoyment is an amazing tool. As an example, let's say you drive a Ferrari, you're not going to say, hey, that's an efficient car. That's a super-efficient car. You're going to say, no, that's a fast car. Somehow in our own lives, if we get something done quickly, we're efficient, but that's not efficient. You can go and get something done quickly and then you're so exhausted. What's efficient is if at the end of whatever you did, you feel like you have more energy, like you're stoked, like, oh, I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. That's efficiency, is that you've actually used the least amount of energy to get something done. If you say, oh, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient.

(00:41:13):
Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too. If you enjoy running, you're probably going to run more than if you don't enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you're probably going to make a better podcast and you're going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. There's something really, really important about enjoyment because it's not only a measure of efficiency, it also has a strong correlation with hire in most things has a strong correlation with how long you're going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you're going to do, all of that. That's one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. I think one of the things that people do is they say this, they say, "I want to enjoy my life more, so I'm going to do less things, take out the trash, and I'm going to do more things like go on vacation."

(00:42:14):
That's not how enjoyment works. You can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That's a choice. Right now, somebody listening to this as an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you're going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? Typically, what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they'll settle into their body a little bit more, they'll relax a little bit more. They might physically get more comfortable. There's a thousand things that they might do to just enjoy the experience 10% more. That, and in that, they're becoming more efficient in that the quality is getting better in that they're hearing what I'm saying differently. It's just a really powerful tool. What I know the problem to be is that some people will go, "Okay, now I have to enjoy life. I'm going to disregard all these negative emotions so that I'm in enjoyment." That doesn't work. It's horrendous. It's just a recipe for shit stew.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
Along these lines, how much of the work is learning to enjoy the thing you're doing more versus finding something that you innately enjoy? Which one is more powerful? I guess, which do you point people to? Which experiments do you find people should run more?

Joe Hudson (00:43:31):
In our society, typically, it's how to enjoy what you're doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you're doing more, you're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. It's just an order of operations thing. As compared to there's people, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they're billionaires and they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange life that they enjoy and it doesn't fucking work. They actually have more power to make everything that they're doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn't work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, doesn't do it.

(00:44:25):
Whereas if you really learn to enjoy what's in front of you, all of a sudden, one thing that happens is that you're not as scared of enjoyment. You start saying, "Oh, wow, enjoyment makes me really effective, and so I'm want to do the things that I enjoy." You're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. It's just an order of operations things. If you learn to enjoy the things that you're doing, you're going to naturally start doing the things you enjoy. If you only do the things you enjoy, you will not learn how to enjoy what you're doing very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:03):
You show this tip of how can I enjoy this 10% more? Just ask yourself, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:09):
Yes, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Is there anything else that you find helpful for helping? Yeah, right now, how can I enjoy this 10% right now?

Joe Hudson (00:45:14):
That's right. It's not about changing anything in the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):
Got it. Internally, what can I do? What can I change about the way I'm experiencing this?

Joe Hudson (00:45:23):
Yeah. I like to ask it as how do you enjoy it 10% more, because if it's what can I change, then there's trying, trying is usually not more enjoyment. It's actually usually letting go of trying that creates more enjoyment. The phrasing can really make or break the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
Enjoy it 10% more. Say someone's sitting in a boring meeting that's really sucking their soul, look, they should ask themselves this question, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:51):
Well, should, they can. They get to, it's a great experiment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:54):
It's an experiment. Okay, perfect.

Joe Hudson (00:45:58):
The reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should and then you don't then you can fail. If you fail, then you're less likely to try it again. That's why the should, it ends up usually in stagnation. If you think about the way it feels in your body when you say, I should do something, and there's a stagnation, there's a, hmm. whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here's an experiment I can do, or here's what I enjoy, there's less stagnation, there's more movement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:31):
This touches on something else that you talk a lot about, and we've been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don't need to necessarily improve. We've talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there just how to help people learn this?

Joe Hudson (00:46:49):
My favorite metaphor on this one is at what time in the journey of an oak tree is it perfect? Is it when it's an acorn, when it's sprout, when it's 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree? Now, I'm perfect. The idea is ridiculous. It's a similar thing for us. The idea that I need to improve myself, it really disturbs the natural process that's at hand, which is we evolve. We as human beings evolve. If it's like, oh, I'm evolving and I can enjoy it, and I'm acting from my authenticity, then that has a lot of alacrity. That moves quick. If it's I need to improve, there's something wrong with me, I need to improve, I should do it, that all goes really fucking slow. Because there's a lot of emotional stagnation in that.

(00:47:55):
There's a lot of should shame. There's a lot of stagnation in that, and so you don't actually get that natural flow of life. The Taoist talk about this as kind of like a river always finds its way, it just always goes in that direction. We are naturally evolving. That is our nature. Then to put a whole bunch of shoulds and shits in the way just slows the process down. The other thing about authenticity that I think is really important too, is that if you are one of the few people, I'd say 10, 15%, who can say, I should be this way, this way, and this way, and then you do it, which is very few people can actually do that. What most people do is they say, I should do this, should do that, should do that, and then a decade later, they're still saying they should do the same things. Let's say you're one of those really successful people, then you have a life for not you. Then you have a life of who you think you should be, not for who you actually are.

(00:49:02):
If you move from authenticity, naturally, certain things aren't going to work, certain things are going to work. Certain people are going to work, certain people aren't going to work. Certain jobs are going to work. The ones that you end up with over time are going to be the ones that are right for you, not right, for who you think you should be. The most obvious of this is you meet a woman and you're like, oh, this is how I should be for them to love me, and you just do it. You just do everything that you think you should do, and then you get married, and then they love not you, they love who you think you should be. They don't love who you are. What kind of marriage is that? As opposed to, this is who I am and I'm going to be as genuine. I'm going to show you all my parts. I'm going to be as genuine as I can with you. Then if you do get married, you're married to the right person, you're married to the person who actually sees all that and loves that and wants that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):
How do you hold that idea with I also want to get better, I want to develop myself, I want to feel my emotions more, those sorts of things?

Joe Hudson (00:50:10):
I love that I want to, the better part is kind of just, gets a little bit in the way. We all want to, like a little kid wants to run faster. They might want to be a better runner, but the part that they missed, the reason that they develop so fucking quickly is because they don't think they're going to be a better person if they run faster. The idea is like, yeah, you have this natural want, that want is the thing that moves evolution. A plant is like, "Oh, there's sun. I want to move in that direction." As compared to I should. Both of them are human concepts, but the want, it's the thing that what allows us to know that's our evolutionary path. Oh, I have this want to be closer to people. Oh, I have this want for great sex. Oh, I have this want for being able to have a business that supports me.

(00:51:07):
These are great wants, and they show where the growth is occurring or wants to occur. It's like that's our natural evolution. It's great. What makes it need to be better? I want to be better. It just slows it down instead of, it's like saying that what I am is broken and therefore, the whole thing slows down. We try to word everything as more in the experimental framework, but also, we try to word everything as self-awareness, self-experimentation, self-discovery, instead of self-improvement. Because if you understand the problem, then the problem goes away. Just explore it. Just understand it as compared to making a list of things that you should do to get better, that you will eventually fail and then you'll just be stuck in this should loop where you beat yourself up and where most people hang out a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):
The experiment here that I'm taking away is think more about your want versus the should, and then things you think you need is okay.

Joe Hudson (00:52:20):
Because typically, when you say, I want to improve, it means the subtext in that is once I do X, Y, and Z, then I'm lovable. Once I do X, Y and Z, then I'm okay. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be worthy. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be enlightened, whatever the fuck, the thing is. That's just not how it works. What works is the person who loves themselves has loving relationships. It's not the person who's done X, Y, and Z so that they can be lovable, has loving relationships. The people who do X, Y and Z, so they can be lovable have relationships where people are critical and constantly telling them that they have to be better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):
Coming back, you just said this interesting quote that you also shared at the beginning. This idea, once we understand the problem, it goes away.

Joe Hudson (00:53:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
Let's make sure people understand what that means. Is it related to this idea once you feel like I'm an asshole, okay, and then like, oh, okay, and then it starts to kind of away, is that the core?

Joe Hudson (00:53:15):
I just mean practically. It's like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don't understand the solution to it? There's a principle, and I can't remember the name of it, like it's Strickland principle or something. It's something that this CFO that I used to work with said, and he would say, "Problems get solved if you spend time on them. If you just give enough attention to a problem, the problem will solve." That's the way it works in business. An unsolvable problem, obviously, it's not going to work that way. The reason that, that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it.

(00:53:58):
Another one, love him or hate him, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem. It's the same thing.

(00:54:47):
If we just explore a problem enough, the solution is apparent. If we understand the problem enough, the solution is apparent. Typically, if we come to a problem with a kid's mind, wonder, if we come to it, what could I learn here? What's exciting? What are the experiments I can run? Then typically, that's the most efficient way, enjoyable way to solve a problem as compared to, I have to get to this problem by this time and we're going to do it this way. Usually, that doesn't work. I could geek out on why that lets democracies win over autocracies because they're far more experimental by nature, and it's not one person saying how things are going, but just generally, just we're more efficient when we're exploring. We're more efficient when we're exploring ourselves and understanding ourselves and trying to improve ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:46):
There's a couple of more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:55:59):
That's similar to what I said before, which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. Let's say I want to have all human beings, I want to be a part of a great team. Nobody has ever raised their hand and said, "I'd like to be a part of a team." Yet, grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not A teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you're unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about if you're conflict avoidant, you're not going to be able to make an A team because there's nothing that is alive doesn't require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. A good team requires tension. If you're going to avoid that experience, you're not going to be as easily, if at all, be able to create a quality team.

(00:57:05):
To be able to look forward to any emotional experience, creates more and more solution sets for more and more optionality. In creating a great team, for instance, you need to be good with people hating you. You need to be good with drawing boundaries and having people upset. You need to be able to have high expectations. You have to be okay with somebody being disappointed with themselves. You have to be okay being disappointed with yourself. All these emotional experiences have to be available to you if you're going to find the solutions to make an A quality team. The more you can fall in love with each emotional experience, the more you have and then the clearer the decision making gets. That's one thing for making great decisions. The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by.

(00:58:06):
We all have a set of principles to live by that we're doing it. For a lot of people, those principles are what do I have to do to get likes on Facebook? I'm going to make a decision based on getting likes on Facebook. I'm going to make decisions based on whatever it is. Pretending that I want to get wealthy or trying to get wealthy or there's a series of things. If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success? Then experiment with them and then refine those principles and then experiment with them. Then there'll be these moments where you don't want to do it, but those are your principles, so you're going to go and do it.

(00:59:03):
As an example for this, one of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation? At any moment in running my business, there's going to be something that we don't want to talk about. How do we lean in and talk about that? We start all of our meetings with what are you scared to say in our business? What are you scared to say? Not all of our meetings, but some of our meetings are started with what are you scared to say? Because we want to embrace that intensity because we know that if we lean into the thing that we're trying to avoid, our life is going to get better, our business is going to get better.

(00:59:57):
If you can see what those principles are for you, and then run experiments to see if they work and then refine them every once in a while. Because of that embrace intensity, if somebody comes to me and says, "You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong." I don't have to think about what I'm going to do. I'm like, "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing." It's going to be immediate because I live this way. Maybe I don't want to hear it. Maybe I'm having a bad day. Whatever it is. Maybe I'll say, "Hey, I want hear you give me, I'm not able to, give me a day and I'll come back to you." all of a sudden, my decisions get made automatically if I live by a set of principles and very effective, I find very effective living by a set of principles

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:51):
For someone that wants to create their own set of principles. Is there a guide you have? Is there any advice for how to actually go about starting this list, putting it together?

Joe Hudson (01:00:58):
We have a decisions course, which is a large part of it is about how to do that. It's a difficult one to explain because there's a lot of nuance in it. Just as for instance, one of the nuances is defining the principles, not just by what it is, but what it isn't is a really significant, very minor thing, but it ends up being incredibly major. If you're going to do your set of principles and you want to do them on your own, the main thing I would say is keep it to five. I wouldn't even do six. I don't do six, but I keep it to five. I would test each one of them for five days.

(01:01:39):
Make your principle and then see if it works for you for five days and then keep on experimenting until you find five. When you look at those five and you say, "If I do that, if I live by those principles, I am just almost a hundred, if not a hundred percent confident that, that's going to create the life I want if I live by those principles." Then you have a really good start and make them simple. Mine are things like embrace intensity or connection first or everything is in iteration. As soon as I live by them, things work, company works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):
Amazing. We'll point folks to that course if they want to take it themselves. Cool.

Joe Hudson (01:02:25):
It's only once a year, so it's a rare one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
Oh, wow. When is the next one?

Joe Hudson (01:02:29):
January.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
Okay. Not too far away for folks to want to wait. Again, the two pieces of advice you shared, and that's our experiments that we can run to help become better decision makers. One is create a list of life principles, and there's a course that will point people to, to take that. The other is the thing you keep coming back to over and over and over, this idea of falling in love with your emotions, embracing your emotions, welcoming your emotions. There's also, I know you do a lot of work with teams. I imagine there's very similar advice for how to help your team be more effective. Principles, I imagine is a part of it, falling in love.

Joe Hudson (01:03:02):
We've run principles for teams, yeah. That's one of them. Teams would be more effective. We have a lot of, I mean I think I have, at this point, I have 12 things that I'll go into a company and do with a company. Typically, the way I like to do it is I will go in and I'll talk to the leader typically and they'll say, "This is what I want." Then I really want to assess. Typically, if the person who is a big part of creating the problem has a hard time seeing the way through the problem, or it wouldn't have been created generally. This is not demeaning any leader, we all have these issues. Usually, what I like to do is I like to go in and I like to talk to three or four people, see what their perspective, not just the leader's perspective.

(01:03:57):
Then I like to sit in a meeting or two and just see actually what the dynamic is. One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. It's particularly true in Silicon Valley, but it's really true in all businesses that all we are as a company is a group of people's relationships and ideas. Especially, like Amazon, you got a couple of buildings and some servers. There's not a lot of hardware there, and they wouldn't be useful without the people anyways. Anybody, whether you're running a farm or a shoe factory or anybody's successful is going to tell you it's all about the people. The atomic structure is what are our meetings like and how do we make decisions? I'll just really pay attention to a meeting. One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable?

(01:05:04):
Literally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great? It turns out, we've all been in meetings that are hard as shit, and we've walked out and gone, oh, those are great meetings. We've all been in meetings where nothing happens and we're like, "Oh, God. Fuck, another one to just drive a nail through my head. I don't want to sit there." What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, that's one of the things we'll do inside of a company is work with them to figure that out. If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface. Every single one of them. I had ten five -tar meetings, but these two meetings sucked. That tells me exactly where we need to focus as a company.

(01:05:53):
That tells me exactly where to look for the problem that's happening. It's the same thing with decisions. If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you're going to find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend and he's a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? He's like, "Okay, great." He's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to do this." I was like, "Really? Tell me why." He's, "My YouTube meetings fucking suck." That's not where he makes most of his money, but these YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better.

(01:06:39):
Luckily, there's a couple other people around at the time and everyone's like, "No, wait, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? How could this not work for you?" He noticed, oh, the team didn't, the content, none of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, "Ugh." He changed it. He was like, "Okay, I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to see what it's like for me to just say every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that's super enjoyable to me." When he did it, his YouTube numbers went off the charts in a very short period of time. It's just that common. Wherever the meeting is that sucks, it means there's something else that's a problem that needs to be worked on. That's typically how. I can just look at, usually sit in any team meeting and see at least three or four of the major problems that are happening in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
Such a cool way of thinking about where to focus decision-making meetings. I love that the story comes back to something you shared earlier with the more you enjoy something, the more joy there is, the better it's going to go anyway. The more you can find those moments and make things enjoyable, the better.

Joe Hudson (01:07:45):
The other cool thing is most of the executives or the CEOs that I've worked with, when they get to a point, and it usually takes them like, we always have the goal of a month, it usually takes two months to make sure every one of their meetings is five-star meetings. Once they've done that, then it's like, how do you make sure all of your teams have five-star meetings? Usually, it's like within two months and they usually have half the amount of meetings at the end of it. Half the amount of meetings in their companies are more effective. It's an incredible tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
I could see why people enjoy that if you were meeting as well. Is there anything more along those lines before we start to close out our conversation, either around teams or decision-making?

Joe Hudson (01:08:30):
I'll say for anybody who's running a team, Harvard has got a couple of these, but we used to do these tiny pulses. As a VC, one of the strategies that was really effective that I saw very few VCs doing was I would want these pulse, I would like to read the pulse of teams with these short surveys and stuff. It was the most effective way of not very happy, didn't want to come to work on Monday. They weren't going to make their numbers. The likelihood of them making their numbers is going down. There was this interesting thing that just about how Drucker, I think said it first and then the Virgin guy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Branson?

Joe Hudson (01:09:16):
Branson said it. He's like, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast," or some such. If that's true, then it's measurable and it can be a leading indicator, and it absolutely is. If you really pay attention to the culture on a team-by-team basis, it's an amazing, very effective way to drive results, but also, a very effective way to know when bad results are coming. What's interesting to me is most people feel like they can't control the culture, like most people feel like.

(01:09:52):
Most people, I notice, they feel like, it's more likely for me to hear from a CEO, "God damn it, everybody agrees when I get out of the table. When I get off the table, everyone's like, yeah, we're going to do it. Then they don't do it. Why aren't they doing it?" I'm going to hear that more often than I'm going to hear a CEO say, "Oh, wow. I really noticed that the way the email system was working in our company, we were disempowering people by not requiring an action after every..." I'm going to hear more complaints about why shit isn't working than I'm going to hear about strategies, like very gentle, simple strategies to change the culture. it's an amazing thing to me that it's so powerful and yet people feel so out of control with it

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
To give people something they can do, say today or tomorrow to work on a lot of these things we've been talking about. Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone should try to experiment with in the next day, couple of days or weeks, just to help them be better and more successful and happier?

Joe Hudson (01:11:00):
I would do seven minutes, no less than seven minutes. You can do more than seven minutes. Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day. It can't be, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this. It has to be feeling the gratitude and then seeing what comes out of your mouth when you're coming from the felt sense of gratitude and doing it back and forth. You're savoring the experience of gratitude and you're going back and forth with another human being. Call mom, dad, sister, brother, business partner, friend, and every day just express gratitude back and forth for seven minutes, coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly. Really, really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
Wow. I already feel it. The practice is you are expressing gratitude to the person you're with.

Joe Hudson (01:12:09):
It can be gratitude for anything in your life. As a matter of fact, I would say do it for a couple of weeks and then do it on the places where you feel lack. That's where the superpower comes in. In my own personal life, I was meditating. I spent seven, eight hours a day meditating for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
That's a lot of hours.

Joe Hudson (01:12:32):
You can imagine, I didn't have a lot of money. The joke I used to make is I would meditate and worry about money most of my day. It's funny, but it's truth. One day, I was thinking about money and thinking I was driving in my car and I was thinking about this billionaire I knew and I was thinking about how I didn't have enough and then I thought, "Oh, this billionaire doesn't think they have enough either. I know I'm well enough." I'm like, "Oh, I have the experience of a billionaire right now." I was like, "He's probably driving in a car somewhere thinking he doesn't have enough, and I'm driving in a car somewhere thinking I don't have enough. This is great. I'm a billionaire."

(01:13:20):
It tickled me, the idea tickled me. Then I was like, well, what happens if I start focusing on everything I do have instead of focusing on what I don't have? Which is where the gratitude practice came from. My wife and I would sit every day and just be grateful for all the physical stuff that we had. We were living in a hobble, were living 15-year-old year cars. We had no money. I was in debt. I was in, I think $40,000 in credit card debt or some crazy shit. We just did it. Literally, was it three months later, my credit card debt was gone. Six months later, I had $60,000 in the bank. Entire life changed because I no longer defined myself by somebody who didn't have, I defined myself as somebody who did have. All of a sudden, I could look out the window and it wasn't, "Oh, shit, I can't have that. I can't have that. I can't have that."

(01:14:18):
I look out the window, I'd say somebody made money on that. Somebody made money on that. Every fucking thing I looked at, somebody made money on. 20 people, 20 companies made money on the fucking lamppost. The person who installed it, the energy company, the rubber company, there's just, holy crap, it's all over the place. Then in that definition, all of a sudden, it became really clear. It doesn't matter if the thing that you feel like you lack is time, or the thing that you feel like you lack is love or the thing that you feel like you lack is money. If you can really do a gratitude practice on the thing that you lack, there's a superpower in that one, changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Do you still do this?

Joe Hudson (01:15:00):
I do gratitude, yes. Do I do gratitude on stuff I lack? I don't really have an experience of lack. That's not really...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:07):
You still do this gratitude, seven minutes?

Joe Hudson (01:15:09):
Of course, yes. That's like asking if I still have sex. Why would I give that up? It feels great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):
Just to be clear, you find someone seven minutes every morning, probably think about things you're grateful for and share back. Focus not on your intellectual thing you're grateful for, but just what's coming out of your emotional body.

Joe Hudson (01:15:28):
Feel the gratitude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:30):
Yeah, then gratitude.

Joe Hudson (01:15:30):
Let the feeling of gratitude speak rather than your mind, so that you get the felt sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Joe, I'm incredibly grateful for you. I really appreciate you sharing so many experiments for people to run. I think this is going to make a real impact on a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find your courses? I know you have a podcast. Where can folks find the stuff they do online, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:15:55):
First of all, Art of Accomplishment, the podcast, it's Art of Accomplishment with Brett Kistler and Joe Hudson, I think. Then Art of Accomplishment, the website will show you where all the courses are. It'll give you a whole bunch of experiments you can run. There's all sorts of really great information there. The other thing that we just mentioned also is just that we really want to make sure that you think that the courses are for you. The way we do courses is that it's a very felt experience thing. It's not intellectual at all. It's really in your body. The way we like doing it is that you bring real problems that you're having and you use the tools that we teach you. The foundational course for that is called the Connection Course. If you want to get into it, go to the Connection Course.

(01:16:45):
To find out if it's right for you, if you're not already know that it's right for you, we do these little hour and a half free workshops and it'll give you a taste of what it is that we do because it's like anything that's going on out there. It's people doing, they're like, "What the hell was that?" It's just a completely different thing. It's not like learning in the normal way. You literally sit down with another person and run experiments face-to-face with how you're being in the moment. You learn all this stuff through direct experimentation. If you find out it's right for you, you can do it through these workshops, and I'm sure there'll be a place where they can find out where to go for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
There's one coming up in September, I believe.

Joe Hudson (01:17:30):
The Connection Course is coming up in September. It's a great place to start. It's foundational for everything else we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:17:39):
I want my children to grow up in a fantastic world. The best way that, that can happen is that if the people listening to this discover who they are and their nature and the truth of how they operate. Not for them, but for their children and their children's children. You want to do me a favor and make my daughter's world a better place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:08):
I also just had a son, and so I totally resonate with that.

Joe Hudson (01:18:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:13):
Joe, thank you so much for being here. What an amazing podcast episode. This ended up being as I expected.

Joe Hudson (01:18:19):
Pleasure. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it, Lenny.

# Conscious leadership: Unlocking vision, strategy and purpose | JM Nickels (Uber, Waymo, DoorDash)

## Transcript

John Mark Nickels (00:00:00):
Get clear on your objective function, and one way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me because five years from now, I'm not going to give a if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters, and that means that the next action, the next thing I do today and tomorrow, those will translate into the relationship with her, right? Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed, right? We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. To me, an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Today my guest is J.M. Nickels. J.M. has been a product leader at Waymo, DoorDash and Uber. He's also an engineering manager at Groupon, and before that an equity trader at Getco. At Uber, he built and launched the very first version of Uber Pool and then went on to lead the team responsible for the infrastructure and algorithms powering the economic and logistics brain behind Uber's matching and pricing systems. At DoorDash, he was head of product for DoorDash platform. At Waymo, he led product for the commercialization of autonomous ride hailing and last mile delivery. And he recently returned to Uber to lead product for the mobility team.

(00:01:30):
This conversation is a unique and beautiful mixture of hard skills, soft skills, tactics, and emotions. I won't give away too much about the conversation, but this is a powerful one. Tears are shed, stories are shared, and I'm confident you'll become a better leader and human having listened to J.M.'s insights and lessons. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you J.M. Nickels.

(00:02:05):
J.M., thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

John Mark Nickels (00:02:08):
Thank you, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm thrilled to be here. Really appreciate your dedication to helping product managers improve their craft and up-level. We've done a lot of great researches out there for that, and coaching and development, as I'm sure we'll get into, is a passion of mine as well, so we have a lot of shared interests there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:26):
Oh, I really appreciate that. I want to start with a phrase that came up again and again when I ask people what to talk to you about from your colleagues, and this phrase is conscious leadership. What is conscious leadership? What does this phrase mean?

John Mark Nickels (00:02:42):
To me, leadership is broadly defined as having influence in the world, and so by that definition, to me, everyone is a leader because we all have influence in some way. It's not about whether you're a manager or not, it's like I have influence on my kids or my partner or my community, or the world, the way I vote, the way I show up. So we all have influence. We're all co-creating influences of each other. So that's the leadership piece. The conscious piece then is becoming more aware, waking up. To me, it's like learning more about my interior world, what my background is, my biases. We all inherit certain belief systems from our parents or our church or our community, and a lot of times they kind of go unquestioned and then they end up in conflict. And so it's really just about becoming more aware and then taking responsibility for the influence that I have. So yeah, taking responsibility for my influence in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:42):
As you talk about this, something that came up and something that I thought about as I was preparing for this episode is this idea of soft leadership, the power of soft skills and just how important that is in success. Is there something there that comes up when I say that? Just the power of soft skills and the importance of those in being successful.

John Mark Nickels (00:03:59):
Yeah, it's, what was it? Theodore Roosevelt, speak softly and carry a big stick? Yeah, I think I've evolved in that department. I think when I was younger in my career, I thought it was really important that we got to show up to the meeting and have the right slides and be the loudest, rightest voice in the room, and that's the way to have influence. And there's certainly a place for having leadership in a meeting and presenting a point of view and helping guide the narrative, but to me, yeah, I would say I've evolved more towards sitting back. It's also as I've become a more senior leader, I'm aware that there are power dynamics there. There's imbalances where junior folks don't feel as comfortable speaking up or I say something's not a good idea and then, "Well, I don't want to disagree with J.M."

(00:04:45):
So it's like, back to being more aware of my influence in the world. I really try to spend more time being mindful of that and say, I want to hear from other people first. I want to create space and I don't need to win the argument in the meeting. There can be a follow-up. It's not like this is my last chance to say something, but that's also more true when you're more senior because when you're more junior, it's like, well, this is the one presentation I have with Dara for the next six months. I really got to nail it. And so the pressure is a little bit different. Yeah.

(00:07:35):
There's a couple of threads I want to follow here, but first, I was thinking as you're talking, when people think Uber and people that work at Uber, I don't think they imagine people like you. And I know you were there early and then you joined again. Was that ever like a, "Is this a place for me?" Did you ever go through that struggle or is it just, yeah, I don't know?

John Mark Nickels (00:07:55):
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I would say I have been fortunate to experience probably three Ubers at this point. We joke about Uber 1.0, the Travis era, and you hear a lot about in the media the kind of bad parts of that, but there were some really good parts too. I mean, I think there was a lot of... Like when I joined in 2014, there was this mission of making transportation as reliable as running water for anyone anywhere, which is bold, audacious, and maybe a little bit pretentious from a little bit of Silicon Valley edge, but you could feel the electricity in the air. There was this energy and excitement like we're doing something transformational, autonomy is coming, car ownership will change. And it just like, feel, like my vibration.

(00:08:37):
And then, yeah, the good parts of that era were, Travis was a very great visionary product leader, and we started ATG and Elevate and these future-forward things and the way he would conduct product reviews, I learned a lot. It was stressful at the time, but looking back, I was like, wow, I learned a lot. But yeah, I would say it was not a very conscious leadership sort of place. You're right, it was like many organizations that run on fear because you can do that, carrots and sticks do work. But actually that's kind of how I found this work is it was in 2015 and I was a very junior product manager at that point, in over my head in a fast-growing place. And in these weekly reviews with Travis as we were building out Uber Pool, and I had a six-month-old daughter, my firstborn, and we had just moved to San Francisco from Chicago. So my whole life was in flux and it was a very stressful place, and I was like, "I think I'm going to snap. I don't think I can handle this."

(00:09:31):
And that's kind of what led me to start to explore this sort of inner work and meditation and sort of finding a way out of that. And that's what got me interested in bringing it to teams too, is because I remember I was in one meeting where we were working on this future pricing thing, which is rider pricing, driver pricing, incentives, and how we bring surge pricing and all that together. And it gets very, I'll go heavy, and we have all these PhDs in the room, some of the best minds in the world. We were able to hire people like Garrett van Ryzin, who was the foremost [inaudible 00:10:04] more person from Columbia and other people.

(00:10:06):
But everyone's back to lizard brain, everyone's arguing. They're like, "Well, no, I think we should do it this way. We should do it this way." And I was like, huh. As much as I enjoy the content of this, believe me, I'm an algo PM end to end, I love that stuff. But I was like, I don't think this conversation actually needs another PhD, or I'm not even PhD, but content expert. It's like what we need here is a way to shift again, back out of that fear, threat, righteousness sort of state into a more co-creative, collaborative, open-minded, curious, trusting sort of space. And that got me interested in pursuing more skills in coaching of individuals and teams.

(00:10:49):
But yeah, to your Uber question, yeah, the Uber 1.0 was crazy. Uber 2.0 was kind of like, Travis is out, the board is feuding, is leaking to Mike Isaac, whatever. And then Dara comes in and the peacemaker and then tries to stabilize, but the IPO is rocky. And so now I would say we're in Uber 3.0, which it's full pirate ship to navy, in Reid Hoffman's words, a profitable company. We're printing free cashflow, we're in the S&P 500, we've established the independent contractor model in a lot of states and jurisdictions, and it's like there's less risk of that model changing.

(00:11:28):
And yeah, I would say we're in an era now of Cambrian explosion of different types of transportation. The company really just built the UberX model and scaled it out to the world. That's primarily how we got here. And now it's like we're going out for all these different new sort of modalities, whether it's reserving a ride in advance or shared rides or renting a car or buses, and then different supply types too. It's not just contracted, we have a lot of fleets in the platform, we now have a lot of taxi drivers in the platform. You've seen we've signed deals with Waymo and Cruise and other autonomist players. So I feel like we're now at the beginning of another era of Uber and transportation, that the next decade or two, it's going to be super exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:12):
One quick tangent, UberX, a previous guest shared that the name UberX came from... it was just like the internal code name, UberX, we'll figure out a real name later, and then it stuck and no one had a better name. Is that true?

John Mark Nickels (00:12:23):
Yeah, that's right. I think that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):
Amazing.

John Mark Nickels (00:12:26):
When I joined, we were already scaling UberX rapidly. I joined in early 2014. That's amazing. But I did help name Uber Pool, Uber Pool, which I selflessly like to bring back. It got renamed to Share during my external APM rotation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:42):
Okay. I want to come back to the thread that I pushed us off of, which is you talked about, you made this really interesting point about emotions, and this is something I've been learning myself recently with having a kid and also a couple of previous guests. So you say that when you have... so you're in this meeting, you're stressed, there's a lizard brain kicking in. Something's like, "Oh, Dara's going to think I suck and it's going to really screw my career if I mess up this presentation." Your advice there is very counterintuitive, I think for a lot of people, which is accept that emotion. Because when I feel stressed and nervous in a meeting, I'm not, "Embrace the nervousness, let it out." It's more I'm just like, "No, it's fine. Going to be okay. Don't worry about it." Talk about why that is actually more effective.

John Mark Nickels (00:13:28):
Yeah, yeah. It's like my daughter the other day had some nightmares and she was like, "Dad, how do I stop thinking thoughts about the nightmare or whatever?" And I said, "You can't. Don't try to stop the thought. Just allow it. Let me show you why that doesn't work." I said, "Don't think of a pink elephant. What did you just think of?" And she's like, "A pink elephant." And then now she thinks it's hilarious and she tells her sister, "Don't think of a pink elephant."

(00:13:55):
But yeah, I think you're right. It is a little counterintuitive, but one of my first coaches actually had a great phrase, what you resist will persist and what you fear will appear. And so in my experience, this is another reason why becoming more aware of my internal world has been so important. I have more agency than I realized on the outcome of my experience. And so when I think a thought like, Dara might think I suck and then I have a thought that I suck, that can become a self-enforcing negative feedback loop where I have a thought that creates stress, anxiety, fear, and then that triggers more thoughts and we call it cognitive emotive loop where you're kind of in this cycle of thinking stressful thoughts and then having unpleasant, anxious, fearful feelings. And so one way to break that is to just allow it and not try to fight it with other thoughts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
So the advice is very tactically, so you're in a meeting with Dara, you're stressed about something. Just allow it, let it be. Don't try to pretend like it's not there or don't try to convince yourself-

John Mark Nickels (00:15:00):
Well, that would be the first step, is just to allow whatever's here, thoughts and emotions are rising. They come, they go, they're transient. It's not permanent. There's a lot of wisdom I think in the Buddhist lineage around those concepts. And then the next piece for me, once I can take a breath and relax a little bit, is coming home to the fact that I... and this is a little more radical for some people, I don't actually need Dara to approve of me in my presentation in order to be okay. What I'm up to over here is trying to force self-worth and self-love from within. And so we talk about approval, control and security. It's very easy to look for that from the world. Do you approve of me? And if not, can I control outcomes to get approval or get security and get the job, the bank account, the house, whatever it is?

(00:15:52):
But what I kind of woke up to at one point was that as long as I was going out there looking for all that stuff to try to complete something inside of me that was missing, it's like I was a hungry ghost. It's like, it doesn't matter how many Michelin star meals and promotions and money and title and whatever. It's like it's never enough. It's like you kind of enjoy it for a little bit and then you get back to like, hm, you know? So it's like a never ending sugar addiction. And so that's the next step for me is allow it. Yes, allow the emotion, allow the thought. Come home to, "I am okay even Dara does think I suck." And then also it's not permanent, right? It's like sure, there might be some high stakes things in life where you only get one shot, but for the most part it's like if I didn't do a great job on this presentation, there'll be another one. It's okay.

(00:16:45):
And think of it as practice. The other thing is from the fear threat state, I'm like, uh-oh, this is a risk, alarm bells, my career could be over. Whereas if I'm in that trusting, curious, open space, it's like this is an opportunity for feedback. How can I learn? How can I get to become a better presenter? It's like the feedback from others is no longer a threat. It's actually a gift. It's like information that I can use or not use to alter how I show up in the future and the skills I develop and all that good stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):
I imagine some people may hear this and feel like if Dara or Travis or whoever thinks I suck, my career is at stake and that really matters and everything's going to fall apart in my life because I get fired, there's stakes involved with messing up. Is there anything that helps you get past that and not worry so much about just this trickle effect of all the things that could go wrong if you mess something up in an important high stakes meeting or presentation?

John Mark Nickels (00:17:46):
Yeah. Again, and maybe it is a little paradoxical, but what I found was the more I focused on how I show up and optics and having a good deck and all this, the less I got promoted and then the more I dropped focusing all that. Because for my first few years of Uber, I was a senior PM and then I finally got my groove and started kind of moving through the product ladder. And it was really correlated to me at least, maybe causal, with dropping a lot of the focus on the presentation and how I show up and whether people like this or not, and just really focusing on the work. It's like, you know what? I am here to be a conduit from what wants to happen in the world of transportation and mobility and shared rides is one that I've always been particularly passionate about, so that's a good example, and then how can I get present and listen to what wants to happen next in the world of shared rides? And there's lots of different ways we can take the product and all that.

(00:18:45):
And it's really about, I want to make a fucking awesome product, right? And it's like, whether people like me or think I'm a good PM or presenter, as long as I manifest a great product into the world that makes riders better off, drivers better off, cities better off, less congestion, all these things, that to me is the reward. And sure, in order to manifest that, it is often helpful to communicate things, present, align, all those sort of things. But those are a means to a more powerful and transformative end than just my career. I'm tapping into a larger purpose and sense of belonging and identity and sort of meaning. And from that place, it's like I've just dropped the kind of egoic, self-centered focus on whether I did good in the presentation or not. And then yeah, maybe paradoxically, by doing that, it actually goes better and we do great work and it gets recognized.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
Wow, that is fascinating. To make that work, you need to really connect with the mission of the company you're working at. You really need to believe this is very important and very meaningful. So maybe that could be an issue for people if they don't really care about what the company's doing, it's going to be hard to allow for that approach.

John Mark Nickels (00:19:58):
Totally, totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:00):
It's interesting that you say that optics aren't as important. I think the reason I think about this as you talk about, a lot of people feel like there's the work and then there's talking about the work, making the work, the optics of what you did is really, really important. And I love to hear. Nobody wants to do that, but they always get this advice. So important, optics, how you share the impact you've done, how you represent yourself. I guess, is there anything else you can share there about just helping people relax about that aspect of their job and without being so critical?

John Mark Nickels (00:20:31):
Yeah. And to be clear, I do think it's important. It can't be all work and no optics or all optics and no work. There does need to be a balance there, and I think it does change depending on the size of the company and the level of seniority. When you're an IC, you're probably hopefully doing more actual work, and leaders are supporting them and presenting and communicating that work so that they get.

(00:20:56):
I mean, the optics does matter, right? At some senior level, you do spend more time on that, and it does have influence, back to the influence piece, which is like, how will I communicate an idea and the need for engineering resourcing and so forth might mean that team gets more engineers or doesn't get more engineers, or we do this project or we don't, right? Because at the end of the day, executive resource allocation is largely based on the, quote-unquote, "optics layer". So it does matter. I want to be clear. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but to me, again, it's more about that's a means to an end. It's not about the optics itself. It's like say what the Buddha is saying, don't mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon. And the finger pointing at the moon could be the presentation, the OKR, you know, whatever. And it's like, that's not the actual outcome we care about. That's an input to the output that really matters, which is the work, the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):
Okay. I'm going to shift this to hard skills and another kind of direction. So another thing that came up a bunch when I was asking people what you're amazing at and what you're really good at is strategy and vision. I had this quote from one of your colleagues, Brent Goldman, "J.M. thinks big, has lots of great ideas, will 'yes, and' to other people's ideas, will inspire everyone around him to be more creative, ambitious, and hardworking. He doesn't climb hills, he finds bigger mountains and will bring you there." So along these lines, say someone comes to you and wants to build these skills, wants to get better at strategy, wants to get better at vision, which is something basically every product leader is trying to get better at and every leader wants to get better at, what advice do you generally share? How does one improve in these areas?

John Mark Nickels (00:22:35):
Yeah, thank you. I appreciate the compliment. Thank you, Brent. That is a great quote. Wow. Yeah, I mean there's no magic toolkit or manual. I've long ago given up on the notion that I'm one book away from the perfect elusive answer to whatever plagues you in life. And there's obviously lots of books about strategy and you get into all that. I guess for me, a couple of things have been helpful. One is you mentioned earlier finding a mission that you're really passionate about. I think it would be hard for me to come up with a strategy for improving the healthcare system. It's like, sure, it's important. I hope someone does it and figures out how to deal with HIPAA and whatever, all this stuff, but it's just not for me. It's not my purpose, mission and vision in life.

(00:23:24):
And so step one is, am I working at a place and in a product area in which I have a tremendous amount of passion? Because for me, that is the fuel and the motivation that helps me break through to getting the strategy. That's the first step. So that's where I feel enormously lucky because again, this revolutionizing transportation and car ownership and what happens with autonomy and form factors and future of cities is something that I'm super excited about. I think about my daughters growing up and having a different world to live in that's safer and more environmentally friendly, all this stuff, and I get really jazzed when I think about, wow, the work I do could actually impact their future lives and other people. It's like, whoa, I can feel the chills right now. It's just super motivating. So that's the first place, just getting myself fired up.

(00:24:10):
And then the next thing I guess that's been helpful is I've deeply immersed myself. I haven't really jumped around between crypto and gen AI, this stuff, and a lot of people do that. It's great, nothing wrong with that, but I've been in this largely focused on mobility space for 10 years now with some stints over in the restaurant tech and delivery side, but very related in terms of last mile logistics. And so I think it's hard to come up with a great strategy if you've only been working in an area for six months. Especially things like this, they're super nuanced. Shared rides is another a good example where it's a super hard problem to crack and it's going deep on that for a long time is a precursor to being successful.

(00:24:55):
The other thing I would say though is people always talk about first principles thinking, but if there's truth in it, I think that's like when Elon's like, "Well, why does the rocket cost a gazillion dollars to launch? And there's no reason they have to throw away the materials and blah, blah, blah." One example might be, why do we need a 4,000 pound vehicle to move a human three miles? Okay, well... Or even a couple of humans. We do an Uber Pool or a Share, and you move two humans or three humans, even then that's pretty inefficient. If you think about just the physics there, the energy expenditure.

(00:25:32):
And that's where I think you might come up with bikes and scooters and little other things. And sure it's not always, it's raining or you want the car, but that's sort of an example of why questioning why are things the way they are, and then is the way they are super inefficient or not optimal in some sense? And that is often a doorway to opportunity to see, okay, well maybe things could be different. And so I kind of extend that at a larger level to the future. My general thing is just like, yeah, that's the mountain thing is I try to just close my eyes and imagine the future as far out as I can.

(00:26:09):
It's like five years from now, 10 years from now, whatever. And it's develop a really salient picture of what that looks like. It's like, we could do this right now, it's okay. 10 years from now, what could San Francisco look like? Or some city? What happens to the parking spaces? Are there still parking garages? Are those parks now? What are the modes of transport? Are there bus-like things that are autonomous that are connecting people to bikes and scooters? And how are people living? Do they live in the far suburbs even more because autonomy and they have a nicer house and they come in, or is all the space repurposed and actually it's cheaper to live in the city because we compact things, blah, blah, blah. It's not even about having the right one, it's more just developing some sort of picture of the future that gets you fired up.

(00:26:57):
And then yeah, you got to go articulate that and communicate it and get people to come on the journey with you. But from that picture, it's like, well, first principle, what's going to be true 10, 20 years from now? Well, autonomy is a given. I think most people would probably agree with that, and we'll probably solve it with just cameras and won't need lidar because humans don't have lidar. The cost of vehicles and sensors will come down, remote support will come down, and at some point it'll be super cheap and it's like, okay, I can extrapolate, that will be a thing. Separate from which player wins. I'm not saying I can predict the ecosystem of companies that will win here. It's more about just the underlying dynamics. And then that would be one, and another one would be sharing. It's like, well, a lot of people are like, "Oh, well, once we have cheap autonomous cars, everyone can just have their own super cheap Uber, Tesla or whatever it is here in the city."

(00:27:45):
And you're like, "Well, that doesn't work because then we're going to hit this induced demand concept," which is what economists call it, and you used to, when text messages cost 50 cents a piece, how many did you send versus now when it's free, it's in the millions. Same thing when they add a lane to a highway, the traffic just gets just as bad as before because more people drive and so forth. So if we flood the streets with super cheap autonomous cars with single occupancy, we're just going to have even more good luck than we do right now. Maybe we'll do The Boring Company thing and dig tunnels, but that seems unlikely.

(00:28:16):
So then for me, it's like, well, from first principles, shared rides is going to continue to be an important part of the future of transportation. And other modalities where yeah, back to the three mile thing, it's like, well, there probably will be various form factors of bikes, scooters and little mini golf cart things and whatever we end up building. And so that's hopefully an example of how I try to think about what are the likely things to be true in the future, and then how does that lead to a potential ecosystem and strategy around what we might build towards that future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):
This is great because this is something everyone can do, and there's all this talk of creating a vision, painting a vision, communicating a vision, and what you're describing is how to actually sit there and think about what it might look like. Sit there, close your eyes and in your head visualize in the next five or 10 years, what does the future actually look like? And do you do this in a state of if we were to do this product and change, or is it just even if we're not around, here's where the future is going to go most likely, which direction do you usually take?

John Mark Nickels (00:29:20):
Yeah, that's a good question. I think you could probably do either. I typically like to start with the former, which is just like, what will the world move towards absent of me? Just trying to pick a bird's-eye view of what I think the trajectories are and trends and what's going to happen. And then yeah, you could apply a lens of, okay, if we were to build product XYZ or have the strategy, how might we influence the outcome or benefit from it, or is it in congruence with that or is it rubbing against that and trying to change that? Either could be good, you might say it's a tailwind or a headwind, both are overcomeable, but having some awareness of the relationship between those things is good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):
And I think transportation, Uber, Waymo, in theory it might be easier to visualize that future and how exciting that might be versus a B2B SaaS payroll app or some photo sharing thing. But on the other hand, not necessarily, right? What in the future in 10 years, how are people going to be paid? How do people work at companies? I think there's an opportunity to do that no matter what you're building. Is this something you actually do? You just sit there in the office, close your eyes and just imagine? Is this more of an iterative process where you get with your team, how do you actually practice this?

John Mark Nickels (00:30:31):
Yeah, it's not like something you can just schedule 30 minutes for in the middle of your day of packed OKR reviews and random one-on-ones and meetings. It's like, I like to do it on my own at first unless it's something that I already have an outline for and I'm ready to move into a team space. So for me, it's like, yeah, can I get into a quiet contemplative space? So yeah, I like to go for a run and that obviously gives me ideas, or I'll go for a hike up in Marin and sometimes I'll just think of stuff or jot something down or make a voice note while I'm doing that to get things going. But yeah, the first step for me is just getting out of the craziness of day-to-day. To me, it's still insane how many product manager, leaders of all kinds just run the schedule of back to back meetings, 30-minute review, big meaty topics, you run out of time, run to the next thing, answer a bunch of emails, and then cram some PRDs in there. It's like, it doesn't work.

(00:31:27):
And so I'm a big fan of carving out time, again, first for myself, a couple hours, whatever, where I can just get out of the day-to-day craziness and get into that head space of five, 10 years from now. It's just a different place. So you need to transition to that. And then bring that to teams. If I have an outline of that kind of future of transportation in my head, I might share that with a group of folks and we'll come together also for some extended period of time. We recently had an all-day Monday thing where eight of us came into the office to talk about future of marketplace, and it was super productive. It was like, laptops down, we're going to spend all day together on a whiteboard. It's like a lost art. People don't use the whiteboards anymore.

(00:32:10):
But yeah, and then from there it's getting more people and then you can kind of iterate on it. It's like I had some vision of the future and someone points out something that is a little bit off with it or has a better idea. Then you move into co-creation. But I love that. It's like Pixar calls the brain trust. If you read [inaudible 00:32:28] book, how they come up with a Toy Story and Inside Out and all these things, is they have this group of people that just sits around riffing on ideas. And again, there's no judgment, there's no attachment to being right. They're in a co-creative sort of space where they're just like co-exploring and riffing with each other. And I love to be in that space with other PMs and engineers and data scientists.

(00:33:44):
Something I've started to do, which is hard, but I find really valuable is when I'm driving to not play anything on the radio, not listen to any podcasts, and it's so unnatural and it's like, oh, this is hard. I don't want my brain to just go... you don't trust your brain to go to a place that's fun, but it always does. It always ends up being like, oh, that was so interesting just to think of this idea that just came up. So I've been trying to do that, and that's such a simple thing to do. Just don't turn anything on.

John Mark Nickels (00:34:13):
Well, it's not really good for your podcast business to tell people not to listen to podcasts.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):
Okay, everyone, we're cutting this. What I find really helpful is playing Lenny's podcast every time I'm out and about.

John Mark Nickels (00:34:25):
No, but there's something to what you said, which is there's always a lot of content out there to pursue, and I've been in that mode where I'm like, yeah, more content, more... But yeah, actually similar to you, spend a lot of time now not listening to anything. Go on a hike where you don't listen to a podcast or music on your commute and see what happens. You might be surprised.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:45):
Yeah. And it always ends up being like, oh, that was cool. And that's where shower ideas come from and all these things. Maybe just to see if there's something here, in this meeting that you have, this ideation brainstorming meeting, is there anything that came out of that that was really surprising or new from a recent experience? Is there anything there of just like, oh wow, we really uncovered this potential wrinkle of the future that we really need to think about differently?

John Mark Nickels (00:35:08):
Well, it wasn't maybe a specific wrinkle, but one of the things that we're thinking a lot about, like I'm fortunate to be involved in trying to help develop and articulate a multi-year three-year product or even overall tech strategy for the mobility business at Uber. And one of the, I guess big ahas for us is as we move away from the, in some ways simpler world of UberX being the predominant product, which is it used to be pretty simple. It's kind of like a taxi meter on the driver's side. There's a time and distance rate that everybody gets, and then on the rider's side it's like, sure, there's some surge pricing based on supply and demand, but it's one product, it's pretty straightforward. And so this future of multi-modality and on the both demand side and the supply side is what makes the marketplace even more complex and challenging to build.

(00:36:00):
And so it was kind of all this around, okay, well now that we have taxis in the platform and we have fleet providers and we're starting to add Waymos and Cruise and other things, we have to have a marketplace that's aware of those different types of supply and which one might be available for what trips and how to think about cost and quality and allocation of trips and all that. And then on the demand side, it's like, yeah, we've got all these different products like shared rides and reserved rides and comfort and X and priority, and it's like how do we think about how to price those relative to each other? How do we think about which one's to show which user? How do you think about the ranking and so forth? And then that all has feedback loops into the pricing and matching itself as well.

(00:36:45):
So the dynamics of the thing, when I think about the future of marketplace, Uber, is like, whoa. And I don't think anyone's ever built that. That's the super cool thing about it. I think we have the best logistics marketplace tech on the planet and we built something that no one else has ever built, relative to digital marketplaces, for example, just different physical world requirements. And then this next arc of what I described of thinking about different types of supply and different kind of demand channels just adds even more complexity to that. But the aha was like, I guess, yeah, we got to think about all that stuff and think about how the supply and demand relate to each other and yeah, it's going to be cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:26):
It's just an infinitely cited marketplace now. That's wild. One last nugget I wanted to just reinforce that you shared about how to become better at strategy and vision, developing great and interesting and innovative strategy, and vision is going really deep on a topic. So you've been in the space for a long time. There's this idea that Paul Graham talks about, I think, called your top idea or something like that, that when you have... Whatever your top ideas, the more you can just think about that and keep that top of mind as you go about your day and just have one core focus, the more likely it is you're going to come up with new interesting ideas because your brain's going to keep working on it when you're driving around listening to Lenny's podcast. Just kidding, or going on hike.

(00:38:09):
So I think that's a really important point is if you're finding you're not coming up with a great strategy or vision and just having struggles, part of it might just be you're not spending enough time in that space, you're not going deep enough in the problem area. One approach is just spend a decade in that space. Is there anything else just comes up as I say that of just how to do that?

John Mark Nickels (00:38:26):
Yeah. Well there's also, that's at the macro level, maybe spending 10 years in a space, but at the micro level, back to kind of like defrag your day, don't just do the 20, 30 minute meetings on 20 different topics. Sure, sometimes you do that first and you got to do that. You have a large team like I do, obviously reviews across teams. I'm not saying I don't do that on some days, but it's like, yeah, what are my top few things, right? I think, you're right, I think it was Peter [inaudible 00:38:52] or PayPal guys talked about that too, going really deep and having a person or a leader really responsible for one core, deep thing for the company, and that's something they immerse themselves in. And so in the micro, that to me again translates to, yeah, I don't have a to-do list of 20 things. I try to have a to-do list of three of the most important highest leverage things that could have impact broadly across the company and then try this, like you said, let that one top thing marinate and chew on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:22):
I love that. And I recently had a post about all these productivity tricks, and one of the things that I find really helpful is at the beginning of each day and also at the beginning of each week, just write down, here's the one to three things that I need to do and get done. And everything else, I might have this really long list, but here's the three things if I get done, life will be good. I've done a lot. I've accomplished really great, important things.

John Mark Nickels (00:39:42):
Totally. I tried to do the David Allen GTD thing once, the super complicated organization system. It was too much structure for me. I couldn't do it. At the end of the day, what you said is right. There's basically three things that I need to do next, and then there's just some random backlog that I can just scan through periodically and that's it. That gets you most of the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:01):
It's crazy. I read that book 20 years ago at this point, and there's elements that still make things, like I leverage and benefit from. Even if you don't do the whole thing, that book I recommend people read because there's just like, if you pick a couple things from there, your life gets better. The things that have stuck with me, the main one is this waiting for concept of if you're waiting, if you email your designer and like, "Hey, I need you to review this product," just note, "Waiting for Dan to review design." And just having that thread written down and not in your head really helped me.

John Mark Nickels (00:40:36):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):
Yeah. Anyway, I'm not going to go on that tangent.

John Mark Nickels (00:40:41):
Yeah. It's the core concept of like, whatever steps you use. I think the most powerful takeaway from that book for me was if it's in your head, you're screwed because it's like you're trying to keep track of stuff and be creative and come up with the future of transportation and remember to pick up something from the pharmacy. It's a recipe for disaster. This whole idea of empty mind, beginner's mind, well, you have to empty the mind of all the to-dos first. Just get that out of the head.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:04):
Absolutely. I think it was mind like water, that's the one that stuck with me, where nothing you need to remember can be in your head. It needs to be written down somewhere Anyway, let's not go into a whole productivity podcast here.

John Mark Nickels (00:41:15):
Perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):
So we talked about vision strategy. So there's classically two problems people have with vision strategy. One is how do I get better at it? The other is just like, I need to actually get shit done. I can't spend all my time thinking about vision. You have a really good take on how to find this balance and you've seen it work well and not well, just vision versus execution. When do I go big vision, how much I spend on vision versus just get shit done, execute, execute, execute? What could you share about just what you've learned about how to find that balance and what you've seen work and not work?

John Mark Nickels (00:41:48):
Yeah, I think you can go too far either direction, right? It's like everything in life is about balancing the polarity between two opposing forces. And so in this one it's like, yeah, you go too hard in division and theory land, I've seen that go off the axle, early Uber where again, back to the future of pricing, it's like we have all the data scientists and PhDs locked in a room for two weeks and there's a beautiful whiteboard diagram. What did it look like? And then it's like, why don't we actually build this thing? And engineers are like, this is like boiling the ocean. And you just get wrapped around the axle of like, well, that sounds really good in theory, but I have no idea how to even start executing on this. So that's probably an example of we tilted a little too far towards the vision theory land.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):
And this was, you're describing the original plan to make a really good surge pricing algorithm?

John Mark Nickels (00:42:39):
Yeah. This was a plan to try to bring together, say how we do driver pricing, time and distance rates, but also we do incentives for drivers where it's like if you drive this many hours a week, you get a bonus. And there's also surge pricing and how to tie all those systems together in a very sophisticated sort of way. This was back in 2017 or something and it winged a little too hard into theory land.

(00:43:03):
And we still have that bias sometimes. We joke about marketplace, especially when we talk about with other teams that are trying to integrate in the marketplace, let's say they add fleets or teams with a big new product. And then marketplace people would be like, "Well, have you thought about this one random problem that could happen two years from now if teams become this much of demand and blah blah blah, whatever." And it's just like we do get wrapped around the axle on that sometimes. But yeah, so the future of pricing is a good example, we winged a little too far into theory land. But you could probably go too far into execution land too. And I'd say DoorDash in my experience would do that sometimes where we used to actually even half joke there, some of us leaders would be like, "It's ready, fire, aim."

(00:43:49):
And it was like, people would be like, "I'm just going to run through a wall. I have no idea if that's the right wall to run through, but at least I know I'm running through a wall." So yeah, I think it's about balance and can you adjust. Again, it's dynamic. I think there's times where you're in a soul searching sort of, "What is our product strategy? We got to pivot." Maybe you're a startup and it's not working and you want to think about... And then it's like, okay, well pull off the gas a little bit, ease up on the execution and let's lean into the strategy vision piece. And there's times where the strategy and vision's pretty baked at least for the next whatever, six months, a year. And it's like, okay, pedal to the metal. Let's just go execute. Let's get it done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):
I just went to this Acquired Podcast event at the Chase Center. Zuck was there, and the CEO of Spotify was there too. And there's two quick anecdotes that you remind me of. One is, Zuck talked about how once Facebook and Zuck and the team align on here's where we're going, no matter how many walls appear in front of them, there's going to be a Mark shaped hole in the wall very soon because they're just going to run through and get things done that they need to get done. And I really love that mentality of once we're sure where we're going, we're going to bust through these walls.

John Mark Nickels (00:45:11):
That's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):
The other is a really interesting value at Spotify. So Daniel Ek shared this. He said, "At Spotify we have this core value, talk is cheap." And when you hear that you think it's saying talk is not valuable, and it's actually they look at it as a virtue. Talk is cheap, we can talk and it costs us no money, very little money compared to building something. So they actually spent a lot of time at Spotify refining their ideas and discussing until they're really sure something is right. And I guess any reaction to that? Because I thought that was really interesting.

John Mark Nickels (00:45:41):
Yeah, I love that. It's almost a different flavor of, I think the base of saying of he's like, I like a crisp dock and a messy meeting. The whole Amazon thing, if you have the three-page or seven-page narrative, it's written with the clarity of angels singing from on high, at least describing how the problem statement or feature or whatever. And so it's super crisp and organized and well articulated. And then you might have a meeting where you pick it apart and you talk a lot. That's what made me think of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:12):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay, couple more things I want to spend some time on. One is you've worked at a lot of really interesting successful hyper growth companies, DoorDash, Uber, Waymo. You were also in finance for a while. I want to pick on a few of these and just see what's a lesson you took away or what's an experience from that time that might be interesting or helpful to people?

John Mark Nickels (00:46:34):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:35):
So you talked about DoorDash a bit. What did you take away from your time at DoorDash? What's something you saw there that either is like, wow, that's a really cool thing I want to do in the future, or here's something they weren't amazing at that I learned to try to avoid?

John Mark Nickels (00:46:47):
Yeah, yeah, it's really amazing to get to see different places and pick the best of what you like. And also the other thing is back to like, for me, there's no right or wrong, it's just differences have pros and cons. There's always two sides of the coin. So what's interesting I think about Uber and DoorDash is first back to the mission and the strategy. They started with different DNA, right? So Uber started with it was to utilize blocked cars at the airport that were not doing trips, but it was more about the riders. It was like whatever origin story you believe, Travis and whoever can get a ride in Paris. And so then it was about better than taxi and all this stuff, but it was very rider centric. It was consumer centric in that sense.

(00:47:31):
And so for a long time, I think Uber kind of took that too far. We got to the polarity of drivers are a commodity, blah, blah, blah, and they had to flip that back and start really investing more on the driver's side of the marketplace. But you look at DoorDash and it's like, Tony grew up in his parents' restaurant kitchen and the DoorDash thesis was how can we help small businesses be more successful? And delivery was just the first instantiation of that sort of meta purpose of DoorDash. And so they're much more merchant centric as opposed to consumer centric. And by the way, the consumer centricism of Uber that started with rides than translated to Eats. I think when Uber started with Eats, it was like, "Well, we just want Lenny to have some great Thai food and sushi and have some options. But selection is a means to Lenny having a great eater experience." Whereas DoorDash with their merchant focus is like, "We want every Thai restaurant in this city to be successful and be on DoorDash."

(00:48:24):
So their motivation for selection is, "We want all of the merchants to thrive and survive." So that happens to give you better selection as a result. But the motivation was very different. So the analogy I use is Uber is to Amazon as DoorDash is to Shopify, if that makes sense. Amazon has always been more consumer focused, Shopify is obviously very merchant focused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:46):
Interesting.

John Mark Nickels (00:48:46):
And by the way, either of those, again, there's no right or wrong, is a fine strategy. They're both great companies. And I actually don't know if you could do both. Is it possible to be Amazon and Shopify? To really focus on consumers and build all the merchant restaurant tech? And maybe with enough resources and time, but that would lose focus. So it's like there's a trade-off there. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:08):
Yeah. Like at Airbnb, there was always this, "Should we optimize for hosts? Should we optimize for guests?" And there's always this like, "This time, guests are most important. Right now hosts are more..." Make these trade-off decisions in the marketplace. So it's interesting that at Uber, your insight there is Uber is always very rider focused, and DoorDash from its DNA was very merchant focused. You also talk about at DoorDash, there's this mentality of just going before figuring out where to go. Is there anything more there that might be helpful, either as a cautionary tale or as a lesson?

John Mark Nickels (00:49:37):
Yeah, I think it's a balance. It's back to I don't want to deliberate and pontificate for weeks on end about which door I should run through. And I don't want to go to the other extreme and just spend 30 seconds thinking about what to do and just go, go, go. So it's finding that kind of happy medium. If I had to pick one, I'd rather bias towards running through a wall than not doing anything, because you still get learnings from that and you either make progress or you don't, and that gives you feedback and you can run through another wall as a result. So I think the biggest failure case is probably erring on the other side of deliberating too long without action.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:15):
What about Waymo? What's something that you took away from that experience as a thing that you want to do more of or something you want to try to avoid?

John Mark Nickels (00:50:22):
Waymo is, you've probably seen people in San Francisco, they're quite prolific now in terms of they're all over San Francisco and you see them all the time. And I'm not sure, I can't remember the last time I saw one towed, I don't want to say that they've solved self-driving, but they are obviously driving at scale with very minimal, at least real world intervention. You can't tell by looking at the cars how many humans behind the scenes might be helping provide guidance of the car or whatever. But yeah, I would say what's really interesting about Waymo is they've largely solved the self-driving piece, however they've done that, and in a complex environment like San Francisco, and you see them driving in fog and rain and puddles, and it's like, wow, that's pretty cool.

(00:51:07):
But I think what Waymo was learning, and I was trying help them learn is that building a self-driving car on a test track is a very different problem statement than scaling a fleet of thousands of cars. And how do you operate them, clean them, charge them, maintain them, and then how do you build the ride share network? It's like, okay, well we got to build an app and we got to acquire users and do classic growth stuff and think about that marketplace and matching and pricing and those are very different skills. And so it's like a warning that those are different things.

(00:51:41):
And trying to hire for that and build culture around that was hard, honestly. It's just like you're kind of a different thing than the host organism. Most of the host organism is just obsessed with perception and planning and all the core autonomy pieces and you're like, the commercialization people there, "Well, now we've going to make money with this thing." That's why I think that's an example where your overall vision would say Waymo is to build Waymo One. Just be mindful that it's more than just one. There's multiple pillars of that. There's the self-driving piece, there's getting a lot of cars at scale, financing them, operating the fleet, getting the demand, filling the cars with people, and then it has to all come together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):
Right. Yeah. It's so interesting that your title is Lead Product for Commercialization of Autonomous Ride Hailing at Waymo, and now it's come full circle where at Uber, that's going to be in a sense the way that people call Waymo. And so it's so interesting that you've seen both sides of this.

John Mark Nickels (00:52:50):
Yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. I think Uber, it got out of the autonomy business when it divested Autonomous Technologies Group or Advanced Technologies Group. And right now our stated strategy is to be an aggregator. So it's like, we are partnering with Waymo, with Cruise, Motional, others in China, et cetera. And then the idea is to have every vehicle on the platform really, right? Autonomous or not. And then use the power of the platform, we have this big demand base, we have a lot of riders.

(00:53:22):
And so I think what you're seeing is, Waymo and Cruise and others are like, "Okay, now that we've developed autonomy, what's the path to profitability for us?" And so they can go it alone and try to build a ride-share network. And Waymo is doing that with Waymo One, but it turns out it takes a while. It's funny, I feel like engineers too are always skeptical of why other people's engineering problems take so much work. There'd be engineers at Waymo would be like, "Why does Uber have so many thousands of engineers? How hard can it be to build a ride-share app?"

(00:53:59):
But when you look at what made Uber successful, what we've been perfecting for the last decade, A, the marketplace tech that I alluded to earlier, but also how we manage a large rider base and doing rider support and driver support and logistics and all of the helping finance electric vehicles and working with regulators and cities and making sure we have safe and accessible pickup points and on and on and on. And those are all the depth of the iceberg that you don't really realize or think of when you're like, "Oh, I can just build a ride-share app." Right? Tesla publishes their sigma design and some earnings report and everyone goes crazy like, "Wow, okay, well I don't want to bet against Elon because that sounds scary," but there is more to it than just the app and the autonomy.

(00:54:46):
So yeah, I think these companies will have an interesting question. Do they go alone, build their own ride-share network to capture all the value, or do they say, "Well, I could just work with Uber and have a faster path to high utilization of the vehicles," which unlocks financing and more vehicles and that gets them to scale faster? And so if you look at the landscape right now, it's a bit of both, right? Waymo is obviously working with Uber in Phoenix and we just announced Cruise will come back to some city next year I think, but Waymo is also still building their own thing, so they're kind of hedging their bets at the moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:18):
I want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call Contrarian Corner. I feel like you're going to have a good answer here. What's something that you believe that most other people don't believe?

John Mark Nickels (00:55:32):
One is back to being aware of your internal state and allowing emotions and thoughts is... Emotions in the workplace, a lot of people have the thing of like, "Well, there's no need for emotion in the workplace. We're going to be logical. We're going to be data-driven. Keep your feelings at home. Just show up and presentation J.M. Mode." And I guess in my experience, there's this thing around whole body intelligence and whole body, yes, which is yes, there is signal from the head and logic and data and left brain reasoning are amazing and it could be great, but there's also heart and gut. And to me, what is an emotion? It's just energy moving on the body. Often it's correlated with a thought too as well. I might have a thought that creates fear and so forth.

(00:56:23):
But to me there's wisdom in emotion and I can start to access noticing them more. Like where do I feel sadness in the body? I notice I feel fear in the kind of center of my chest, and then sadness is like a sinking feeling in my stomach. And I notice when I'm angry, my jaw gets tight and my eyes furrow a little bit. And so those are common ones, but you may have your own little signatures of you pick up where is joy, where is creative energy? Where is fear or sadness, anger? And then noticing those in a meeting or in a conversation or review. And actually if you're willing, even just voice it to other people, that's like the next step. But start with just acknowledging it to yourself.

(00:57:02):
And so for me, the wisdom of emotions is fear is something wants to be paid attention to. There can be the saber-toothed tiger is not really Dara disapproving of me, whatever. I shouldn't be afraid of that. But there are times where fear is applicable. There might be fear around, let's say back at Waymo, you want to be really intentional about safety and you want to be super... That's one of the things I love about Waymo is they're very committed to having a super strong safety record. And so there might be fear around did we really consider all the edge cases of what might happen if a dog runs in the street or a ball or child or whatever, and you might see wow, fear. It's great. The wisdom of that is something wants to be paid attention to and listened to. Okay, great.

(00:57:46):
Sadness for me is something wants to be let go of. There's a mourning, there's a letting go of I had an idea or vision for the future that will no longer be because whatever, something happened, other people don't want to do it, this or that. But it could be a vision of a relationship, it could be a vision of what you thought your life would look like, whatever. We all go through those sorts of things.

(00:58:07):
And there might be micro-moments of sadness of like, wow, that feature didn't work. It's like I really wanted it to be successful. I just let go of that, welcome the sadness. Anger to me is something is not of service to me or my people or my mission or whatever I'm up to. And so again, that can be a great signal to like, okay, I pay attention to that. I want to change something. And then joy is something that wants to be celebrated. We had a great win. We nailed the OKR, we had a great product launch. A lot of times we spend too much time moving back into the next, okay, let's set another goal. It's like, it's okay to stop and celebrate.

(00:58:45):
And then creative energy is something wants to be born into the world. It's like it's almost like I'm going to birth an idea or a vision or some new product thing and then just tuning into that. So yeah, I would say welcome emotions, maybe even talk about them, god forbid, in the workplace. Imagine that instead of having a OKR review where you're behind target and everyone's blaming other people, and you could tell when it's kind of fearful, if someone was just like, "Wow, I noticed that I just feel fear around this." Everyone was like, "Wow, I feel fear too." That would just totally change the tone of the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):
The advice here is bring your emotions into work. Don't let emotions... What most people believe is leave your emotions at home, don't bring your emotions into the workplace, and what you've found is they actually can make you more effective and make your teams more effective. And you even talked about it helps you make decisions in a more intelligent way because your gut and lizard brain almost tells you things that you should pay attention to.

John Mark Nickels (00:59:46):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):
I love that. Okay, so I'm going to close with a question that is rooted in something that you shared with me when we were chatting about this podcast that I think is going to be helpful to a lot of people. What have you found to be keys to a successful, impactful, rich, fun life?

John Mark Nickels (01:00:05):
It's a great question, and I think lots of people have different prescriptions for that, and I don't claim to have the one truth around that, but the first thing I would say as a meta observation is I spend a lot of time thinking about objective functions. We design algorithms to do matching and pricing and think about short-term effects and long-term effects. And so I really am ingrained in this idea of we have an objective function for our life. And then the problem is that a lot of us aren't conscious of it. It's just like an implied OF that you inherited values from your church or community or what your parents valued or what you learned to be good at, and I do this for work and blah, blah, blah, and I'm just kind of bobbing along.

(01:00:49):
That's why I love Ray Dalio's principle thing where it's like, Hey, write down your values and your principles and get clear on what they are. Or Clayton Christensen wrote a great book that he's less known for, he's obviously known for Innovator's Dilemma, but he wrote a book called How Will You Measure Your Life? And he was trying to answer this question of, he teaches whatever, MBA students at Harvard, and he's like, "Wow, all these executives are super successful. They're like Fortune 500 execs. They're most super successful, but they're all divorced and their kids hate them and their personal lives are a mess. What's happening?" And so one of the key insights he comes to is like, it's Sunday night and you have the choice of playing with your daughter, or you're reading a book or playing a game, and you have a presentation to Dara on Monday. And he's like, "Well, I could make those slides a little bit better and I could go practice or knock out some emails," or whatever it is you want to do.

(01:01:49):
And so what he basically found was the type A exec, successful people are very short-term OF driven. They're like, "Well, presentation's tomorrow, and that can either go great or okay based on Sunday night." Whereas like, "My daughter will be here, I'll play with her next week." And the problem is that he's getting in this cycle where it's like, okay, you start working every Sunday night and then years and years go by and suddenly you don't have a relationship with your daughter who's now a teenager.

(01:02:16):
But I think we're just not conscious of that. So to me, the first piece of advice would be get clear on your objective function. And one way that I've gotten clear on it is trying to think about it from future me. Because five years from now, I'm not going to give a shit if I made the presentation slightly better, but I'm going to care a lot about what kind of relationship I have with my daughters. And that means that the next action, the next thing I do today and tomorrow, those will translate into the relationship with her. And I think a lot of us aren't just tuned into that.

(01:02:49):
I love the stoic stuff, being mindful of death, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, all those great ones. Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. And we try to avoid that and we try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed. We mostly manage to just go live our life and eat ice cream and go to work and go on vacation and do what we do. And that can lead us to doing things that ultimately don't matter in the long run, and focusing on the wrong things.

(01:03:28):
And so to me, it's like an awareness and mindfulness that our lives will come to an end punctuates reality in a way that requires me to rethink my priorities, stop wasting time on things that don't matter with people who matter. This relationship, this journey, it will come to an end. I'm actually tearing up and feeling tingly just saying that. It's like even right now, come back to it. How am I going to spend my afternoon? Am I going to hug my daughters? Am I going to spend time with them after work or am I going to do email all night? What would I wish I had done when I'm in my last breath?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):
There's a quote that I heard once that really stuck with me that I think is going to hit a lot of people really hard, which is that the only people that will remember you working late every night is your kids.

John Mark Nickels (01:04:32):
Wow. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):
Yeah. An important reminder. J.M., we've covered a lot of stuff. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave listeners with? Or we're going to have a lightning round coming up, but before we get that, we ended on a really powerful, impactful note. Is there anything else along these lines that you think might be helpful for people that you want to leave them with?

John Mark Nickels (01:05:01):
The one thing I'd encourage folks to do out of all of these we talked about is to see if you'd be willing to commit to breaking out of victim consciousness and mentality. And it's not to say there aren't victims in the world, there are real injustices and things happening, but most of us, I've experienced, I often can fall into the trap of living my life at the effect of, right? I'm at the effect of other people and what they do. I'm at the effect of circumstances like COVID or Trump or whatever. I'm at the effect of the conditions and circumstances of life, and I feel like life is happening to me.

(01:05:39):
And so to me, the most empowering and radical transformation that I've been able to cultivate and develop is shifting from that to a state of I I am willing to take responsibility for how I see the world. And I may not be able to change the weather or the election or all that, but I can change how I'm being in relationship to it and choose to see it as a growth opportunity, as learning, how am I co-creating it, even things that I play a small part in, injustice in the world, how am I perpetuating that and being willing to see the world as I'm the painter of my existence?

(01:06:11):
I think Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is probably the best example of that. He's in a super oppressive situation that is very horrific and tragic, and the way he described his relationship with the people in the camp and the guards, and he given he gave a talk after he was free, the amount of compassion and empathy he had for his oppressors was just amazing. So I'm like, well, if he can do that in the face of those conditions, I can show up differently in a product review or in a conversation with my partner or meeting or whatever it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:46):
Yeah, I think just that skill alone is such a powerful unlock for a lot of people instead of, here's all the things that I don't have and here's all the things that are setting you back and all the things that are hard for me versus other people. Shifting to, I need to take responsibility for my own success and no one else will. And just taking agency is a really powerful thing. It's easier said than done. There's a lot of hardships. People have a lot of things that they don't have that other people have that are hurting their career and hurting their ability to be successful, but still, the more you can take responsibility and have agency and the less you have this victim mentality, I 1,000% agree, there's so much power there. So that's an awesome lesson to end on. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round jam. Are you ready?

John Mark Nickels (01:07:34):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:35):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

John Mark Nickels (01:07:41):
In the realm of the soft skills and conscious leadership, the best one is the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership by Diana Chapman and Jim Dethmer. And those were my early coaches and teachers almost 10 years ago, and Diana is still my coach. So I think that's a fantastic book that we'll go into more detail about some of the things we talked about around fear and threat versus trust and drawing a triangle and all that great stuff. That'd be one that I'd definitely recommend first. Another one more in the content world is I think you had Nancy Duarte on your podcast one point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):
Yeah, Nancy Duarte. Yeah.

John Mark Nickels (01:08:17):
Or Duarte, sorry. I love her book Resonate. I know she has some other ones too, on slide design and stuff. But what was so cool about that, I gave it to PMs all the time when I'm trying to help them develop their communication, storytelling, and presentation skills. And she goes through those TED talks and Martin Luther King, I have a dream, and going to the Moon, and basically make the spark line against it to understand this concept of resonance with the audience. It's actually a great skill for, back to vision and north-starring, she said what all these things do is they alternate tension between the world as it is and the world as it might be. And it's like, here's that beautiful future of transportation, San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, but here's why it sucks today, all these problems and this and that, but here's how it could look in a few years.

(01:09:05):
And then you're creating that tension and the audience at the end is like sweaty palms and like, "I want to help build that future." What do you need? You need money, you need time, resources, join your company. Great. So anyway, Resonate, Nancy Duarte, great book. Those would be some of the top two that I recommend. There's not one specific book, but I really love Alan Watts' books if you're into... He was one of the first people to articulate and kind of import Buddhism and that sort of Eastern thinking into the West, and he just has a very satirical, comical sort of not taking myself too seriously style and just like the way he explains a lot of those concepts. So that'd be another one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):
He also has an amazing voice if you listen to recordings of him with music, it's just so fun to listen to.

John Mark Nickels (01:09:52):
Totally. Actually, Sam Harris's Waking Up app now has the entire... he worked with I think Alan Watts' son. So the Waking Up app has all 80 or 100 hours of recorded Alan Watts lectures.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):
Oh my god. There's YouTube videos.

John Mark Nickels (01:10:06):
[inaudible 01:10:06]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):
There's some awesome YouTube videos of him that are worth watching, we'll link to some of those. And then Nancy Duarte, she shared exactly that lesson on the podcast that we had together. So if you don't want to read the book and listen to her give this tactic of this way to communicate a vision, you can listen to that episode, we'll link to it. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you have really enjoyed?

John Mark Nickels (01:10:28):
Yeah. The last movie I really enjoyed was Inside Out 2 with my kids, which is very-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:34):
I could see why you'd love that.

John Mark Nickels (01:10:36):
Yes, consistent with the emotional awareness and allowing the different emotional parts and don't want to spoil the movie, maybe everyone hasn't seen it, but it's very simpatico with that lesson of you can't just let one emotion run the show, they all have wisdom. On the first one, Sadness, Joy learning that Sadness is necessary. It's all about integration, but it was beautiful the way kids understand it and it's a way to teach emotional literacy to your kids. So I think what they've done there with those Inside Out movies is just brilliant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical.

John Mark Nickels (01:11:11):
Yeah, so Eight Sleep is a smart mattress company. They're on their third or fourth rev now, but it's like a Tempur-Pedic mattress, or you can put their cover on any mattress, but it has a cover that has little tubes of water, and then it has a little computer thing and you fill with water and then an app. And basically what you do is you program it and it learns, it has sensors, it can measure your heart rate, your HRV, body temperature, all that, but you're basically trying to program a temperature curve to help you maximize your kind of REM sleep and deep sleep and get more value out of the sleep that you do have.

(01:11:41):
And so for me, it's super cool early for deep sleep, and then it warms you up as you want to wake up, which is... or an alarm and all that. But it's back to my thing about wanting to show up with the right mindset and energy and aliveness. Having really high quality sleep has been a really key part of that, is like if I don't sleep well, I didn't get enough sleep or didn't sleep well, you're already starting off on a bad foot. So yeah, if you haven't checked out Eight Sleep, great product. No endorsement fee for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:12):
What's also cool about it is it tracks your sleep. It gives you all these stats. Instead of wearing a ring, and it gives you all these stats about your sleep quality. And there's this guy, Brian Johnson, I don't know if you follow him, he's like this guy that's trying to stay alive as long as possible, and he had a perfect sleep score for six months in a row to set the record.

John Mark Nickels (01:12:30):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):
Yeah. He knows what he's doing over there. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, think of, find useful in work or in life?

John Mark Nickels (01:12:42):
Yeah, I probably have had different ones over the years. The one right now that really serves me is there's this track called Sit Around the Fire by Jon Hopkins, but it's on Spotify, Apple Music, but it's basically music with one of Ram Dass' talks, lesser known talks. And so the mantra that's been really serving me recently is the very first part of that, which is he says, "Beyond all polarities, I am. Let the judgments and opinions of the mind be the judgments and opinions of the mind. And you exist behind that." So sometimes I have an abbreviated version of that where I'm noticing I'm activated, I'm clinging to an opinion, I'm arguing with somebody, and I'm just like, "Beyond all polarities."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:44):
An abbreviated version.

John Mark Nickels (01:13:45):
I do that in front of my kids and they laugh at me like, "Daddy is so weird sometimes."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):
Beyond all polarities, kids. That's so funny. Oh man. There's another Ram Dass line that I often use with my wife, Be Here Now, which is the title of his book that everyone sees with the blue cover. And I do that when she's on her phone and we're doing something. I'm like, "Be here now." And she's like, "Okay, okay. I'll put my phone away." Yeah. Final question. I was going to ask you about the line tracking and what you learned from that. You already shared an awesome lesson from that time. So let me ask you something else. I'll ask you about Travis. Any crazy, fun, memorable stories of working with Travis Kalanick? However you say his last name, Kalanick, Kalanick?

John Mark Nickels (01:14:27):
Travis Kalanick, yeah. Yeah. I'll share a quick one that's short but sweet or hilarious to me, and maybe lesser known. So we used to have the Uber office at 1455 Market, and so there was one conference room where we'd often do reviews with Travis, and it wasn't the war room, whatever whenever room it was. That was interior and no windows. So this room had windows overlooking, what was that? 11th street. So 11th and Market. And so we'd have a presentation up on the projector, some big screen we're about to go through something with Travis. And reliably, every time he'd come in, he would close the blinds of the windows. Everyone like, "Travis, what are we doing?" It's not because there was glare. They were orthogonal to the screen. And then one time I was like, "Why are you doing that?" He's like, "I'm pretty sure Lyft has drones outside the windows of our office and they're spying on our presentation."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:19):
Oh my gosh.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:23):
I was like, whoa, your competitor paranoia runs deep, man. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:32):
It's hard to mention Lyft doing that. I could see Uber doing that to Lyft.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:36):
Old Uber. Uber 1.0

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Old Uber. Yeah. Wow. That's amazing. It's like coaches in the NFL that are covering their lips always when they're telling and giving plays, just like, I wonder if people actually do that. That's amazing. Yeah, I get that. It's like high stakes. You never know. Might be a drone out there.

John Mark Nickels (01:15:54):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):
Amazing. J.M., what a roller coaster of a conversation. We covered so much ground. I can't even name all the things we covered. So let me just ask you two final questions. Where can folks find you online and reach out if they want to work with you? I know you work with folks, talk about that. And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

John Mark Nickels (01:16:13):
Yeah, yeah. So I am occasionally on Twitter @NickelsJM, but I don't tweet a lot, but maybe I should start. But the best way to find more about my thoughts and thinking on the soft skill stuff is a website called rhythmofbeing.com. And I've got some blog posts and stuff there that go into detail on some of these things. And yeah, I do a little bit of coaching on the side with folks. I do very little now. My day job at Uber and my night job with my kids takes up most of my waking hours. But for the right person and a few select spots, I can make time. But yeah, that's the best place to find me, is rhythmofbeing.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
And then how can listeners be useful to you?

John Mark Nickels (01:16:57):
Well, in the spirit of welcoming and embracing feedback, you could most be useful by reaching out, telling me what resonated, what didn't, what was useful, where did your energy go up when I talked, and where did your energy go down? Because that to me is a signal of where I'm back to tracking the life, where's the juice? And then that way in the future when I do other versions of this or other conversations, I'll pay more attention to the energy up stuff and go more there, and the energy down was like, okay, maybe that wasn't as interesting or didn't resonate. Great. No problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):
J.M., thank you so much for being here.

John Mark Nickels (01:17:38):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):

# How a great founder becomes a great CEO | Jonathan Lowenhar (co-founder of Enjoy The Work)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work. I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:11):
To be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:30):
Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot. It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Something you talk about, there's these two phases to a startup journey and most people focus on the first phase.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:51):
Phase one is build something people want to buy. Phase two, the one we don't talk about is now you have to build a company around that thing people want to buy. Building a company is always the same. I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
You've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box paradigm that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long-term.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:01:11):
This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you, you ping them and you hope you get a deal. Magic Box argues that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. They see the fantasy, they fall in love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan runs a firm called Enjoy The Work, which I've heard amazing things about from so many people over the years. Their firm has a singular mission, to help founders become great CEOs. They do this through a blend of mentoring and advising services, which are rooted in their study of how the best startups operate. They take these lessons and fold them into frameworks and advice and training that they offer their CEOs, their insight, which you'll hear in our conversation, is that most founders don't come into the job knowing how to be a CEO, which includes learning how to do hiring, how to manage financials, figure out growth strategy, road mapping, planning, people management, and so many other skills that nobody teaches a founder.

(00:02:16):
In our conversation, Jonathan shares the most common CEO failure modes that he and his team have seen, the Magic Box paradigm for successfully selling your startup, a bunch of advice for finding and hiring the best talent, a framework for building a repeatable go-to-market motion, why and how you should learn to trust your intuition more as a founder and so much more. We could have gone on for so many more hours. Maybe he'll be back to share more advice. If you're a founder or hope to be a founder one day, this episode is for you.

Welcome to the podcast,

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:03):
Lenny, I am damn excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:05):
So am I. The reason I'm excited to have you in this podcast is that you basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, what causes them pain, what causes them to fail, what causes them to struggle, and then you take that and you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work with founders, and I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain? How do I avoid these things that I'm going to probably run into? To build on that, briefly, can you just help people understand what it is you do, what it is your organization does with founders, how you work with founders?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:38):
Yeah, thank you. I'll tell a bit of origin story that I think ends up answering that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
Let's do it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:45):
I had run a bunch of different types of companies and they were really different ones. I ran a big division for a public company, then I was a private equity CEO, then I did back-to-back startups. The first one didn't get very far, but we sold it, and the second one got really far. When I left the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups, early stage, growth stage, when they were run well, they were all run well the same way?

(00:04:35):
I started to obsess about this question, and what it led me to realize is that every well-run company has a rhythm. It's unmistakable, you can't miss it. You can't not see it. You just spend a couple of days through a spy cam watching a business, you'll see the pattern. How come some startups get there and some don't? How does a founder learn the rhythm? How do they learn how to run a company well? I started to ask investors obsessively, and I asked them, Lenny, I asked them all three questions, same three over and over and over again.

(00:05:14):
First question was, well, describe to me your ideal founder. What's a great founder? The answers universally were the same. Investors would use words that meant grit and tenacity and courage and insight, and I'd say, "Great. Question number two, describe to me a great startup CEO," and they use none of those words. How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going.

Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:07:57):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:08:15):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:37):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever?

Christina Gilbert (00:08:48):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's OneSchema.co. There's obviously this new meme of founder mode. I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode. You basically have to be good at both. This latter part is almost manager mode. Is that a way to think about it?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:34):
Yes. Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
Do share.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:42):
It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. If we think about an ascending startup, there's this phase of I have to invent something. I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.

(00:10:52):
The things required to launch a company are not the same as grow a company as scale a company as exit a company, and the best startup CEOs learn them all along the way. There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
I love that. I'm glad we got there. I wasn't planning to talk about founder mode, but I think this is really helpful for folks to hear that are founders and people working for founders too. Along these same lines, you have a really helpful and really funny also mental model for how to think about common failure modes of founders. You have these labels that I love, and this is actually the first thing I heard about Enjoy The Work is these labels that you guys use, and you also, a similar mental model for failure modes for a startup. Can you just share these modes that you've come up with?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:12:31):
We do take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. As I've shared with you previously, the name of our company is not an accident. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves, so we do fuck around quite a bit. I think if I would separate failure modes for companies versus CEOs for a minute, the company ones are not quite as comedic, but they are ones we see all the time. One is you chose the wrong market. I don't think we need to belabor that one. Lots of your prior guests have talked about the importance of getting that part right or nothing else really matters.

(00:13:05):
Second, back to what we were discussing a minute ago, build something people want to buy, got to go build the right thing. Cool. Third one, founder's function. We like to joke that more companies die from suicide than homicide, and it's grim, but also if the two or three people in charge of the business can't get along, nothing else matters. It's all going to break apart. Then fourth, execution, and execution now leads back to CEO. Okay, so now we have a bunch of playful ones here. We have the robot CEO, who believes emotion should not ever exist at a startup, at which point we train them on a very simple formula. Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
I love how engineering-oriented that advice is, which makes sense for robots. Yeah.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:14:03):
Also, a little bit more graceful of an answer there is also our CEOs want urgency and passion and excitement from their teams. They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have several robots working for us and you just press a button and they do a thing. Second one is a pleaser CEO. This is the person who is far more concerned with being liked than running a business, so they can't tell anyone hard news. They can't break ties, they want a consensus on everything, and that's not possible.

(00:14:56):
If you have a group of thoughtful people working for you, they're going to fight, they're going to debate and you want them to. Then at some point you have to call it and say, "No, we're going left not right." Or, "The two of you need to go get in a room and deal with something." Or, "Hey, the way you just showed up is not the way I want you to show up." The pleaser CEO won't do any of that. They will simply hide and pray It goes away and it won't go away. Next one is a perfectionist CEO. I'd like to say that these are the CEOs with the most beautiful product to be delivered minutes before they file for bankruptcy. This is the person who is far more concerned with being right and believing that there's always a right answer than just moving forward.

(00:15:36):
It creates two problems in a business. One is you're just slow and the other one is you'll never take any bets because you will build a team that realizes the CEO is not allowed to be wrong, so you can't disagree, you can't use intuition, you can't use gut. Everything has to be utterly factual and that is simply not possible. In early-stage startups, you have more questions than you do answers. Everything is circumstantial. It's not like watching CSI entrepreneurship and you get to see a video to say, "Oh, look, the guy did it." No, we have a bunch of little data points you have to come to a conclusion. The next one is the angry CEO.

(00:16:15):
I had a founder of mine a bunch of years ago and we were seeing a pattern across the leadership team and he and I get on the phone one morning and I said, "I have a theory for you. It might be a story, I might be wrong, but I want to share." He said, " Okay." I said, "I think you wake up in the morning angry and you don't know it, and then you get to the office and you beat the crap out of the first employee that crosses paths with you over something utterly unrelated because you're angry. You realize that a few hours later and you apologize and your team hasn't quit yet because they believe you're a good human who doesn't have good self-control." Then I shared with him, "And you just had your first child. My guess is because I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a therapist, that you are modeling something that's happened in your life. Is this something you want to change?"

(00:17:09):
His answer is yes, and I said, "Great. I have good news and bad news. The good news is because you said yes, we can do something about it, and the bad news is I don't know what to fucking do. That's not my job." The point being, no one wants to work for the angry person. I don't care what the equity potential is worth, no one wants to work for that person, and the moment they see greener pastures elsewhere, they're leaving. The next one is the one that drives me particularly crazy, it's the laissez-faire CEO, who insanely believes that I can just hire great people and utterly ignore them and let markets take care of themselves and they will do all the right things. I have never met anyone, Lenny, that didn't benefit from good management and the laissez-faire CEO believes that management is not required, and so what they ultimately find is they have really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved.

(00:17:59):
Every CEO we can reductively reduce to one of two characters. They're either comfortable with the brake or comfortable with the accelerator. The challenge with those who are comfortable with the brake, what I mean by that is they don't want to spend any money, so they're driving this beautiful sports car and they're just leaning on the brake the whole time. Yes, they won't run any money, and yes, they will also get lapped by everyone else and miss the opportunity. Where their opportunity is, is where can you take bets? Where can you actually downshift that car in such a way where you give yourself a chance in the market? Separate, those who ride the accelerator, we've all met this one. They're going to run out of money really fast, and this connects to one of our other challenging CEO types, the ready, fire, aim.

(00:18:49):
Most CEOs are really bad at planning and that's because there's this little-known secret in the Bay area, most CEOs have never run a business before. Planning doesn't have to be some heavy bureaucratic multi-month exercise that begins in August and ends in February, but a little bit of bottoms up planning to say, what are we trying to achieve? How do we quantify it? What resources are required? What humans are going to do what? How do we shorten feedback loops so we know in a week, in a month and two months, whether we're on the right trajectory? The ready, fire, aim CEO says, "I don't want to do any of that because they're improvisational and they just want to take bets and they want to take shots," and that's what got the company started, and that's also what will have the company go bankrupt. The micromanager one is the opposite of laissez-faire. They believe that no matter how many employees they have, they can do the job better.

(00:19:42):
The challenge with this one is it is massively disrespectful to those who work for you. We think that, and this is a bit insulting, that everyone that works for a founder can be fit into one or two chunks. They're either an adult or a child. I have a three-year-old, my little girl is amazing. I'm utterly in love. If she doesn't have a lot of structure and a lot of supervision, she's going to run into things, man. Into things, off things, through things, but adults don't need to be given utter instruction and watched all the time. In fact, it needs to be the opposite. We agree on what success is, what resources are, and you let them go and they'll come back to you when they have questions. The micromanager CEO doesn't see the difference between those two humans. They don't trust anybody and that's actually the thing under the thing under the thing, so they want to do everyone's work and that will succeed right up into the point everyone quits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):
This is amazing. Okay, so let me recap these labels that you have just for folks. I have them written down here. There's the robot CEO, perfectionist CEO, pleaser CEO, micromanager, laissez-faire, ready, fire, aim, riding the brake and then riding the gas, and as you said, the ever-popular angry CEO.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:03):
You got them all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
As people hear this, I imagine people self-identify a few of these, like I have some of this, I have some of that, and it's not like black or white. No one is like, "I'm a 100% robot CEO, and I need to fix that." It's like a pie chart kind of, I don't know, what's a visual of this? Everyone's got a little bit of this, basically.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:24):
That's right. I enjoy giving this talk on stage and watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments, but it doesn't mean that they're all one or the other. If they were all one of these and then didn't want to even accept the possibility that there's a little bit of a lot of these that they could work on, they're probably not coachable and they're not going to be in the talk anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:45):
It's like I imagine each of these is very particular and it's this journey you go on to work on yourself. Let me just ask, what's the most common issue that you've found across these labels of type CEOs? What's the most common one and what do you often recommend someone to work on specifically to help them through that?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:22:02):
I think ready, fire, aim is the most common that we've seen, and that has been an affliction that's been growing in the last number of years. It wasn't long ago that CEOs could paper over poor execution with easy access to capital. Suddenly, over the last number of years, we're expecting founders to be better operators. Better operators means eventually being on a path when more cash comes into the business and out of the business. That doesn't happen by accident. The ready, fire, aim CEO has probably suffered this pain where they took lots and lots of bets. Maybe they measured the outcome after the fact and they were wrong and they were wrong and they were wrong in ways that were expensive, and they've raised their hand to say, "I see it. I want to get better at this." Basic, basic business design and business planning is not some corporate effort. It's some thoughtful exercise that starts with what are we working backwards from?

(00:23:02):
Because in any given time, Lenny, companies are working backwards from one of four things, whether they like it or not. I am working backwards from an exit. I'm working backwards from a next fundraise. I'm working backwards from profitability or I'm working backwards from winding down. We don't talk about the fourth one that much, but I got to choose one. I got to choose the top of the mountain. More often than not, they're choosing a fundraise. Then we'll ask that founder, you know your market, you know your investors, you know the next set of investors, we've done some intel. What has to be true to unlock the next fundraise? That's a qualitative and quantitative answer, but we write it down. We need to get better at go to market. We need to land our first partner. We need to launch next iteration of the product and show this level of efficacy, engagement, what have you. Can we codify that? Yes. Can we talk through what actions would be required on what cadence to unlock that quantified set of results? Yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:24:00):
... that quantified set of results? Yes. Do we understand what resources would be required to do those things? Recognize we might have to squint through some of it, but again, the answer is yes. [inaudible 00:24:13] now aimed. If we have a culture that has some accountability, that has a communication architecture, so there's some rituals about how we meet and how we share information and how we talk through problems, and how we work through bottlenecks, well, now we have a plan and now we have accountability. I now no longer have to just guess all the time. And this only works for the CEO who says, "My improvisational efforts got me here, but I don't think they'll get me there."

(00:24:47):
There's a guy I worked for a long time ago, and he had this phrase... He had like seven or eight phrases, he would use them over and over and over again. It was hard not to commit them all to memory, and one of them was, "If you keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting." And for the ready, fire, aim folks who realize the weakness of that at scale, the way to counteract that, is to start with good planning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):
It's interesting that's the most common type of CO, when with Founder Mode, it feels like it just accelerates that further. The whole meme of Founder Mode, which are what makes you upset. Makes sense. Great.

(00:25:26):
Okay, so I love that you talked about exiting as basically one of these four working backwards paths, because that's where I wanted to go next. I want to talk about some of these specific frameworks and skills and methodologies that you teach, and one of them... I want to almost go to the end of selling your company. And the reason I'm excited to talk about this, is if you think about, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like most startups that succeed end up selling their company. That's the most likely success, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:25:58):
Yes, by far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
Great. Yeah, because the other option is IPO or just run this privately forever. Or fail, basically, and fold. So of the successful options, the most common is selling. At the same time, founders have never done this before, they don't know what they're doing. The other side, often, has done it many times, and so it's a pretty treacherous and scary and high-stakes thing to do and to learn on the spot. And you've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box Paradigm that I love, that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long term. Can you talk about what this is?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:26:36):
I can, and I want to give credit where it's due. There's a book by this name, it's called Magic Box Paradigm, written by an independent banker named Ezra Roizen. And the book's fantastic, and Ezra is fantastic.

(00:26:46):
What we've done, is we've operationalized it so that we could teach founders over, and over, and over again. If the founder wants to hire a banker for this particular process, because we're not bankers, we're not BD, we don't get paid that way, we're teachers. But if wanted to hire a banker, go hire Ezra. But the methodology itself is a inversion for how venture and venture boards have thought about startups being ready for sale for a long, long time. It's utterly counter to so much advice that founders have heard. There are two ways you can get acquired. This is purposely reductive. One is you put up a for-sale sign. This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you. You figure out the categories of buyers, the companies there, the contact list within that. You ping them and say, "We're open to a transaction," or some euphemism the like. You contact them and say, "I'll give you some information now. Sign an NDA. Give me an indication of interest by this date." And you work through a process, and you pray you have more than one person at the end of the game, try and ratchet them up, sign a term sheet. They will then re-trade along the way, right up until the point you die and you hope you get a deal done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
Sounds very familiar.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:28:08):
And it's one that often will just hit the nervous system of any founder that's been through it a couple of times. Because man, is it a fraught exercise? What Magic Box argues, is that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.

(00:28:43):
All right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage startup, and you meet a company that is in your space, in your vertical, what have you, and they're much more advanced than you. It's a large business. Generally speaking, another oversimplification here, large companies are interested in small companies because they're technology. And small companies are interested in large companies because they're distribution. And there's someone at the large company who becomes fascinated with you.

(00:29:12):
What's the fascination? What they see in their head is, "Oh, interesting. If I buy your company, this thing happens." The classic example of this is Instagram. This is the number one example of this. Lenny, do you remember how much revenue they had when they got acquired by now Meta?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
I think it was zero.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:34):
I think it was zero.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:35):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:36):
Do you remember the acquisition price?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):
A billion dollars, which was absurd at that point.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:41):
There was no math Facebook could use, historically speaking, that would justify a billion dollars. It had to be a model on the future. This is Magic Box to a T. They had a fantasy that adding Instagram would expand ad revenue. They figured out some way to prove it. I'll explain more on what I mean by proof. And then their quantification was based on the future. And that's the difference between a Magic Box approach and traditional approaches. Traditional approaches are based on the past, Magic Box is on the future.

(00:30:14):
Let me tell a story. In one of our companies in construction tech, their technology was able to suck in video camera data from construction sites for project planning. No one was doing this yet. And the business was doing pretty well. We helped the founders launch the company. We got first product in market. We raised a couple of rounds of capital. The product mostly worked. But we weren't sure it was venture scale as we were going along. And we had some large construction tech companies and real estate companies and development companies leaning into us. And one particular company then said, "Huh, we're really good at construction planning, and we've collected all of this video data that we don't use at all." And the champion on the other side in the product org, he has a fantasy. "Oh, shit. We take your video analytics platform and plug it into what we do, and this is what happens to my business."

(00:31:18):
Now, the person on the other side is a person. And the reason I'm being specific about that, is because you don't sell to a company. Magic Box is about finding the person. You're finding the champion on the other side, the person who has motivated for their own reasons, career, money, reputation, what have you. They see the fantasy. They fall in love. And this person says, "I am in love with this idea. If I can grab security data into my product organization. Now I have to prove the fantasy."

(00:31:53):
What's different about a champion in this kind of process, is they want to find a way to say yes. They're not looking for a way to say no. And this brings us to the four characters you're going to meet along the path of Magic Box. There might be a fifth. You're going to meet your champion, you're going to meet your advocates, you're going to meet your blockers, and you're going to meet your buyer. You might meet Corp Dev along the way.

(00:32:20):
Let me talk about each of those folks. The champion is the one who's fallen in love. They're the ones with the fantasy. They're the ones who are arguing on your behalf. They're the ones fighting for you when you're not in the room. They are texting you, they're telling you things about the business that they're probably not supposed to tell you.

(00:32:33):
The buyer. All they care about is math. It might be a committee, it might be a group, the IC, the EC, the investment group, what have you. They're the ones who actually can sign off on a deal. They care about business case.

(00:32:45):
Advocates... Lenny, do you play chess?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:49):
I have played chess, yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:32:50):
You have played chess. So advocates are pawns. They don't matter at all until they matter enormously. These are folks that, like, you are the CEO doing a meeting with your potential buyer, and there are somehow 12 people on the Zoom call, but only two do the talking. The other 10 might be advocates. They're rooting for you, but they will take no political risk. Their value is in giving you intel.

(00:33:16):
Blocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your champion just wants you to get the deal done so in love. So what happens, is they've come up with a fantasy and you as a CEO need to lean into it. This isn't enterprise selling. I'm not trying to sell you this thing that I have. I'm just trying to find ways to say yes.

(00:33:47):
So when, in my story, the person says, "Could we provide you all of our video data that we've collected forever and you now could enhance our ability to predict whether large- scale construction projects are on time"? I don't want the CEO saying anything other than, "We can do that."

(00:34:07):
Now, phase two, I need to prove it. Okay, because I have a champion who wants to say yes, proof can be really easy. And the reason the proof is so important, is not to convince the champion they're in love with the fantasy. They're already convinced. It's because in almost all cases, big company is buying little company and your champion doesn't have unilateral authority. They're going to socialize the deal. They have to get buy-in from who? The aforementioned buyer. They have to be able to survive the aforementioned blockers.

(00:34:43):
So eventually, when they pitch this to whatever committee is in charge, that committee is going to say, "What proof do we have that it works?" And we just want to be able to provide the champion with enough evidence that it works. So in this case, we said to the champion, " Well, give us video data, and we will provide you the evidence that you need." Because we're dealing with a champion who's not a cynic, because champions aren't, we could tell them, "And provide us the data in this way, in this fashion, and here's what we'll send you after. Are we in agreement?" We know we're already going to win the proof, and it's critically important in these dances.

(00:35:27):
Number three, quantify. At this point, we're not up for sale, but we're spending a lot of calories on somebody, and they know it. So we have our CEOs say the following phrase to them: "My board is asking questions. They're wondering why we're spending so many calories on this when it's not really core and we're not selling you our product. I'm convinced of how exciting this could be, together, but I think we need to do some math. So I can explain to my board why this might matter. So let's imagine all this works, because it's going to work, and it's a year from now or five years from now. What changes about your business?" And the champion will tell you, "Retention does this, or deal size goes like this, or market share goes like this." And you'll say to them, "Fantastic. Look, I'm going to build some shitty verse version of the model. You tell me what I got right and what I got wrong, but I have a board meeting in 16 days, and I need to be able to walk them through the justify why I am spending so many calories on this exercise."

(00:36:34):
You build the model, you hand it to them. If they in any way respond to your model, you've won. Because you have now divorced history from future, and you are now playing in future, you are playing the Instagram game in this case. The ending of the story for the company that I was describing, it was a business sub 2 million in revenue. Our prospects of raising series B felt low. We were not yet profitable, and that was an exit that was generational wealth for the co-founders and their families. The CEO went on and spent two-plus years with the now public company that did this acquisition. The technology did get integrated, but it took a long time and they had to do a lot of changes to it, certainly beyond what was envisioned during the diligence process. But all parties are happy. And if we hadn't done it this way and we had just been up for sale, we'd get a dollar for that company.

(00:37:40):
A couple of other side points that are really important here. For any of you founders out there that are thinking about working backwards from an exit, there are two things that I really want to stress. One is the fantasy is beyond just, "What is the business change you can have?" The fantasy is, "Your books are in order." Your fantasy is all of your investors will sign off on the deal and you will have unanimous consent, that the key members of your team are going to stick around, that you're a joy to work with. Please God, founder, do not puncture the fantasy at any time.

(00:38:21):
So whatever is starting to shape in your buyer's mind, get to know it. Live that everybody wins from that game. Second, Corp Dev, they will probably show up in the stands. Corp Dev make deals. They're not deal sponsors, they're not a champion, they're not a buyer. They are an expert negotiator. Their job is to facilitate deals and get deals done. The most important things to understand is that they can be a leverage point to have a deal move with some process and some pace and some urgency. Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.

(00:39:04):
Second, they are way better at negotiating than you. So anytime dealing with a superior negotiator, the only thing you can do to try and even the scales, is move the negotiation async. So founders, repeat after me, I'm talking to you directly now. You'll say to Corp Dev, "You know I'm not alone in this decision. I love what you just said and I'm excited about this opportunity. Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with advisors, lawyers, co-founders, whoever." But don't negotiate live. You will lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
Let me just say that was extremely delightful to listen to. I've never heard like a M&A strategy be this fun. And it makes me want to sell a company. It's like, "Okay, let's do this. I'm hyped." I think you got it all. I have a few questions.

(00:39:56):
Interestingly, the middle part is... It feels a lot like enterprise sales, which a lot of founders are used to. Understand the stakeholders move things forward. Here's your champion, here's your blockers, here's the buyer. Is there anything there you want to say, what's maybe most different from enterprise sales, which I think a lot of founders are maybe used to? Or is it pretty similar?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:40:14):
Yeah, I think three things. One is there are a lot of moments in enterprise sales where we're trying to push for a compelling event. That doesn't work in seduction. The playful metaphor that we'll often use, is you've been dating for a while, this person could be the person, but they're not quite convinced yet that it should be a life together, and you're sitting at dinner. And in enterprise sales, you're eager to get it done. You're eager to move the relationship forward and move in and get engaged, what have you. And so you might be inclined to say, "Hey, either we move this relationship the next step, or there are a whole bunch of people eyeing me, and I'm going to go date someone else."

(00:41:06):
That conversation never goes well, and in Magic Box founders are eager to do the same thing, thinking that competition will improve their deal size, when in fact I think more often than not, that is a negative signal until the very end of the dance. So instead in enterprise selling where I'm pushing, in Magic Box, I'm always trying to entice, I'm never, ever trying to push. So instead I might say things like, "Hey, I'm going to raise my next round in Q1, because I've been intending to do this business independently. Now all I really want to do, is win. I just want my product in as many customers' hands as possible. Whether I do that on my own as I was planning, in partnership with someone, or under someone else's roof, honestly I don't care. But I have a company to run and I'm going to go raise my next round in Q1. And if I do that, probably too expensive for this deal to make sense anymore, and my board will want me to move on anyway." I'm enticing. I'm never trying to push.

(00:43:08):
Okay, so I'm thinking about as a founder hearing this, and I feel like what they're probably wondering is that first step of finding that person, starting to build this fantasy. Any advice you could share for a founder that's like, "We probably need to sell this company"? What can they do to start creating these relationships, find this person, create this fantasy in their minds?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:43:28):
Ezra does this really well in the book. Again, it has to be not solicitous. So one of our companies, we had maybe 20 months of capital left, and the two co-founders and our team were convinced, "This isn't a venture business. We thought it might be a venture business. It's not a venture business. It takes too long to do a deal that's not that interesting with each of our enterprise customers." It was disappointing, but at least we were honest about it. "Okay, so who are we going to sell to? Let's go play this game."

(00:44:04):
So we started with categories, categories of buyers. It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer. There were a few different categories. And we said, "Great. Who are the companies within those categories that make sense?" They're acquisitive, they have the balance sheet for it. There's a Corp Dev department, so we know that they actually know what they're talking about here. Ideally, there's an existing relationship with core team or advisors or board members. Make a list.

(00:44:45):
Now, how do we meet them in a way without selling them? So one of the examples in the book, which I love, is small startup wants to meet the luminaries in a space, and they have their PR agency set up a panel where they contact the CEOs of the potential buyers and say, "We're putting together a panel of the world's foremost experts in X. We're going to put four people on the panel, and it's going to be you and famous person number two and famous person number three, and this fourth person," that is a luminary to us. And it's our startup CEO. And suddenly you're at the table as a peer. It's a completely different conversation.

(00:45:32):
The second one, and this is going to sound a little silly, but I am not exaggerating, it works. If you are a CEO founder and you have that title on LinkedIn, it's amazing the responses you'll get. So we made this list and we just started to send connection requests to the CEOs or CPOs or CFOs on our target list, and said something as simple as this, "You're doing something really cool. So are we. You game just for a 30-minute chat? Because I don't know where it'll go, but I think it'll be fun." Keep it that informal. It's peer to peer. I'm not selling you anything.

(00:46:10):
If you can draw a line to some post that they had or some speech that they gave, even better. But we found without fail, there would be math that would show up, one out of four, one out of five, or one out of six, "Yeah, that sounds fun." There's a lot of those CEOs never talk to startups, and that's fascinating to them, especially when presented with the energy of, "I just want to have a fun, intellectual discussion."

(00:46:37):
What you're looking for in that first conversation, and this is what we ask our CEOs to do, is to ask questions like, "What do you care most about in the next year? What's the mandate? What about for your department? What are the things that keep you up at night? What's the break? What's the thing that could actually kill everything, if you had a pre-mortem for the next year?" Those kind of open-ended questions, because what we want our CEO listening for, is the fantasy to see if there's some intersection between what they care about and what we might be able to squint and say we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):
It's interesting, because it sounds a lot like there's a jobs-to-be-done framework here, or just like, "What is the job they need done?" What is the pain you're going to solve, and then create a fantasy around how amazing it'll be for them if you can solve that problem.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:47:19):
And ideally they'll say it and you just reflect it back in active listening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):
Chris Voss negotiation style. Okay, so you're the kind of guest, Jonathan, where the whole podcast could be about each one of these topics, and so I know there's so much more to talk about here. I want to move to a different topic, but to leave folks with, one is if they want to explore this methodology more, there's a book you mentioned, called Magic Box Paradigm by Ezra Roizen, right?

(00:47:51):
If companies are in this process, starting to think about it, does it make sense for them to come to you and like, "Hey, help me through this process"? I know you said, "Go to an investment banker." Or does it make sense to like, "Hey, let's bring on Jonathan," or someone from your team to help them?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
It makes sense to like, Hey, let's bring on Jonathan or someone from your team to help them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:48:03):
We meet two types of founders. Founder one says, fix this part of my business, totally transactional. I want to raise the next round, or I'm hiring people badly or my founders aren't getting along, or I want to sell my company. Well, I need to be honest, that's not interesting to us. That's not our work. Go find someone who is, and I don't mean this disparagingly, but like a screwdriver, like fixes one thing, go fix one thing. Then we meet second type of founder and that founder says, most likely to themselves, 'cause it's the only safe audience. There's some gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be. There are a set of skills that I'm great at and there are these things where I know if I'm really honest with myself, if I listen to the quiet voice, I'm soft at these things or I'm not good enough at these things or I have some imposter syndrome about these things and if I don't get better at them, danger. That's the one we work with. And it's when they care that much about both the hard skill development and maybe the soft skill development in their path to become a great CEO.

(00:49:10):
How to sell the company. It's one of the skills. We teach this to all of our founders as well as hiring and management and planning. I don't care what the thing is. For every one of our founders, we audit them and say, here's what you're great at, here's what you're shitty at, and here's what you've never done before, and which of these do you want to work on next given where the company is in its cycle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):
Great segue to where I wanted to go with this, which is hiring. So I hear all the time that a founder's core job is fundraising and hiring an amazing team. Basically that's their main goal. Just like hire amazing people. The people you hire make your company, create the culture. You got to get that right. But similar to trying to sell your company, most founders have never really hired lots of people, they've never hired for all these different skill sets they're trying to hire for and I know that you guys spend a lot of time helping founders hire and find amazing people. Can you just share some of the advice you share with founders for how to find and hire amazing people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:06):
Yeah, so we actually think the CEO has three jobs. We agree with the two that you said, but we think there's a third. One is, make sure everyone knows where we're going. The second one, pick the right people for the team. Third one, give those people the tools they need to win. And you can abstract from those what they all mean, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:28):
... most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases. The lazy ones, back to laissez-faire, think it's just gambling like, oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them, just gambling. There was work done by and then codified in a beautiful book. I'm going to make sure I get the names right, Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street. They had a consulting firm that dates back to the mid-nineties. Then they wrote a book in 2007 or 2008 called Who: The A Method for Hiring. We have operationalized that book and then expanded on it 'cause there are some parts of it that we found a little dated, but it's really still as applicable today as it ever was.

(00:51:18):
And I think there are three core mistakes that founders make all the time, that can be really easily rectified. The first one is, you should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next. And I know that sounds simple, but founders don't think of hiring that way. They start with a job description. We've been taught that for a long time. Start with the job description. It's a fucking mistake. Start with, it's 12 months later, you hired the person, they started today, 12 months have gone by, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What's changed about the business? What does success look like 12 months later? Document it. And then when you interview people, look for people that have already done that stuff.

(00:52:13):
Second, the notion of does the person in front of you have a history of creating raving fans? They talk in the book about this idea of you being pulled or pushed in your career. If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great. And if you see a history of that, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, really attractive candidate. Third, core values matter a lot. Culture is not an accident. Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent. But that also means you need a methodology for evaluating the next human in front of you on whether they actually represent your values. We think of these interview stages in a way similar to the book, we use slightly different language, but we think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
Funny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was formed around studying what the founders Brian, and Joe, and Nate valued specifically and then they codified them to core values at the business and then there's this team that was a very select handpicked team that at every interview loop interviewed the person for their values.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:54:22):
That is a beautiful example of how interviewing for values is independent of title. 'Cause you'll find people in the company at every stage of a company that are the best ambassadors, the best embodiments of those values. Please use them for interviewing and in addition, they love it 'cause they're protecting their castle. They love where they work, they want to keep it that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):
So true that team is a real special team and it was really honored to be on that team. So let me summarize what you just shared, which I love. There's so much value here, it just keeps going and going. So when you're hiring, your advice is: look for people, one, that have done it before; two, that have been pulled from job to job by someone else that loves their work and wants them to be with them at this new company. And then three, their values match the values of the founder and the business essentially, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:11):
Yes. And for the recruiters out there, a really simple way to get rid of a lot of the crap that ends up showing up at the top of the funnel is just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):
So a couple of follow-up questions here. One is, this point of hiring people that have done it, obviously this implies don't hire junior up-and-comers as much. Thoughts on just when it makes sense to hire someone more junior that's really ambitious, real smart, you think they can learn the job, thoughts there?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:53):
So one of our companies is hiring a team of reasonably junior account execs. We're looking for folks that have been out of school for two years. Now, that means they are highly unlikely to have had three years of quota achievements and a similar... you get the point. Okay, so how do you hire someone who's already done it? We know what success looks like 12 months later. For that role, they've learned how to hunt, they've been able to create pipeline of X and close Y in business, et cetera. What we are looking for then in their history, if they have any sales chops of any kind. They could be selling Girl Scout cookies, or tickets to some event, or they work for a non-profit for while. I don't care, but I want some evidence that they've sold. I want some evidence that they're comfortable getting on the phone or showing up at meetings or showing up at events. So, that they've done it before should be reviewed or thought of creatively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
Got it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:57:07):
Now for more senior roles, I want an explicit. We think of, for example, for executives, Lenny, we think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler. The architect, let's use sales as an example. This is someone who has to build a playbook. So they're going to uncomfortably stay close to the founder, watch and listen, and listen to recordings and pick their brain to pull the magic from the founder of like, oh, here's the dance that she or he goes through to actually close a deal and they write first playbook. And the goal of the codification of that is so you can bring on a first account exec and the next account exec because account execs back to our language earlier in this adult children dynamic are children. You need to give them structure for them to win. That's the architect. The optimizer, this is someone who's now going from a few account execs to maybe 10, 15 and we now have targets we have to hit. The business is now reaching a different level of professionalism and expectation and you have to optimize that earlier playbook to try and find more efficiency and performance out of it.

(00:58:21):
The scaler is saying, okay, now how do I find leverage? How do I have 10X more account execs or how to get other people to sell for me? They're all going to be called VP of sales or chief revenue officer. They're completely different archetypes, and that same person exists in engineering and in product, et cetera. In those cases, I only would want to bring on an architect if they'd been an architect before. If they'd only been an optimizer, they're going to fail because they've never written playbook from scratch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
It touches on a conversation I had recently. It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the wrong one of those buckets, essentially. Like you enjoy certain type of work and your job is not doing that type of work, whether it's in your case scaling or optimizing. And so, it just reminds that if you're frustrated at work, you're in the wrong job in terms of the type of output they're trying to expect from you.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:59:18):
The story in my head is that talking to me and my colleagues sometimes can feel a little like death by frameworks. We have one for everything and in this example, I think if you're going to be sustainably successful in any kind of job, I don't care what it is, three things have to be true. You have to be good at it, you have to like it, and the market has to give a shit about it. And if one of those is off, you're not staying in that job long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
Yeah. And this touches on the name of your firm, Enjoy The Work, got to enjoy the work to make it sustainable. Okay, one other thing. So one other follow up question real quick on the hiring and then I want to talk about one other bucket of work. And again, I think each of these could be like an hour, two hour long podcast conversation. I love that there's this recurring theme of working backwards to inform what you do today. So earlier you talked about working backwards from what the outcome you want next for your business, whether it's fundraising or exit or winding down. And for hiring, you have the similar advice, work backwards from what you want this person to achieve in the first year, whether it's drive this sort of growth in the product or drive sales. I guess anything else there of just the power of working backwards versus the typical approach for hiring, you talked about job descriptions.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:00:26):
Hiring is never the goal and it's often the first thing that we'll hear from a founder, "I have to hire this person." One, that is so dangerous for confirmation bias. The hiring manager is always the one most burdened by that particular bias, but it's also hiring is never the goal. We will pull them back to over and over and over again, which of the three milestones matter, right? Fundraise, exit, profitability. What has to change about the business, for example, to get to that fundraise? How do we quantify that change? Some sort of goal setting framework. OKRs, EOs, I don't care. All goal setting frameworks have the same bones. There's some description of it, there's some quantification of it, there's some work that has to be done. There's some accountability rituals with clear owners and clear agreements.

(01:01:18):
So once I actually have the quantification of here's what work needs to be done, I now know what resources I need to be able to pull that work forward and therefore now I know what kind of humans I need, whether I'm hiring or renting. And that should drive the conversation, not the, "Oh God, I need another PM." It's no, here's the set of features that we've said matter most this year. Here's the gap in the resources we have and the resources we need, that's why we're hiring this role. And here's what success would look like 12 months from now or six months from now. So they're tying back to what would change about the business.

(01:01:57):
And this is this recurring theme of our work with our founders. They're so in it Lenny that they rarely have time to sit above what they're working on. This notion of working in the business versus on the business. And so much of our work is to separate them from the day-to-day, which is enormously important, not in any way denigrating it, and I need to know where I'm headed and why, and how I'm going to measure progress along the way. And so, so much of what we're doing with them is to say, I want to hear from you what you think success looks like. I'm going to push back and pressure test a bunch of things. Can we define that in a way? Can we agree on who needs to do the work along the way, and how we're going to keep checking on it to keep feedback loop short? Now we can go back into business and then we'll check again in a week or in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):
I love that. That's actually a great segue to the final bucket I want to spend some time on which is growth and go to market. Another area that many founders have never worked on before. A lot of founders are like, Hey, I have this awesome idea. I'm going to build this awesome product. I know how to do that. I know what market needs. But building a go-to-market motion to get it into people's hands is a whole different skill. We spent a lot of time on this on the podcast, you have a really cool simple framework of just how to think about go-to-market. There's all this like, oh, you need a go-to-market strategy. Talk about how you talk to founders about thinking about what it takes to put together a go-to-market plan and how to make it a repeatable motion versus just I'm just going to go to people and try to sell them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:03:37):
Our founders, even the most capable of them find this topic pretty overwhelming because it branches into so many areas. So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks. We think of it in four pieces. The first piece is ideal customer profile. Who do we really want to sell to? What are their qualifications? What are the discovery questions we would use to get to those qualifications? What are the kill criteria to know that this is [inaudible 01:04:10] fool's goal, this really isn't the human?

(01:04:13):
Second bucket, loosely called marketing. But within that marketing is also positioning. So what is our uncommon denominator from the enemies? So who are we competing against? Is it actual companies or is it status quo in some sort? What are they great at? What are we great at? What are we great at that they're not? Then how do we represent that in the world? That's branding and artifacts and identity work, et cetera.

(01:04:44):
Next is demand gen, which we'll simplify to say, how do we go find the humans we want? I've long loved the book Traction that Gabriel Weinberg... I'm going to forget unfortunately the co-author's name right now, Jason Mares? Sorry. Where they talk about the 19 channels that all companies have availability to, they're the same ones. Now the book has got a couple of years on it, so there are a couple of new channels that have popped out since, but what we then try and expand the aperture for our founders is rather than just think about meeting your next customer through however you did at your last company, availability bias, instead, which of these might make most sense next? A simple two by two matrix can work here like some experimentation, some brain writing. Love brain writing, not brainstorming. I know you've talked about that on prior pods. And then high impact, low effort. Can we think of the three or four experiments we want to run by channel? Let's go play.

(01:05:48):
And then fourth, sales. And this is the codification of a playbook. How are we having the conversation? How are we doing discovery? How are we handling objections? How are we doing demo? How are we moving to close? If we can get through those four, then we can start to talk about deployment and customer success and upselling and account management, et cetera, et cetera. Those are good problems to have. Oh my god, my install base is so large, I need to manage it. Great, great fricking problem. But we try and break this complexity of going from individually selling to building a machine into just these four buckets. Who am I selling to? What do we want to say about ourselves? How do we reach them? How do we close them?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):
Amazing. I was going to summarize that. You did an excellent job there. Before we follow up on this, you mentioned this term brain writing. What does that mean?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:35):
Oh, first time I heard of this was Adam Grant. I don't know if he's the originator of the idea. Brainstorming, you talked about this a bit in your Annie Duke podcast as well of how horribly coercive meetings can be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):
For brainstorming, especially.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:56):
For brainstorming especially. And so, what many of our founders don't recognize because they just see like, Hey, I'm just sitting around a table with a group of folks I respect, so we can just debate things as peers. No, you can't. You're a founder. Your voice has a megaphone attached to it even if you can't hear it. So you have to turn down the megaphone if you actually want to learn what your people have to say. So brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... it could be in a survey, it could be in a shared doc, what have you, my preferences in through some sort of methodology, you are now sharing your opinions, comments, edits, dreams, in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified.

(01:07:50):
Then when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass. Let everyone read the thing. I even like the Amazon, take the first 10 minutes of a meeting, let's just go read so we're all fully present and then have a debate. What it allows for is the dampening of the founder effect in meetings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
You're just so full of golden nuggets. That's just like a random tangent that I think could be really transformative for a lot of teams. So the advice here is just when you're trying to ideate and brainstorm, don't go in a big room and put post- its on a wall and talk throughout ideas and have a discussion. Instead, just everyone individually sits and thinks and shares their thoughts and the founder presents, here's a problem, here's a question we're trying to tackle.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:08:39):
What it also allows for is an evening of the playing field between fast processors and slow processors, introverts and extroverts, because they're all equally potentially talented in your room, but if you do live brainstorming, you have diminished all the folks that prefer to sit and chew on something first.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:02):
That's very much me. That's exactly how I operate. I need to think and process. I'm not on the spot quick thinker person. So 100% fan of this approach. Let me come back to your go-to-market framework. I have the notes pulled up here. So basically if you're a founder or even a product builder and you're trying to think about how do I... people keep telling me I need a go to market plan, I need to grow this thing. How do I think about this? You're basically saying there's these four buckets to think about; who are you selling to? How are you going to motivate them and get them excited to buy your thing? How do you reach them? And then how do you close them?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:09:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):
Luckily I have podcasts and newsletter posts on every single one of these buckets, if folks want to pursue each one of these. I have templates for ICPs, marketing advice, all these things. So that's good news. There's a lot of content for people to read if they want to explore this stuff. Let me ask you, where do you often find the biggest bang for your buck when you come to a founder or if founder comes to you and they're like, I need to figure out, go-to-market motions? Just start from the top and work your way down. Or is there, here's where maybe you want to spend a lot of time.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:10:10):
Early stage founders, and this is certainly more true for the first timers Lenny than the veterans 'cause they learn this problem. The first timers are like twenty-something year olds in a bar and they're being social for the first time in their lives, and anyone that makes eye contact with them is enough for them to say, I want to go on a date with you. That's it. There's no discrimination of any kind, like, oh my god, they like me, I'm in. That's the mistake that hounds first timers. The veterans and those we get our hands on. Instead, we say, let's imagine you could build your perfect customer in a lab, like a Petri dish and you grew them, what do they look like? And if you have any kind of install base, I'll ask the question. I just did this with the founder the other day. They are enterprise whale hunting business. They have four large customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:13):
Wait, actually whale... okay, whale hunting in terms of large wealth person or actual whales?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:21):
The extreme of enterprise selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Okay, okay, got it. I want to see a whale hunting startup. Okay, go on.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:29):
I said, so which of your four customers is your favorite? Which one, if I got them on the phone, they would rave about you. They would be salivating openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them. And they was like, oh, that's clear. It's this one of the four. Great. Tell me about them. And what you start to see and pull apart from that is the founder does have an ideal profile. They do have a dream. Now, there are all sorts of risks about is the world too small? Is it not a big enough market if they get too tight, and founders get so caught up in that and it's a mistake because all we're-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:12:00):
... so caught up in that, and it's a mistake. Because all we're looking for in the beginning is a white-hot center of opportunity, a small population that is an enormous fan that's getting enormous impact. We can worry about adjacencies and expansion later. I like to remind them that Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it. So where the founders often get hung up on for us is that they've moved towards selling without contemplating ideal customer profile, without contemplating qualifications, without contemplating discovery questions that get to that. And most importantly, kill criteria, if this is true do not sign them, even if they want to go out on a date with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
I'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I believe and I hear often on this podcast is how underappreciated picking your customers in early leads are. And if you think about this funnel you described, figure out who you're selling to, how do you motivate them, find them and then sell them, all this trickles down from who are you going after. You will know how to motivate them if you know who you're talking to versus the opposite. If you're talking to everyone-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:11):
It's the most expensive mistake of those four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:15):
Okay. Is there anything else on go-to-market or growth you think might be helpful just to touch on before we close up our conversation?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:25):
The one thing I'll share, this goes back to the ready, fire, aim that we talked about earlier, is that there's implicitly a funnel, mathematical funnel, to what we just described. And founders often make the mistake when planning for the year ahead of I need to be at this revenue to justify this multiple. And then all of the funnel math is a plug, and that's death, as opposed to here's what's been true for the last three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. And then what assumptions can I reasonably make with ways I'm going to influence that funnel going forward, to go build up to where I think I'll be a year from now? And it just lowers the bias that your planning process operates with.

(01:14:15):
But when a founder starts from a place of, "I have to get to 3 million or we're dead," you're already dead. As opposed to what do I really believe I can do to get there, changing top of the funnel, changing conversion rates along the way, changing a deal size or deal length, et cetera based on my recent history, and then have a conversation about the gap between where I think the business reasonably can get with some ambition, and where I think I need to be financially, because that's the more mature conversation and that's the one the ready, fire, aim CEO doesn't have. That's the one most founders have only started to learn to have over the last few years when capital dried up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
I love that. I love just how practical and real talk your advice always ends up being. Speaking of that, I emailed a founder that you work with and asked him, "What should I ask? What should I ask Jonathan when he comes on the podcast?"

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:14:57):
Uh-oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):
And he said something that was really... That's great. It was really unexpected what he said. He said that the biggest lesson he learned from you is to, as a founder, to trust his intuition more throughout the journey of his startup. Can you just talk about that as something you've learned, something you've seen, that maybe founders under appreciate?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:15:31):
It's impossible not to be a startup CEO and not face many existential moments. Is my company going to survive? Did I make a mistake? Will I ever be hired again? Should I sell the company now? Should I break up with a co-founder? Should I fire this critical employee? They happen to all of us. And fear is not a good decision maker. Our lizard brain is a really bad decision maker in those moments.

(01:16:07):
And so what we'll often share with the founder who's facing one of these scenarios, and I know the CEO you're describing and he's facing one of these scenarios, we'll say to them, "Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one." And most of the time, Lenny, when I frame it that way the person across me says, "Yeah, I know that voice." And I'll ask, "How do you hear it?" And they're usually some version of, "I have to get really alone, really still, really quiet, walk on the beach, listen to music, work out, play with my pet."

(01:17:06):
I said that voice is who you are. It's not your brain. Your brain is a tool. It's our hands, it's our feet, just a tool. It's a pattern recognition machine. But who you are, if you can watch your brain, you know what you're thinking, like, oh, look what my brain's doing. That means you're not your brain. It's something else. And that's the little voice, and that little voice is going to be right. And where we get screwed up in life is when we stop listening to that voice, when the mania of our chaos of our lives get in the way of that voice.

(01:17:42):
And so whenever our founders face one of those moments, it's not a framework, it's not a playbook, or even a directed piece of advice from us to say, "You should just go left. I've seen this before. Go left." Nope. I trust founder intuition. If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in. We're just here to support them. And we try and be the only person in their life that is fully on their team because we're not on the preferred side of the CAFS table. We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, "Can you get really quiet?"

(01:18:21):
And the founder you're talking about, I have the story in my head, he was facing a breakup moment with his co-founder, and I asked him, because he's good at getting quiet, "What did the voice say to you way back when?" And the voice said to him, "This is the wrong fit. This isn't going to work. He believes in different things than I do, and that's going to go badly." But the lizard brain didn't want to believe that, and so it took another year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:58):
Wow. I had tingles throughout that entire piece of advice. I love how it's also very applicable to just life, not even just being a founder. It's a good reminder to trust that voice more. It's interesting that this also connects to founder-mode a little bit, and I'm curious how you think about that where a lot of the founder-mode advice is like trust your judgment, don't hire people to delegate things away. Do you see a difference in the core idea of founder-mode and just like, but you should actually trust your intuition more?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:19:35):
Intuition comes from, in my point of view, a deep understanding of self, and the capacity to get quiet and be well resourced, meaning you've slept well and you've eaten well and you have enough love in your world. And I think what founder-mode can confuse is my intuition says I should just do this job for them and fire these three people. That's not intuition, that's reaction, that's a fear response. And when the founder says, "I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it. I need to terminate my whole go-to-market team and start over. This isn't working, and I have data that supports it, but I know this isn't working." I'm like, "Let's go with that. I'm in. Let's do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
And I think you described a lot of times people feel this, and it takes a year, two years, three years, many years to actually realize that. And your advice here is try to listen to that more and trust it more. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, Jonathan to pivot our energy, is there anything else want to leave listeners with, last piece of advice, anything that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:21:04):
To be a founder is a state of being. It's an attitude, it's courage, it's instinct, it's a capacity to push through, despite all sorts of evidence suggesting you're wasting your time. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be. And so what I would encourage every founder out there that wants to go build something substantial, go work on your craft in addition to working on the business. Be honest with yourself about here's the shit I'm bad at. I don't know how to read a financial statement. My board meetings suck. Half my meetings that I have with my leadership team we all walk out of there saying what did we just accomplish right now? Or I get to the end of my workday and I'm like, I didn't get anything done. Those are all examples of just not taking the craft seriously enough. I'll leave with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
I love that. And I think I've made the mistake during our conversation of confusing founder and CEO and assuming they're the same thing, and I really appreciate you just again pointing out to folks that that's the big distinction you got to start making is there's the founder and there's the CEO. Often they're same person, but different parts of your brain and different skill sets.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:36):
And I'm now fully off the very awkward soapbox I've been sitting on for a long time, so we can go to lightning round whenever you're ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lighting round. Jonathan, are you ready?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:48):
I'm ready. I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):
First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:54):
My number one business book that I've recommended would be Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. I do think it always comes back to team. The right team can solve all the things. And that book is a beautiful distillation of the most common problematic archetypes that show up in a leadership group. So that's the number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):
Amazing. Anything else you'd recommend?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:19):
The second one, it goes more personal. It's a book called Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. It was, at least for me, the first introduction to this idea that I am not my brain and that my brain can be a tool that serves me well, and at times doesn't. So that would be number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
I've started to read that book and then I never finished it, so this is a good reminder to give it another shot. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:50):
I just watched and really enjoyed, because by the way, I have a three-year-old at home, so the amount of content I now consume is reduced tremendously. Well, my wife and I just watched Will & Harper. This is the documentary between Will Ferrell and his very dear friend who just recently transitioned. They road trip across the country together, and it was freaking delightful. It was sweet and endearing and one of the better things I've watched in a while.

(01:24:19):
TV show, Slow Horses, I'm utterly addicted. I'm only midway through season two, but I've been voraciously sleeping less and watching more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:31):
I love both those. I just watched Will & Harper, and completely agree with your sentiment about it. I wasn't planning to watch it. My mother-in-Law started watching. I'm like, wow, this is really fun. It's also funny, meaningful funny.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:24:43):
There's so many moments in it that are really sweet. As an aside, this was '20, I don't know, April 2020, and a group of our very close friends said, "Hey, how are we going to keep in touch?" And so we started what we called Movie Club, and we routinely either pick a TV show or a movie. We all watch separately and every two weeks we get together on Zoom at night, we talk about what we just watched.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:07):
And some have been great, some have been terrible. But Will & Harper was our most recent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Oh, such a cool tradition. Okay, we'll keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:21):
Two, and one is I'm going to talk my own book, but I still love it. The first one is Aura Frames. These are digital picture frames. They're amazing. The UX for them is incredible, the quality of it, they're pieces of artwork. So grandparents, in-laws, parents, we have multiple in our house, just love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
Just to clarify, it's a frame that has picked digital photos and you can give it to your mom and show photos of your kid wherever they live. Is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:55):
And the combination of the ease of the software and the quality of the imagery is better than anything I've tried, and I've tried a bunch of them. A-U-R-A Frames, and this is not an Enjoy The Work company. This is just one I'm a giant fan of.

(01:26:08):
The second one is an Enjoy The Work company called Augie Studio. A-U-G-I-E Studio. This is Canva for video. It can turn anyone with no engineering skills whatsoever, no code video creation, with full editing tools. So suddenly you can create branded high fidelity, high quality commercial video in minutes, with no effort. It's amazing. It was built by two media tech co-founders that were building this thing pre-ChatGPT, and it's just growing like this, and it's super fun, and the guys are great. So A-U-G-I-E Studio.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):
Sounds amazing. Augie Studio, I could use that. That sounds awesome. Two more questions. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work on in life?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:27:04):
The first one, and the one that I probably most commonly refer to, is that there is only one life. The quick backstory, and I know it's a lightning round, but I'm guilty of these stories. I went for a walk with a girlfriend of mine a bunch of years ago. And we did this once a month and we would always have a pretty typical ritual of giving each other life updates to begin the walk. And so I started the conversation with, "So there's the family update and then there's my work life and then there's my social life." She's like, "No, no, no, no, no, stop. That's all bullshit. It's one life. Stop assuming that there are these pretend walls between them or among them." I've lived that ever since.

(01:27:42):
So I try and show up. That phrase lets me show up the same way, no matter my setting. If you and I were having a beer or a meal, or if I'm sitting with one of my co-founders or clients, it doesn't matter, I show up the same way everywhere. Part of the way I enjoy the work is by having a real friendship, a real intimacy with everyone at Enjoy The Work, and including our clients as well, I want that level of conversation. I don't want the sterile stuff over here with my work environment versus my personal versus my family. It's just one version of me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:15):
And the phrase is, it's just one life.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:17):
Just one life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):
It's just one life. Final question. So you ran a casino at one point, I believe, and it was like a Harrah's Casino, is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:28):
My first career was in the casino business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:31):
But before I go on, what's the question?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:32):
The question is just is there a fun story, or experience, or lesson from that time in your life that might be fun to share? Maybe a mob involvement, or cheating, or something? I imagine that's a unique life experience.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:48):
I'll tell one of my favorite family stories then briefly. But yes, my family goes back in casino gambling in one form or another, several generations. My great-grandmother ran a illicit poker game. My grandfather ran numbers out of a gas station. My father's been in the casino industry since Atlantic City in the 70s. My sister is a prominent gaming attorney, and I worked in the industry for a dozen years, so this is my family. And Lenny, I didn't know any of this was weird until I was in my mid 20s.

(01:29:18):
I turned 21, and I'm old, yes, I'm going to just hide the year. I'm kidding. Anyway, I turned 21 and we take a family trip to Las Vegas because that was normal for us. My father was doing a lot of work out there, so he got us hotel rooms, etc. I'd never been there before, and I was newly 21 and so my parents said, "You have $300 to gamble with. We're going to be here for five days." This is a vacation. My grandparents are coming in. My uncle and aunt were coming in, and they're encouraging me, "This is all up to you, but try not to lose it all on night number one," which was good advice to give me. I was 21 and I was pretty much a schmuck at the time. But also, part of my experience being there was to interview for a summer internship. I was a college going to be junior.

(01:30:06):
So we go and I immediately go sit at some table and start playing some games. And I turn $300 into a few thousand dollars in the very first evening. And that was exciting and it was crazy and it was wild, et cetera. On the third night, which happens to everyone who goes to Vegas for too long, we're all delirious because all of us are staying up all night and being silly and being stupid. And my parents ask me, by the way, this is pre-cell phones, they ask me, "Hey, can you stay awake? Your uncle and aunt are going to arrive late tonight. They'll call the room. You can come down and just greet them and say hello?" Sure. So I get the phone call like 11: 30 at night. Go on downstairs, they're here. I go downstairs in the casino floor. We're staying at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's since been renamed, but I go downstairs and I can't find them anywhere. I think, okay, well I have cash in my pocket and I'm now awake so I might as well gamble.

(01:30:53):
Shortly thereafter, Lenny, I have an experience that happens one in 369,000 occurrences, and I win $35,421.92. For the trip I ended up winning $40,000 that I turned $300 to, and I was just 21 years old, which has left me with one of my mantras that I've had for the rest of my life, which some people roll their eyes at, but that is gambling does pay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:20):
I love that you remember the exact amount. What games did you end up playing that helped you win so much money?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:27):
The primary game that I played was Caribbean Stud Poker, where there's no skill of any kind. You get five cards, the dealer gets five cards, whoever wins wins, and if you have particularly unusual hands you get odds on the hand. And I got dealt 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of spades in five cards.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:44):
I thought you'd say slots or something. I love that you're just sitting there playing poker and went from $300 to $40,000.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:51):
It's not even real poker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):
That was a great story. I'm glad I went there. Jonathan, this was incredible. I think we've helped a lot of founders through this conversation. Two final questions. Where can folks find you guys? Who would be a good fit? What should people know about Enjoy the Work? And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:32:10):
Love that. So let me unpack those three. The first one is enjoythework.com, or just find me on LinkedIn. I'm not hard to find. Send us a note.

(01:32:22):
Who should ping us is very simple. If you're a founder out there, or a CEO out there, and you know in your heart that there's some gap between how you're running the business and how the company's going, and how it could be going, and how you could be running the business, if there's some gap there, we're here to help. Now our expertise, as we talked about in this call, is company building. So if you just have an idea on a napkin or you have a science experiment that you're not sure, we're useless, that's not us. But if you have some breadcrumbs worth following, like the business is starting to work, you're a series A into B and beyond, and you know that there's better, you can see it, that's where we help. Send us a note. Love to chat.

(01:33:06):
How can listeners be useful to us? So we are ferocious readers. All we try and do is study how do the best startups do X? From tiny things, like how do they run all hands meetings or off sites to the big meta topics of what is going to repeatable go-to-market even mean? Or what is financial planning in a way that's useful? Or how do you set goals that won't make you roll your eyes? We consistently learn from the ecosystem of podcasters and authors and journalists, like, go look at this material. So if your listeners have a favorite X on whatever topic in running a startup, send them my way. All we love to do is read and chew on that stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:54):
Awesome. And the best way to send that is either through Enjoy the Work or LinkedIn.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:33:58):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):
Awesome. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:34:02):
Lenny, this was so damn fun. Thanks for listening to my crazy casino stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:07):
I want to hear more, but we got to go. Bye everyone.

# Managing nerves, anxiety, and burnout | Jonny Miller (Nervous Systems Mastery)

## Transcript

Jonny Miller (00:00:00):
I have this idea that I call the feather brick dump truck phenomenon, and basically what that means is when we are showing early signs of burnout, our body will give us feedback usually in subtle ways in the beginning. So the feather might be waking up in the morning and feeling a little bit tired, maybe a little bit exhausted. The brick, maybe you ignore that or you don't notice it, and then three or four weeks later, you have a fight with someone or an argument, or you just feel frustrated and terrible and you lose your cool. And then maybe the dump truck is a month later, or even a year later, there's a full-blown health crisis, or you develop type two diabetes or there's a whole range of things, or maybe you get fired. Ideally, you want to notice when it's the feather and then make adjustments or shift then and not have to wait until you experience the full-blown pain of the dump truck, which unfortunately is what happens to a lot of people, especially when they experience burnout for the first time.

Lenny (00:01:02):
Today, my guest is Jonny Miller. Jonny teaches courses and does one-on-one coaching with tech professionals helping them with something he calls Nervous System Mastery, which is essentially a set of tools and techniques for cultivating calm, upgrading your resilience, and increasing your aliveness. If you can get better at dealing with stressful situations, avoiding burnout and being more confident in meetings and big presentations, it becomes a superpower and a huge advantage in both business and in life. I actually read a post by Jonny about a year ago, and it totally changed the way that I think about nervousness and stress, and I still apply many of his lessons today.

(00:01:41):
In our conversation, we dive deep into Jonny's key insights. We talk about why the best way to stay calm in stressful situations is to focus on the state of your body and not your mind. How to create calm and confidence by changing the state of your body through breath. Jonny shares a bunch of very specific breathing exercises for creating calm and also for creating energy that we actually try out on the podcast. We also get into a bunch of advice for how to tell if you're seeing early signs of burnout, how to release emotional debt that you may be feeling. Also, why feeling the feels gives you a competitive advantage in business. Also, a practice called APE, which reminds you to focus on your awareness, your posture, and your emotions that have started practicing ever since our chat and so much more.

(00:04:34):
Jonny, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Jonny Miller (00:04:37):
It's great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:38):
So I read this post that you wrote, I think it was over a year ago at this point. It was called The Operating Manual for Your Nervous System, and first of all, blew my mind when I read it. Second of all, I always think about it when I get nervous or anxious in a situation, it's really stuck with me. And I know that people in the workplace often get nervous and anxious doing all hand presentations, meetings, performance reviews, all the things. So I thought it'd be awesome just to dive into the stuff that you've uncovered about how we can become less nervous and less anxious. Before we get into the meat of it, I'd love to just spend a couple minutes just getting a sense of why you got into this stuff. What actually got you to spend so much of your energy and life force trying to understand how the nervous system works, how to get people to be less nervous and anxious.

Jonny Miller (00:05:27):
My story starts in I kind of have a background in tech. I had a startup, we went through Techstars back in 2012. About five and a half years into that experience, I went through burnout, which is pretty common in the startup world, but that actually wasn't the trigger for me. I find that usually people that get into this type of work, there's some kind of catalyst or some kind of challenging life event. And for me, that was October 23rd, 2017, and my fiance at the time had an anxiety attack and she took her own life. And that completely just destroyed me at the time. And I realized that I'd been so disconnected from my body and my emotions, and it sent me on this five plus year journey to discover all of this inner landscape that I'd been numb from the neck down, and I went into breathwork meditation retreats, did hundreds of breathwork journeys, researched with a breath lab over in Bali, and basically just kind of directed all of my focus and attention onto understanding this inner landscape that I'd been pretty much oblivious to. And since then, I've been working with founders, executives, running courses and teaching what I'm learning and hopefully still researching at the same time as well.

Lenny (00:06:52):
Wow. And I imagine the thinking was that if your wife had these skills, she would've had another path.

Jonny Miller (00:07:00):
Yeah, that was definitely part of it, yeah. And also just since realizing how many people are struggling with anxiety, depression, all of this kind of constellation of mental health challenges both in the workplace and at home as well. And yeah, it's been a very rewarding journey.

Lenny (00:07:19):
All right, this episode's already gotten very heavy and I'm sucked in. I'm excited to learn all these things that you've uncovered. So let's just get into the meat of it. Just talk about this kind of general method that you've found for how to help people become less nervous and anxious.

Jonny Miller (00:07:38):
So I find this top down, bottom up distinction to be incredibly helpful. Most people when they try to calm down, they use tactical reframes or maybe mindfulness or maybe reframing the situation in a positive light. There's lots of different practices that people use which do have some effect. But in my experience, working with the physiology, using what's known as a bottom up approach, primarily using the breath, although there's also other approaches that you can use, it's just such a rapidly more effective way of shifting your state.

(00:08:11):
 And to give a little bit of context and maybe some science as well, we have what's known as afferent and efferent neurons going up and down our body, and there's four times more afferent neurons going from the body to the brain as from the brain to the body. So you can almost imagine there's a super highway of traffic of information going up to the brain and four times less going from the brain to the body. And so by learning how to pull on the levers of our physiology, we can rapidly change our state. And then from there, by changing our state, that impacts the thoughts and feelings that we have. So instead of trying to change the story or trying to fix something or trying to solve something, which is what most people do by default, myself included in the past, if you change your state first, then there's a cascading effect which changes your thoughts and your feelings.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Okay, amazing. Yeah, and just to share how I felt when I was reading this and try to understand this approach is whenever I get nervous, there's always this like, oh, my body's starting to feel anxious. And then I think of a reason. Oftentimes, I don't know why it gets nervous, why my body's starting to create this feeling of anxiety. And then I often realize I'm just now trying to just explain why it happened, "Oh, I have this big meeting coming up, or I have this podcast episode I'm nervous about, or I'm not going to make a deadline for my newsletter." I often experience this where it's just like, "Oh, something feels nervous." And then, "Okay, here's the explanation." So maybe just along those lines, what else is there that might be helpful for people to think about in this context?

Jonny Miller (00:09:47):
I mean, I think it's helpful to understand the process by which, by changing the way that we breathe, for example, it shifts our physiological state and changes our nervous system. So if you're listening to this, maybe you, Lenny, you can try this as well. If you start breathing into your upper chest and shallow fairly, fairly rapid, maybe even through the mouth, that will then there's a part of your brain called the insular cortex, which is basically constantly spying on the way that we're breathing and it will register that change, it will then send information to activate the endocrine system, which then creates shift in our blood chemistry. The sympathetic nervous system gets activated and that increase in adrenaline and cortisol starts to flood your body. Everyone's probably very familiar with that feeling. And then that will then have a cascading impact on the thoughts that you're having and the way that you feel. And so you just shared, we have a tendency to kind of confabulate or make up stories that match the state that we are in. And so that's kind of what happens when we're breathing in that way. And then you can also consciously change your breath to breathe in a different way, which has the reverse effects, which I can go into, but I'll pause there.

Lenny (00:11:05):
Yeah. So I think one of the big actionable takeaways here is that instead of trying to convince yourself, "No, this talk is going to go great, I don't need to worry about how I'm going to look in this meeting." Basically instead of going top down, trying to calm your body through thought, your advice is calm your body first because then your mind will notice, "Hey, I'm actually not as nervous as I thought. Maybe things are going to be okay." Is that right?

Jonny Miller (00:11:29):
Yeah, precisely. And I mean I've used this myself many times before presentations. I gave a TEDx talk a few years ago and I was like my entire body, I was just terrified. And I did in 15 minutes of this breathing practice before and walked on stage almost cool as a cucumber. It's very effective.

Lenny (00:11:47):
Sounds too good to be true. But we're going to do some of these exercises for people. Before we get into, why is it that breath specifically so powerful? It feels like such a strange thing to work so well, just this idea of breathing in a different way. You talked a bit about this, I forget what you called it, that kind of watches how you're breathing. But I guess what else can you share about just why is breath so effective in changing our state?

Jonny Miller (00:12:10):
Sure. Well, it's one of the few things which happens automatically, but we can also control it consciously. And so what scientists have discovered that when the exhale is twice as long as the inhale, it has a calming effect. And when the inhale is either more intense or twice as long as the exhale, it has an activating effect. So you can kind of think of this as an up or down lever on the nervous system.

Lenny (00:12:36):
You also have this really clever way of describing this system. You call it state over story, essentially focusing on the state of your body versus the story you're telling yourself. Is that the way to think about it? And can you just talk about that concept?

Jonny Miller (00:12:48):
Yeah, so it's basically a shorthand for what we've just been talking about, which is most people tend to approach the problem or try to solve things on the level of story. So there's multiple ways you can do that through the breath as we just talked about. You can also defocus your gaze and kind of relax your eyes, and that has a similar effect. It can expand your awareness and kind of bring your awareness to behind you and the sides of you and below you, or you can breathe in these ways which emphasize the exhale. And so when we breathe in a way with say the exhale twice as long as the inhale, that part of the brain, the insular cortex then sends signals to the parasympathetic nervous system, which then has the cascading effect on our endocrine system and calms us down. And what I usually find as well is that the kind of reactive thoughts and feelings that we have when we are in that kind of anxious loop, they can be self-reinforcing. And so if someone has a thought of like, "Oh no, I'm nervous before this important presentation." Then that exacerbates the breathing pattern and then the whole thing just goes into this spiral, which can end up in full-blown panic attacks if there's not an intervention of some sorts.

Lenny (00:13:57):
Yeah, that's what I find with my nerves. I hate talking on stage. I get nervous before every podcast. This is not my natural state.

Jonny Miller (00:14:04):
Interesting.

Lenny (00:14:05):
Yeah, and I hide it well.

Jonny Miller (00:14:07):
Is that still the case with podcast today?

Lenny (00:14:09):
Absolutely. And it's like different levels of nervousness, but it's always just like, "Oh, there we go." I'm not a performer person. Even I kind of push myself to do this podcast as a way to get better at this, to be honest. So it's still a thing that I think about. And what I find is the nervousness comes from exactly what you described is the nervousness of being nervous. I don't know, there's no reason specifically to be anxious, but I don't know how I'll be once I do the thing. So it's nervous of what it might look like or end up being like. So that's exactly what I ran into.

Jonny Miller (00:14:41):
Yeah. And there's obviously people say mindfulness, meditation, things like that, that can increase the psychological space between stimulus and response. And that is something that obviously does help over the long term, but it's in my opinion, nowhere near as rapid and effective and efficient as just changing the way that you're breathing.

Lenny (00:15:00):
Awesome. So let's get into it. I know you have a couple exercises specifically for this, and then we'll go from there.

Jonny Miller (00:15:06):
We can stack a few of the exercises and I'll try and keep it to a minute or so. So yeah, if you want to get comfy in your chair and sit up straight, feel your butt on the seat, and I find it helpful to kind of be aware of the space behind you and above you as well, kind of expanding your awareness so that you are aware of the space behind to the sides and above.

Lenny (00:15:29):
And should we close your eyes?

Jonny Miller (00:15:31):
Yeah, and close your eyes down. If you're listening and driving, obviously don't do that. But yeah, closing the eyes down for sure helps. And now we're just going to do simple breath. We're going to inhale in through the nose for four. We're going to hold the breath at the top for four, and we're going to exhale for eight, and then we're going to repeat. So let the breath go and inhaling through the nose. Inhale, 2, 3, 4, hold the breath, 2, 3, 4. And exhale, 8, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Inhale, 2, 3, 4, hold the breath, 2, 3, 4, and exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. And now you can let go of the breath completely and we'll end with one round of humming, which is surprisingly effect of it calming as well. So take a full breath in and humming through the nose all the way to the end of exhale. Let out a sigh if that feels good and open up your eyes.

Lenny (00:17:01):
I feel extremely calm. I should do this every podcast episode before we start.

Jonny Miller (00:17:08):
A note on the humming. It also releases nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator, and that helps to create that kind of calming effect and it also reduces eye tension as well. So I'll do it if I've been looking to screen for too long. It's really good for kind of reducing eye fatigue as well.

Lenny (00:17:24):
And there's also a vagus nerve component to it because your body's vibrating, is that true?

Jonny Miller (00:17:28):
Yeah, precisely. So it kind of tones or stimulates the vagus nerve, which stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system.

Lenny (00:17:35):
What's your advice for doing this? Is this before you go into a big meeting or a presentation? How do you apply this?

Jonny Miller (00:17:42):
I kind of like to share building a toolkit of different practices that are appropriate for different contexts. So something like the 4, 4, 8 breathing, you could do pretty much anywhere without anyone necessarily noticing. Humming is slightly more obvious, but if you're about to jump on a zoom or something, you can totally do it with your eyes closed. Things like expanding your awareness or bringing your awareness down to your feet and your hands, which creates a kind of grounding calming effect that also you can do if you're in a busy room. Maybe you have social anxiety, even orienting and labeling things that you are hearing and feeling, kind of bringing the awareness and attention back into the body that also has an effect. And then there's longer practices for say, non-sleep deep rests, belly breathing, things that you can do if you have 10, 20 minutes and you're at home and you want a downshift.

(00:18:30):
So I like to kind of give people a big toolkit to see what works for them and then cherry-pick which ones are suitable to different situations. And another way that I think about this is, I call it, if this, then breathe. So it's like if I feel overwhelmed, then I do the humming. If I feel anxious, then I do 4, 4, 8 breathing or alternate nostril breathing and kind of having my own little recipe set that I have for different context is really helpful and I work with people to kind of build those toolkits themselves.

Lenny (00:19:03):
This sounds like it needs to be a website where people can go with these lists of if this, then that is there a place that we could send people in the show notes and if not, you should make one before we go live.

Jonny Miller (00:19:13):
There is not currently. It's part of the curriculum in the course that I have, but-

Lenny (00:19:17):
Okay, great.

Jonny Miller (00:19:18):
... I can maybe see if I can spin one up as well, but yeah.

Lenny (00:19:21):
Okay, cool. We'll link to the course if nothing else. Amazing.

Jonny Miller (00:19:23):
Okay.

Lenny (00:19:24):
Along this line of calming breath exercise, Huberman also has a different version, which I've tried and I'm going to do both now. You breathe in fully and then you breathe in a little bit more. I imagine you've seen that piece of advice?

Jonny Miller (00:19:37):
That's also fantastic. He calls it the physiological sigh, and it's both very effective, especially if you just have five seconds and you just take a full sigh, it's great. I'd also add that the sigh happens naturally as a result of doing these downshifting practices. So if you notice after you do let's say the 4, 4, 8 breathing, at the end, you might naturally just want to let out a sigh, and that's a signal that your body is naturally downshifting. Or if you are with a friend and you feel just comfortable and relaxed, then your body might sigh. And it's something that we do a lot and as you say, you can consciously do it and that will help as well. That's another one of the practices.

Lenny (00:20:18):
Awesome. So link to that. And I think throughout this episode, as you said, we're going to give people a bunch of tools that they can use, and it feels like some are in the moment, "I need to feel calmer right now. Here's a thing you could do." And then there's things you can do ongoing that build... I guess another way to think about it's just make your body more calm as a baseline of practice to work on there.

Jonny Miller (00:20:38):
Yeah, precisely.

Lenny (00:20:39):
Awesome, okay. I think the other breathing exercise we're going to do is the opposite. Gets you all excited, is that right?

Jonny Miller (00:20:45):
Yeah, sure. We can do that as well. I call this espresso breath. So this is the opposite. This is very activating. I would only recommend this if you're feeling lethargic or maybe instead of drinking a coffee in the afternoon, you could do this for a minute or so. In the scientific literature, it's bellows breath or breath of fire, and it basically looks like a series of rapid exhales through the nose. I like to keep it through the nose only if you do it through the mouth, it can be very too activating and it can kind of overwhelm people. Obviously, there's the Wim Hof practice that I'm sure many people are familiar with. So this is a more gentle version of... If Wim Hof is like Red Bull, this is kind of like a small coffee.

Lenny (00:21:30):
I like that. And you call it the espresso breath, espresso breath.

Jonny Miller (00:21:33):
Espresso breath, yeah.

Lenny (00:21:33):
So yeah, that's a good metaphor there.

Jonny Miller (00:21:35):
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, let's do it. So again, kind of sit up straight, and this time you want to be pumping the breath from your lower belly and you pump the breath on the exhale. So I'll demonstrate it briefly. It's like breathe in.

(00:21:56):
Okay. So yeah, take a full breath in and begin.

(00:21:58):
And let go. And full breath in. And sigh on the exhale. I already feel a little bit tingly.

Lenny (00:22:25):
I'm energized. Let's do this. Go, go, go, go. That was great. Okay, look at that. We're back to where we started with the full circle of energy. That was great.

Jonny Miller (00:22:34):
Up and down.

Lenny (00:22:35):
And then how long do you recommend doing that one for?

Jonny Miller (00:22:38):
So it kind of depends on how activating you find it, but I usually find 30 breaths per round and then take a breath, have a long pause on the exhale, and then if you want to do another round or two.

Lenny (00:22:50):
Amazing. And the cases where this might be helpful is maybe you're about to give a big talk, I guess in a talk you both want energy and want calm, so that's kind of complicated.

Jonny Miller (00:22:59):
Especially if you are meetings early in the morning and you haven't quite got going yet, you can do the espresso breath to begin with and that activates you. And then do some of the downshifting practices to kind of ground and stabilize that aliveness.

Lenny (00:23:12):
Are there any other tactical breathing exercises that are worth doing real quick? I know we'll get into some longer practices and deeper stuff, but is there anything else that would be helpful here?

Jonny Miller (00:23:21):
No, I think we've covered the bases. I don't want to overwhelm people too much.

Lenny (00:23:25):
Just as a takeaway, there's these two techniques. One to help you get more calm when you need to be calm in the moment. The other is to get energy. And then I guess are these things that you recommend doing ongoing to build this muscle in your body or are these mostly for you need this now in the moment and it's not worth just doing a few times a day even when you're fine?

Jonny Miller (00:23:47):
Yeah, great question. So I like to recommend both a morning practice, particularly to build the muscle of just doing it and getting used to it. So maybe five minutes in the morning before you start work, before breakfast, something like that. And then you are more likely to remember that you have access to that in the moment because usually the challenge is that when someone is in that flustered state, remembering to do the practice is often the last thing that comes to mind. So by having a deliberate practice for at least 7 to 10 days and so that you get the hang of it, then it feels much more natural to do it when you're feeling. That's kind of like playing the game on hard mode when you are really stressed and anxious, that's when you need it the most, but it's also when you're least likely to remember to do it.

Lenny (00:24:36):
Awesome. Okay, so the first exercise to calm you down is essentially breathe in four seconds, hold it for four seconds, breathe out slowly for eight seconds and do that for about 30 seconds, is that right? Or for a minute?

Jonny Miller (00:24:48):
Yeah, I'd say for at least a minute or two. We kind of did a shorter version. I'll also add that the important thing is that the exhale is twice as long as the inhale. So if exhaling for eight is too long, you could do 3, 3, 6 or even 2, 2, 4 or even 5, 5, 10 depending on your lung capacity essentially and your CO2 tolerance.

Lenny (00:25:08):
Okay, good to know. And then the espresso breath, when you need energy or you just kind of pump air out of your belly through your nose and you do that for how long would you recommend?

Jonny Miller (00:25:18):
Two to three rounds of 30 pumps, yeah.

Lenny (00:25:22):
And again, the reason this is effective and powerful is coming back to your original big insight that our state is driven by what our body is doing and our mind often explains what we're feeling based on what our body's doing. So that if you can change the state of your body and become less nervous in your body, your mind will be like, "All right, everything's fine."

Jonny Miller (00:25:45):
Yeah. And maybe something that we haven't touched on yet, but I think is important to add in is this idea of interoception or somatic awareness. And the reason I bring it in is because if you do this practice but you're not really aware of your body and how you feel, then it'll be less compelling to you. But if you're kind of tuned into like sensations in your body, what's going on, you're more likely to notice the difference in the shifts.

Lenny (00:26:09):
Great. So let's get into that. That was something I definitely wanted to touch on here. This awesome acronym to help you with this process of interoception. So talk about what that is and then how to actually go about becoming better at being aware of what your body's doing.

Jonny Miller (00:26:22):
Yeah. So it's this idea of interoception, which is known as our sixth sense, and basically it's our ability to sense, track and feel our internal landscape. And I like to use the metaphor of a chef in the same way that you train your flavor palette for kind of sweet, spicy, umami, things like that. You can also train your interoceptive palette and become more aware of the internal sensations, whether that's your breath, whether it's tension, whether it's moods and emotions, whether it's the quality of your awareness, the quality of your thoughts. And the more kind of in tune with that you are, the more likely you are to notice the kind of early warning signs of something like anxiety. Because usually, certainly a panic attack doesn't come out of nowhere. There will be a kind of cascade of subtle things that happen in your body that eventually result in anxiety. And so if you can catch those things early and kind of nip them in the bud and do one of these practices, then you can avoid the kind of 10 out of 10 worst case scenarios.

Lenny (00:27:25):
Okay, awesome. So I know that there's also specific things you recommend people pay attention to, to understand what their body is doing in this process of inter...

Jonny Miller (00:27:33):
Interoception, yeah,

Lenny (00:27:34):
Interra... Okay. What is it?

Jonny Miller (00:27:36):
Interoception.

Lenny (00:27:39):
Interoception.

Jonny Miller (00:27:39):
As opposed to exteroception, which is awareness of all the external stimuli.

Lenny (00:27:44):
Got it. I guess before we even get to that, so you mentioned that it's another sense we have, and I think that's a really important point that I think maybe people didn't catch. So we have these five senses, obviously taste and smell and vision and touch. But you're finding and research showed basically this is another sense people don't really know we have.

Jonny Miller (00:28:02):
Yeah, exactly. And it has been studies quite a lot, especially in the last decade or so. And there's a number of interesting findings from the research that I found. One being that ADHD tends to correlate with low levels of interoception, as does if people have PTSD or trauma. Again, interoception is lowered. And I'd certainly say for myself, for the first 25 years of my life, I was fairly numb from the neck down. I was not very aware to what was happening in my body in real time. I was also reading a book recently called The Hour Between Dog and Wolf, which looked at Wall Street traders and they correlated higher degrees of interception with basically making more money and making better decisions. And I think the thesis was that by tuning into what their body was doing in certain moments, they could pick up on things more intuitive decision making essentially.

Lenny (00:28:55):
So I think there's a specific list of things that you recommend people pay attention to, their posture, their breath, things like that. What is that list and then how do we actually do this better?

Jonny Miller (00:29:06):
Yeah. So I simplify this to APE, which basically is an acronym which stands for awareness, posture, and emotion. So to kind of go through each one by one. Awareness is, to give an example, I could narrow my awareness and become really focused and just you kind of tense up and it also is quite activating sometimes or you can relax and expand your awareness and be aware of the space above me, the space behind me, the space below me. And that is generally a calming thing. Posture is fairly self-explanatory. But again, our posture affects how we feel. You're shifting there now. And then emotion, which I include somatic or body-based sensations which arise. So both kind of what is the overall mood and the flavor or the texture that I'm feeling. Like right now, maybe it's excitement, maybe there's some joy. I'm noticing there's some heat in my belly probably from the breathing. Yeah, there's a little bit of tightness in my lower back from working out yesterday. So just sense kind of mapping that landscape of sensation. And for most people it's almost like it's like a [inaudible 00:30:22]. You have those maps of [inaudible 00:30:25] and for a lot of people there's just these big kind blind spots in their body.

Lenny (00:30:30):
And the advice here is, so there's this acronym APE and the advice is think about these three things when you're feeling something that you may not, basically something's going on slash just often come back to this. I imagine just whenever you can think of, "Oh, APE: awareness, posture, emotion." Is that how to use this?

Jonny Miller (00:30:51):
Yeah, exactly. So again, it can be something that you do before you start your day, maybe with a cup of tea. I like to drink tea and just do a body scan essentially and just check each of those three areas. And it's really valuable, particularly if you are having racing thoughts or something doesn't feel quite right. Instead of just tackling the problem on the level of the mind dropping down into the body and bringing that into the picture as well, I find to be really helpful.

Lenny (00:31:26):
Basically, as often as you can. And generally when things are feeling all off, just remember APE, where's my awareness? How's my posture? And then what am I feeling? Am I feeling sad? Am I feeling happy, excited, angry? Things like that. I think you also talk about breath, like you have a list you wrote about this of other things that you might want to pay attention to. Actually finding paying attention to what my breath is doing is really powerful too. So I'm going to try a BAPE version of this or I'm going to try to think about where's my breath coming from, what am I feeling there?

Jonny Miller (00:32:02):
Yeah. So the breath and sensations are two other ones that are really helpful. The breath in particular, often people will... There's an idea of email apnea when people are checking their emails, they will, without noticing it, start to hold their breath, which is generally a very activating thing to do. Or as I mentioned earlier, if your breath is through the mouth and shallow and into the upper chest, that will also be very activating versus is your breath through the nose? Is it kind of into the belly and into the sides of the rib cage and does it feel easeful? Basically, breathing without tension is ideal.

Lenny (00:32:39):
What I think about using this practice is if I were sitting in a meeting and just not feeling amazingly confident, I just come back to this acronym, BAPE or APE, whichever one you want to choose, just like how am I feeling right now? Oh wow, my whole stomach is clenched. I'm maybe nervous about what might happen or I'm not breathing at all, or my posture is really bad. So I think in a meeting would be really helpful Here, maybe you're about to get on a zoom or an important call or something like that. Maybe a one-on-one. Is there anything else, any other moments that kind of triggers for people of like, "Oh, I should really be aware of what's happening right now. Let me do an APE exercise."

Jonny Miller (00:33:16):
Yeah, well, just to kind of piggyback on what you just said, if you are about to jump on a meeting and you're noticing that your stomach is clenched, that's actually really useful data to be like, "Why is this happening?" Is it your intuition kind of saying that maybe you shouldn't do this deal with someone or maybe something is off and so it's a sign to explore that more. Or it could be that you've been triggered by something or something that someone said and you've only just realized it and then that's again, more information or something that you can reflect on or go into.

Lenny (00:33:51):
Is there anything in your life recently that is an example of this where you're feeling unsure and maybe you realize, "Oh, here's what my body's doing, maybe I should pay more attention to this."

Jonny Miller (00:34:03):
Actually, last week I did a podcast conversation, so I have a podcast myself, and I got off the call and I remember I felt or got off the podcast and I felt pretty exhausted and I felt like there was this kind of tension in my chest. And again, my breath was kind of all over the place and I realized that I had very much over committed myself for that week. I'd scheduled back to back podcast interviews. The podcast wasn't even the priority for what I'm focusing on in this quarter, so I then made the decision to just push back all my episodes until the summer basically.

Lenny (00:34:42):
I love that example. I know that feeling very well.

Jonny Miller (00:34:46):
I'm sure.

Lenny (00:34:48):
When you wrote about this idea of interoception, you connected it to burnout, and I think you talked about how this is one of the best tools to avoid burnout. Is that right? Am I remembering that right? And if so, how do you think about this burnout and avoiding burnout in general, something a lot of people experience?

Jonny Miller (00:35:08):
Yeah, so I have this idea that I call the feather brick dump truck phenomenon. And basically what that means is when we are showing early signs of burnout, our body will give us feedback usually in subtle ways in the beginning. So the feather might be waking up in the morning and feeling a little bit tired, maybe a little bit exhausted. The brick, maybe you ignore that or you don't notice it, and then three or four weeks later you have a fight with someone or an argument or you just feel frustrated and terrible and you lose your cool. And then maybe the dump truck is a month later or even a year later, there's a full-blown health crisis, or you develop type two diabetes or there's a whole range of things, or maybe you get fired. There's a bunch of different things that can happen, but normally depending on how attuned or depending on someone's interoceptive capacity, ideally, you want to notice when it's the feather and then make adjustments or shift then and not have to wait until you experience the full-blown pain of the dump truck, which unfortunately is what happens to a lot of people, especially when they experience burnout for the first time.

Lenny (00:36:18):
This is such an important point and such a good way of thinking about it. It reminds me of Andy Johns and the episode we had there of just how long and willing to the episode there of just how all these little things came up along the way and then eventually just became incredibly unsustainable to live the life that he was living.

(00:37:40):
What are some examples of this feather? So your advice here is just pay attention to these little signs that you're not living a sustainable life right now. What are some examples of these kind of feathery signs of like maybe I need to change something?

Jonny Miller (00:37:55):
Yeah, so I'll tie this in with a concept that I call emotional debt, which is basically when our nervous system experiences stress, there's known as a mobilization cycle, and if that cycle isn't completed or we don't get to downshift or relax on the other side, that gets stored in the body as allostatic load, which I call emotional debt. And over time, that creates fragility in the nervous system. And so what that fragility can look like is anything from being impacted by small things in a kind of disproportionate way. So noticing that you are more reactive than normal, maybe you're a little bit more snappy, maybe you get frustrated by little things, maybe your sleep isn't as good, maybe you wake up not feeling fully rested. Maybe relationships are often, especially intimate relationships are usually a place that this shows up or relationships at work. So those are the classic early warning signs. And then as that emotional debt threshold increases in the same way that say with technical debt, if you're building a product in the beginning, it's fine, and in fact it's even necessary in the beginning. It's great that our body can buffer the stress response because it allows us to function. But if we don't pay off that technical debt or emotional debt, then over time it accumulates and it can also come out through health crises, health challenges. It just gets basically progressively worse until that debt is paid off.

Lenny (00:39:25):
I feel like a lot of people listening are like, "Yes, I know exactly what you mean." How does one notice that you're building emotional debt and then how do you start to release this debt and pay off this debt?

Jonny Miller (00:39:38):
What I've seen with some of my founder clients and in the research that we did where we interviewed 260 leaders, what can often happen is that emotional debt will increase and increase and increase until it gets to a point where we are well outside what's known as a window of tolerance. And at that point there's like a crash. It's almost like the fuse switch blows and there's exhaustion. Maybe there's complete inability to get up off the couch. And for some people, people with large nervous system capacity, they can keep going for five years, maybe 10 years, and they can keep building this up, and it becomes normalized to live in a way where you are always on and never really relaxing or coming down. Or one really key sign actually is if you are not able to naturally downshift or down regulate your nervous system at the end of the day without something like wine or CBD or some kind of external substance, that's a sign that you kind of reached a certain threshold of emotional debt.

Lenny (00:40:47):
And then how does one start to pay off this debt if you've spent years just working way too hard, you've had a relationship that just isn't working great, I don't know. I imagine most people go to therapy and just talk through all these things and try to work through the challenges. What do you recommend if you're just like, "Man, I feel like I have this, what should I do?"

Jonny Miller (00:41:08):
Yeah, well, I mean that's a big question. I'll probably get some pushback for this, but I'm not a big fan of talk therapy alone or at least therapy that doesn't have a somatic or body-based component. And from my understanding of the nervous system and how we store this stress, just talking about things and keeping things on the level of the intellect doesn't actually address the root of the challenge. What we need to do is create a certain sense of safety to kind of go into those buffered emotional responses and feel them all the way through and allow that mobilization reflex to complete.

(00:41:48):
And so to kind of give a personal example, when I was living in Bali, I did several hundred breathwork journeys where you breathe in a certain way to get into an altered state, and then in that place, these memories would arise of these things that happened 5, 10 years ago. And my body, it would either move a certain way or the anger would come through. Sometimes there would be sadness or grief. Often there's a lot of stored emotion that's held in our body that just needs permission to kind of be felt through and be released. And so for me, it was a journey of coming into right relationship with my anger and my grief, and honestly my shame as well, giving myself permission to feel this gunk that had been stored in my pelvis.

(00:42:35):
So I'm not saying you have to go to Bali and do 200 breathwork journeys. That's definitely not... I mean, that's a path. But first it begins with, as I said, cultivating interoception and even being aware that there is this tension, there are these things in your body. Secondly, having the practices of self-regulation so that if these things come up, you don't get overwhelmed. You're able to downshift and ground. And then thirdly, it's the practice of what I call emotional fluidity, which is basically creating the conditions of welcoming the full spectrum of emotions as they arise. And often it's very helpful to have a guide or a somatic practitioner, I like somatic experiencing, hakomi, the two modalities I'm a big fan of. And yeah, that's the journey and a process and it depends how many years you've been operating in a slightly numbed way, and it's different for everyone. But it begins by tuning into and listening to the body and then having honestly curiosity about what is there and just following that curiosity and the body starts to show you what is ready to be seen.

Lenny (00:43:49):
I love that it always comes back to the original place we started which is that the way we feel is a very bottom up body-based system, it's not we feel something and our body gets nervous. It's our body gets nervous, and they're like, "Oh, here's why I'm nervous." And your advice is just focus a lot on helping your body release the stuff that you've built up this debt. And then also just when you're nervous in the moment, focus on getting your body to a state versus trying to convince your mind now everything's going to be okay.

Jonny Miller (00:44:17):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:44:17):
And specifically on the therapy route, just to touch on that, so your advice there is if you were to work with a therapist and you feel a lot of this stuff that we're talking about is focused on a somatic oriented therapy where it's body oriented, not just thinking about it and talking through stuff, it's actually convincing your body, "Here's a way to helping your body release this debt, essentially."

Jonny Miller (00:44:40):
Yeah. I mean, you can understand in precise detail about whatever the challenge was from 5, 10 and 15 years ago, but if you're unable to connect it to the correlating sensations in the body... Usually if say, I don't know, if I was to imagine someone shouted at me yesterday and I think about that, there's usually a correlating kind of sematic sensation. The neuroscientist Damasio calls it a somatic marker. So by tracking the somatic markers and then either on your own just kind of following that sensation and allowing whatever emotion was present at the time to complete that is the way that we kind of slowly pay off that emotional debt by one process at a time.

Lenny (00:45:26):
So maybe coming back to this question of say someone is listening and wondering, am I building emotional debt? Am I ignoring things that are these feathers? What are signs and just, I don't know, examples of emotional debt being built up of this trauma, whatever you want to call it, being built up in the body? I don't know, is it just like anytime you feel really nervous, that's emotional debt? Is it anytime you push something down that you are pretty sure you should deal with in the moment, that's emotional debt? What are just some examples of what that feels like and looks like?

Jonny Miller (00:45:58):
Yeah, so it's typically different forms of nervous system dysregulation and that shows up as it could be someone's breathing pattern if they're constantly in this sympathetic or hypervigilant state, if they're always tracking for things, looking for the worst case scenario. Another common one, and this is particularly true in the tech sector, is being very much in the head and living in the thoughts and the mind the entire time. And there's a form of disassociation that happens as a kind of protection mechanism essentially because it's uncomfortable to be with the sensations in the body. And because our society tends to reward people for solving problems and being in their mind, that is a pattern that continues for many, many years or even decades.

(00:46:43):
Other ones are, I think the most obvious one for people is emotional reactivity, where your response to a certain situation is disproportionate to what's happened. So for example, if you said something to me of that doesn't make any sense, and I was like, I freeze maybe... And this is another important point that most people have two versions of reactivity. Some people will freeze, withdraw, shut down and disconnect, and other people will become more aggressive, become bigger and attack and fight back. And knowing which way you tend to orient, for me, it's usually shrink and freeze and shut down, knowing what your pattern is and also knowing what the sensations are when this happens, it's really helpful for you to be like, "Oh, that thing's happening." My priority now is to downshift and kind of find a sense of safety basically in the body and then interact, then make the decision, then have the conversation. Because if you can keep going from that place of reactivity, nothing good happens from that place. No great decisions were made from that place. So again, that's a place where having the interoceptive awareness to know, "Oh, this is what's going on." Being able to then downshift your system, kind of access a sense of, "Oh, I'm okay, actually this isn't so bad." And then moving on from there is a profoundly practical and just useful skill.

Lenny (00:48:14):
Kind of along these same lines, you wrote somewhere this idea that you have a big competitive advantage if you feel the feels is the way you described it. Does that ring a bell? And if so, what can you share around that, just why this is so powerful, especially in the workplace?

Jonny Miller (00:48:28):
Yeah, so I think I wrote about this in one of the Every essays. I think the title was The Best Decision-Making Is Emotional. And I basically wanted to kind of poke at the phrase, I think I saw someone on Twitter say, "Fact over feelings, like don't let emotions ruin good decision making." And yeah, there's so much that I can say about this. But basically there was a landmark study by this guy, Damasio, this kind of famous neuroscientist, and he studied a patient called Elliot. And Elliot had a tumor in his brain that was removed and it basically meant that he was unable to feel emotions. So his entire emotional capacity was removed. And Elliot went from being a successful married businessman to divorced, broke and unable to choose what he could have for lunch. He was unable to make the most basic life decisions, and it's because he didn't have access to that emotional sense in his brain.

(00:49:22):
And so our brain is like a prediction making machine, and as I mentioned earlier, there's this highway of sensory data that's coming up through the body. And if we don't listen to that when we are making decisions, then we're losing out on a lot of information. And what tends to happen, I see this in clients that I work with, is if they are avoiding feeling a certain way, let's say, that they don't enjoy feeling conflict or anger, then they will make decisions subconsciously to avoid feeling that way. And it becomes a huge bias and a huge problem because people make decisions because they're afraid of feeling a certain way. And if you are on the other hand able to just welcome and be with whatever emotions would arise on the other side of a decision, you're able to decide clearly instead of being skewed one way or the other.

Lenny (00:50:16):
Easier said than done.

Jonny Miller (00:50:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:50:21):
Do you find there's ever a downside to being too in touch with what you're feeling? I actually not a feeler of what I'm feeling kind of person. I'm pretty stable, partly because I'm not super in tune with what I'm feeling a lot of times, and maybe this is a huge problem that I need to deal with. But I don't know, it's worked out okay so far. I guess, do you ever find that sometimes it's okay, sometimes you don't need to know exactly every moment anything that's hurting you or causing you pain?

Jonny Miller (00:50:49):
Yeah, it's a good question. And some people do have a very high interoceptive capacity, and that can be overwhelming. In which case I would recommend focusing on the breathing practices to build that capacity to downshift, so you're able to just function. And there's definitely people who are overwhelmed by the stimuli of day-to-day life being out in traffic, like they're very easily overwhelmed. And for those people working on increasing nervous system capacity to kind of hold that amount of stress, maybe it's through sauna and cold plunge, maybe it's through gentle titration of stresses and then downshifting, that's actually really valuable.

(00:51:28):
I'd also say that the ability to function well, this applies to a lot of high functioning people, which is probably honestly a lot of your audience. It's very helpful in the moment to, let's say something comes up, you want to be able to buffer intense emotions and say, get through the meeting, get through whatever it is. It's a very helpful skill. But if you don't, then give yourself spaciousness afterwards to downshift and allow yourself to feel whatever was brought up by that experience, you are going to be adding to this emotional debt over time. And as I mentioned, some people, it might be a year before there's some kind of breakdown, burnout. Other people, it might be longer. And usually it's more unfortunate in the longer case because it creates a long-term health crisis and then lower amount of money or time is able to repair the damage that's been done, which can be really tragic.

Lenny (00:52:24):
My chat with Andy Johns is a great example of that happening.

Jonny Miller (00:52:26):
Yeah. And Andy's a superb example, and I love his vulnerability and honesty in what he's been through.

Lenny (00:52:33):
Yeah, I think if you're interested in this topic, definitely watch that episode. Another exercise that you talk a lot about is this idea, it's called NSDR, I think. Talk about that and when that might be useful, how to go about using this tool.

Jonny Miller (00:52:49):
Yeah, so NSDR was a practice coined by Andrew Huberman, who you mentioned earlier. And it basically, it's a more scientific lens on the practice of yoga nidra, which is an ancient yoga practice. But I am a huge fan of it, and I do it myself most days for 15 to 20 minutes. Basically what it looks like is you lie down, put on an eye mask or a blindfold, and you listen to a guided audio. I've recorded some myself, so I can share these in the show note links.

Lenny (00:53:16):
Your voice would be so good for these, by the way. You found your calling.

Jonny Miller (00:53:22):
Nice, yeah. It's really fun for me to do. But basically what it involves is a guided body scan. So this is also a great way to practice interoception. It's something that I didn't mention earlier was that when there's cortisol present in our body, the cortisol basically acts as a numbing agent, so it's much harder to kind of tune into those sensations. But using this, I think it's a 14-minute guided NSDR practice, you're basically lying down, there's a guided body scan, there's relaxing music in the background. And by the end of it, you feel like you've had a two-hour nap. It feels incredible.

(00:54:00):
And particularly for people who myself tend to get tired in the afternoons, if you space this out, usually between 1 and 3:00 PM for me, that will give you a second wind in the afternoon and it'll mean you won't end the day collapse on the sofa. So I think it's great for improving interoception, it's good for allowing your body to downshift and relax instead of being in that kind of high tone sympathetic state all throughout the day. So it gives your body a break, and it just feels really good. Honestly, it's probably my most played practice of everything that I teach, just people listen to it every day. So I'll share that in the show notes as well.

Lenny (00:54:41):
And I imagine if you feel like you've built this emotional debt, this would be a really good exercise to start to do, is that right?

Jonny Miller (00:54:49):
Yeah, it is fantastic. I mean, there's some people who struggle with having enough energy to kind of get out of bed and function. But again, I imagine listeners to your show, people that live in Silicon Valley, their challenge is the downshifting without external substances. And so NSDR is a really great way of strengthening that ventral vagal tone, which is our body's capacity to go from on kind of go, go, go to then relaxing. There's a quote from Kevin Kelly that I interviewed recently, and he said, "If you have a great work ethic that needs to be matched with a great rest ethic." And I think that kind of piece of actually training our capacity to downshift after stress is just completely missing from most people's playbooks.

Lenny (00:55:38):
I think with a lot of the sort of advice, if you listen, Tim Ferriss and Huberman and everyone's got this stuff you should be doing every day list and it ends up being so long and there's so many things to do, cold plunge, sauna. What is it that you practice or come back to slash what would you recommend people try to do daily that is most impactful of all this stuff we've talked about?

Jonny Miller (00:56:05):
First experiment with a bunch of different practices and see which you enjoy and notice how you feel before and then how you feel afterwards. That's kind of the key because once you know that it feels good, you're not going to have to force yourself or motivate yourself to do it. You'll just do it naturally because you know you'll feel great afterwards. I would recommend starting really simple, so starting with the 4, 4, 8 breathing or humming, doing that in the morning for just two minutes, two minutes in the beginning is enough. And I would also recommend listening to the NSDR practice at least once or twice. If you work from home, it's pretty easy after a lunch break, something like that could also be in the evening when you get home as well. Some people use it to help fall asleep.

(00:56:52):
And then the final thing that I would recommend is if you have the resources and you have access, finding a somatic practitioner or somatic therapist is so [inaudible 00:57:03]. I mean, I emerged a completely different human on the other side of the 200 breathwork journeys. I have a different experience of life basically released so much time. Even my voice sounds different. If you listen to the podcast episodes I recorded four or five years ago, my voice is higher pitched. It just sounds different. It has a different resonant quality to it.

Lenny (00:57:27):
Wow. Okay, awesome. So you've kind of summarized, I was going to try to summarize all the advice you've given, but if you were to do the bare minimum next steps based on this advice, try this 4, 4, 8/3, 3, 6/2, 2, 4. Does 2, 2, 4 work too if you just go real fast I guess?

Jonny Miller (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:57:45):
Yeah.

Jonny Miller (00:57:46):
Okay.

Lenny (00:57:46):
Okay, perfect. Okay, so do that for a couple mornings. See how that does try this NSDR practice. We'll link to a recording of how to do that and then was there something else you recommended? Oh, somatic worker, basically maybe a therapist, maybe not someone that helps you with your body.

Jonny Miller (00:58:06):
Yeah, and I'd add in the eight practice for even 15 seconds before the breathing in the morning and after, just so that you notice the difference. And if you do the NSDR, that is basically a 15-minute interoception practice as well. So you're kind of getting two birds with one stone with that practice.

Lenny (00:58:24):
What's your perspective on meditation? Does that fit into this? Do you find the NSDR replaces the need for meditation?

Jonny Miller (00:58:29):
That is a big topic. I am an avid meditator as what I've done many 10 day silent retreats. I was in a dark room for 10 days.

Lenny (00:58:40):
Wow.

Jonny Miller (00:58:41):
With meditation, I think it really depends on what you are training. It's like saying what's your opinion on exercise? Well, are you training mobility or stamina or strength? It's the same with meditation. You could be training loving kindness. You could be training your focus and attention. You could be training spacious awareness. So I'm a big fan of embodied meditation practices. So this is often the classic vipassana body scan is a good example. Again, I mean that's basically interoceptive practice where you are just moving your attention through different parts of your body over and over and over again for days on end.

(00:59:17):
In the case of vipassana retreat, meditation is helpful for the specific skill of increasing the psychological space between a stimulus and your response. So if you have some degree of meditation practice instead of getting wrapped up in a certain emotion or we're even believing a certain thought pattern, there's usually an ability to kind of step back a little bit and see if what it's, so there definitely is a place for meditation. But my viewpoint is that we've kind of over-indexed for mindfulness and meditation in over the last 20 years. There's so many apps, there's so there's much talk about it and we've completely forgotten the body-based approaches. So I'm not saying don't meditate. I think meditation for sure has its place, especially if your goal is more of the traditional waking up and seeing through the nature of the self, that's a different kind of path in my opinion. But if you're looking to function more effectively and be more in tune with your body, then there's a whole different category of practices in this bottom up variety that we've touched on today.

Lenny (01:00:27):
On the topic of bottom up, I imagine you're a big fan of this book that everyone always talks about, The Body Keeps Score, I think it's called. Would you recommend that book? Is it connected in a large part to the stuff you talk about? What do you think of that book specifically? Because I hear about it all with him.

Jonny Miller (01:00:41):
Yeah, it's a good book. It's by Bessal van der Kolk and there's another writer I think Peter Levine says, "The issues are in the tissues." Is basically the concept. And this is the idea that we have these incomplete mobilization reflexes that are stored in our body and often held as tension. It's not strictly true to say that the trauma is in the body. It is actually a cortical map in the brain which kind of tracks these things. But for kind of practical purposes, it looks and feels as if there is stored grief in my right hip or anger in my solar plexus, that's the experience that we have. And the more that you become aware of these sensations and start to develop emotional fluidity essentially, the more that tension is released and the less reactive you become and the more emotional debt you pay off. So I think The Body Keeps The Score, I think a more accurate way would be the body is the scorecard in a way. I think that's kind a slight reframe. And if you're interested in this, the work of Peter Levine, Waking the Tiger is the seminal book on this mobilization reflex stuff that I'm describing.

Lenny (01:01:51):
I never need that part of it. And basically it's actually kept in the brain, but it comes across as somewhere in the body.

Jonny Miller (01:01:57):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:01:58):
Fascinating. I want to spend a little time on a new segment that we have in this podcast that I call Contrarian Corner. So let's visit Contrarian Corner, I feel like you'll have something interesting here. So the question is there something that you have a very contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that a lot of other people really don't believe?

Jonny Miller (01:02:17):
We've already touched on I'm not a big fan of talk based meditation, which will probably get me some comments I would imagine. I'd say the other one that's worth mentioning is I think that we vastly underestimate the impact of burnout, particularly from a bottom line perspective. There was a research report that I did a couple of years ago where we interviewed these leaders and they'd all experienced burnout of some degree. And we said, if you were to estimate how much this costs your startup or business, what would you say? And the median response was a hundred thousand dollars, which I imagine is more than most people would think.

(01:02:57):
And most people aren't actively investing in burnout insurance. Like it's not something that's on many people's radar besides meditation practices and things like that. And I think part of the reason that the cost is higher is because there are these second and third order consequences of talent attrition, of opportunity costs, lost productivity, you lose great leaders, make shitty decisions in the run up to the burnout itself. There's also this idea of emotional contagion, which there's some research from Wharton I believe, and they show that the leader or the CEO has a disproportionate impact or their emotional state has a disproportionate impact on the people in their team. So something I'd like to say is the nervous system of an organization is a reflection of the nervous system of the CEO. And so I think that's just something which I would like to see talked about more.

Lenny (01:03:53):
Just on this idea of burnout, I don't think you're saying don't work really hard If you want to work really hard, it's that you need to maintain your body and mind and nervous system if you're working insanely hard. If you're working long hours, feel free, but just know there's debt you're building up and you need to be doing things to pay off that debt as you're doing that.

Jonny Miller (01:04:11):
Precisely. It is very much like building technical debt in the early days of a startup. It's worth doing, but just do it intentionally. Know that you're doing that and that. So let's say you work really hard for eight months, you give yourself a month or two off to really downshift. And it's also really worth building that nervous system capacity. It's great to be able to push it really hard and focus and then combine it with that rest ethic as well. So do NSDRs, kind of find a way to downshift so that way of working can be sustainable.

Lenny (01:04:44):
Jonny, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jonny Miller (01:04:48):
Let's do it.

Lenny (01:04:49):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jonny Miller (01:04:53):
I actually had a sense this question was coming and I have the books with me here. The first book is Constellations by David White. This is the book that I've gifted most to friends, I think more than any other book. And he basically has 52 definitions of words like ambition is I think the first word. And his writing, it just blows me away. I open this to a random page, read the definition, and it's probably affected me more than any other book. So that's one that I love. 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, which is I imagine has come up before in your podcast. This is by Jim Dethmer and Diana Chapman. They have the Conscious Leadership Group. And this is basically, in my opinion, it's the best leadership book that I've come across and it combines practicality with a lot of great theory. So this is awesome. And then finally, this is a bit out there, but Recapture the Rapture by Jamie Wheal, big fan of Jamie's work, Jamie's writing. This is kind of three books in one. The beginning is addressing the meta-crisis and a lot of the craziness that we're seeing in the world. The second chapter is very related to what we've been talking about, he calls it Hedonic Engineering and it's basically practices for shifting your state of consciousness. And the third is Ethical Cult Building, which I'll leave that there. [inaudible 01:06:22].

Lenny (01:06:22):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Jonny Miller (01:06:28):
My wife and I love animations and we saw Kubo and the Two Strings recently, which was fantastic. Just so, so great. That and also Wolf Walkers, which was an Apple TV series. Yeah, those have been my two favorite movies I've seen recently.

Lenny (01:06:46):
If you like animated content, check out the Scavengers Reign on HBO. I've mentioned it on this podcast before, but it's incredible. It's a TV show on HBO. So I usually ask, do you have a favorite question you like to ask candidates you're interviewing? But I know you coach people, so to kind of turn this question a little bit around, do you have a favorite question you like to ask executive coaching clients that you work with?

Jonny Miller (01:07:08):
I stole this question from a guy Jerry Colonna who's here in Boulder, and the question is amazing. It is so good. It's basically, how are you complicit in creating the conditions that you say you don't want? And so the word complicit there is key because it's not saying in what ways is it your fault, but it's like in what ways were you complicit in creating the conditions for anxiety, for building up emotional debt? And just the question kind of opens up the door to ways in which you are an active participant in creating these challenges in your life. And it's a really rich journal question or a question to explore with a friend, co-founder colleague.

Lenny (01:07:53):
I remember him sharing that on the Tim Ferriss podcast many years ago and it stuck with me and I often think of it, but I never am complicit of anything that goes wrong. It's never my fault. He has nothing on me. Just kidding.

Jonny Miller (01:08:06):
Excellent.

Lenny (01:08:08):
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Jonny Miller (01:08:11):
One is these blue blocking glasses. These are raw optics, blue blocker glasses. They block out a hundred percent of blue light and they are a lifesaver if I'm ever going out of the house basically after dark, I'll wear these to drive. I'll wear these to even dinners with friends sometimes. And it basically means that I'm able to then sleep well that evening. So that's one.

(01:08:38):
And then the other thing I'll briefly share, this came through the other day, you mentioned the vagus nerve earlier and that device, I have three devices here that are all vagus nerve stimulation devices. This one is called Neuro Sim. This one I believe is Pulsetto, and I think this is a Apollo Strap. I haven't used them that much yet, but they basically work by sending low level electrical stimulation directly to your vagus nerve. So this clips on your ear because the vagus nerve goes through the right side of the neck. Same with Pulsetto. And I'm really curious to compare the effect of these versus say breathwork, humming, the other body-based practices. Obviously, you can do both at the same time, but I am just interested in playing. So I wouldn't recommend them yet, but I think it's interesting that they exist.

Lenny (01:09:29):
How cool would that be? We just put these things on, we don't have to do anything else. We just get up, slap on our device and life is amazing. Don't have to meditate, don't have to breathe in a different way. I'm going to need to do this while I'm on the podcast just wear all these devices, see how that goes. Awesome. Well, I guess somehow report back to us how these go because that feels really great. Next question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends, either in work or in life?

Jonny Miller (01:10:00):
State over story would be one which we've touched on.

Lenny (01:10:02):
State over story.

Jonny Miller (01:10:04):
And then I think the other one, which I think about often is I like to say, "Make generous assumptions." And by that I mean in any situation, what is the most generous story that I can tell of this person, of this situation? Not kind of naively fabricating something, but usually there's a spectrum of I can assume that they're a bad person and they did this thing out of spite, or maybe they had a bad day, maybe they have a lot of emotional debt. There's there's many stories that can be told. And I usually try to have a practice of telling the most generous story that I can.

Lenny (01:10:47):
I like that a lot. Another way of describing that is just assume good intentions, which I often think about.

Jonny Miller (01:10:53):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:10:54):
Final question. You seem extremely calm always, and very centered and stable. What still gets you rilled up and unsettled, and what do you do when that happens?

Jonny Miller (01:11:07):
Well, I was nervous before this podcast, so I did some breathing practices and some stretching and some humming before jumping on here. I still at times notice ways in which I'm conflict avoidant. I've been working on it actively for a while, but there's a part of me that can sometimes avoid conflict. And so I've actually noticed how there's a relationship between that and having a healthy relationship to anger. So basically giving myself permission to express frustration, not at someone, but just allow it to be there. And then from that place set better boundaries with my time with what I'm doing, saying no to certain things. I think that's the practice that's most alive for me right now.

Lenny (01:11:53):
Jonny, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online and explore the things that you offer? I think you teach a course, whatever else you offer, talk about that and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonny Miller (01:12:06):
Yeah, well, this has been so much fun. I am very active on Twitter or X. My handle is Jonny Miller. It's J-O-N-N-Y-M-1-L-L-E-R. And yeah, if this was interesting or listeners would like to dive deeper, I teach a course. Our next cohort is running in the spring, the end of March. Applications are now open, and the website is nsmastery.com/lenny. I've created a custom page and there's a $250 juicy discount for listeners if they want to sign up.

Lenny (01:12:39):
I got to sign up for this myself. I didn't know you're going to do that. That's awesome. And NS Mastery stands for Nervous System Mastery.

Jonny Miller (01:12:47):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:12:48):
Amazing. Anything else? And then the second question of how listeners can be useful to you.

Jonny Miller (01:12:52):
Well, firstly, if any of this resonates, I'd love to hear from you on Twitter or email me as well. I can pass over my email and I would just love it if you experiment with this stuff. I love this idea of just being a scientist of life. So if anything that we've talked about resonates or any of the practices you want to try, just go out and try it and see how it feels and then tell me about it. That would be the greatest gift I think.

Lenny (01:13:23):
And the best way to tell you about it is tweet at you or is there something else?

Jonny Miller (01:13:26):
Tweet at me or my email is jonny@curioushumans.com. So feel free to email me as well.

Lenny (01:13:32):
All right, I'm going to use all these things. Jonny, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. I am excited for the show notes we're going to have to give people actual tools to use to become less anxious and nervous in their work and life. Thank you again for being here.

Jonny Miller (01:13:46):
Amazing. Thanks so much, Lenny. This was super fun.

Lenny (01:13:48):
Same for me. Bye everyone.

# The UX Research reckoning is here | Judd Antin (Airbnb, Meta)

## Transcript

Judd Antin (00:00:00):
User-centered performance refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. It's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. If your listeners are like, "I don't do that." I'm like, "Think about it for a second. This is extremely common." Every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, "Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions," that's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. One of my big mantras was, "We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong." Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance.

Lenny (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Judd Anton. Judd helped build the user research practice at Facebook. He was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, and his direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, Fair, and other amazing companies. These days, Judd spends his time consulting, helping companies with organizational challenges, product strategy, design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management. In our conversation, we unpack a conclusion that Jud has come to recently about how the user research field is going through a reckoning and what needs to change both within the user research field and how companies leverage user research going forward. 

(00:01:37):
Judd shares what the user research field has gotten wrong over the last decade, how PMs and designers rely on user research too often, and to answer the wrong questions, where user research will continue to provide significant value, and how to best leverage your researchers, why it's important for researchers to think about the business goals more versus just what the users need, what to look for when you're hiring a user researcher, how PMs can be better partners to researchers, and also a phenomenon that I love that Judd describes and often witnesses, that he calls user-centered performance, where everyone acts like they care about the user, but they're just doing it for show and already know what they want to do. This episode has a lot of spicy takes and will probably upset some people, but Judd is sharing some real talk, here, that I think we all need to hear. With that, I bring you Judd Antin after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:02:27):

Judd Antin (00:04:22):
Lenny, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:24):
It's my pleasure. So we actually worked together at Airbnb for many years. And as I was preparing for this, I realized how many of the people that you managed went on to do amazing things. So I'm just going to read a list of people that worked for you and what they do now. We had Matt Gallivan, who now leads research at Slack. We have Janna Bray, who leads research at Notion, Celeste Ridlen, who leads research at Robinhood. Rebecca Grey, who leads research at Fair, Hannah Pileggi, who I think was leading research at Duolingo, Louise Beryl, who leads research at Figma, and then Noam, who was leading research at Wealthfront. I think he moved on to something else. What a fricking crazy alumni community and group from this one team that you hired and incubated.

Judd Antin (00:05:11):
No, I've never looked at that list, but I'll tell you, I have been so privileged to work with all these amazing humans. I can't take credit for it. They're just outstanding people. And I'm glad the diaspora is out there, because these people, rock stars.

Lenny (00:05:23):
Okay. The main reason that I wanted to do a podcast episode with you is that you wrote this piece that was titled The User Research Reckoning is Here, which I understand caused quite a stir in the research community and I think adjacent communities. And let me just read one of your takeaways at the top of your post to give people a sense of what it was about. You wrote, "The user research discipline over the last 15 years is dying. The reckoning is here. The discipline can still survive and thrive, but we'd better adapt, and quick." Before we get into the meat of the piece, could you share a bit about just the reaction to this piece and maybe if it was a surprise and what you expected would happen when you put this out?

Judd Antin (00:06:06):
Yeah, I was definitely surprised. I wrote it because I wanted to start a conversation about something I was thinking about. I didn't really know who would read it. And in the end it turned out a lot of people read it. I learned that using the word reckoning may have been a mistake because it inspires a lot of drama in a conversation that I wanted to be really productive and positive. Overall, I would say, though, that the response was very positive. It seemed to resonate with a lot of people who reached out to me. I spent a lot of time talking to teams, to designers, to researchers, but there were also a ton of critiques. 

(00:06:43):
I would say some of it was like people thought I was throwing research or researchers under the bus, like, "It's researchers' fault. We're doing it wrong." Which I don't believe at all. And that I wasn't taking responsibility as a research leader or a design leader myself. And the most interesting one I would say was the anti-capitalist crew, because one of my points that we'll talk about is that I think researchers need to be more profit focused. And there are a lot of people out there who, I think they think that's not cool or not research's job, and I'm like, "Well, what are we doing then, if we're not helping businesses succeed?" But that was the most surprising critique, for sure.

Lenny (00:07:23):
I've worked with some of those people who are just like, "Why are we growing? Why do we focus so much on growth? Why do we need to grow this business?"

Judd Antin (00:07:29):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:07:29):
So I get that. 

Judd Antin (00:07:30):
Maybe it's the wrong industry for them.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Yeah. I'm not a fan of that. Okay. Let's actually dig into the meat of your message, and the big takeaway, and the conclusion of what you're finding is happening in user research. And I know a lot of this comes from a lot of user researchers have been laid off at a lot of companies. It was one of the hardest hit teams. And so I think a lot of this comes from that. So yeah, so let's just start big and then see where it goes.

Judd Antin (00:07:53):
So yeah, everybody who's paying attention has noticed that there have been a bunch of layoffs. And I think back in the summer I was thinking, "Listen, this seems to be hitting UX and UX research particularly hard. Is there something going on? Is there a bigger picture?" The reason I use the word reckoning is because to me that's like, "Hey, a moment to take stock." And triggered by the fact that a lot of wonderful humans may have lost their jobs, and many more are afraid of losing their jobs. And so if it's a sign, the fact that research has been hit so hard, it's a sign of what? And so the thesis of my article is really, it's a sign that maybe the system is a little more broken than we think and that research is not driving the value or impact that it should or could. And that's for a bunch of reasons, I think. Some of it is stuff that research can do better, and a lot of it is how research is integrated and positioned in companies. 

(00:08:46):
And at the root of all that, I think, is that we're just doing too much of what I would consider the wrong type of research. And what I mean by the wrong type of research is I have this framework, and it's in the article, macro, middle range, and micro research, at least three ways to talk about it. And it's pretty simple, the intuition of what those are. So macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next, stuff like that. 

(00:09:20):
And then you have micro research, which a lot of really technical usability falls into this, all the beautiful stuff that researchers do to enable a really high quality, excellent, pixel perfect thing to go out the door, laser-focused research to understand AB test results, stuff like that. And then you have this middle range, which is this blobular place where the research questions are middle altitude and a lot of the core, let's say user understanding questions fall here. And a lot of what research is doing is research in that space. It's, "Let's take a group of people and ask some questions about how they think, feel, behave, how they're using a product or not using a product." And it's just this devastating mix of really interesting to many, including researchers, and not impactful enough for the business. That's the core thesis. Researchers do it because it's interesting, but honestly, and a thing we should talk about, Lenny, is researchers also do it because it's the kind of work we most often get asked to do. 

Lenny (00:10:22):
Yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. As a PM, that's what I want to get answers to, is like, "How should we think about this one product?" And I totally get this.

Judd Antin (00:10:31):
Yeah. The questions turn out to be really interesting and there are many cases at many companies where it's super impactful. But the problem with those types of questions is they tend to, they trigger all the worst stuff that researchers experience. So they yield results which are interesting, but sometimes hard to operationalize. They trigger the post hoc bias, really, really, really well where a lot of people can say confidently like, "Oh, that was obvious. We knew that already." And they fulfill this need for us to feel and be customer obsessed, user-centered, without changing anything. So doing too much of that research to me is a symptom of a broken system, and where companies are really different from each other. I heard from so many after this article and they're like, "Well, my company and my industry is like this or not like this." 

(00:11:24):
But in tech, we spent the last many years hiring, hiring, hiring researchers, but maybe, I'm sure most of your listeners are familiar with the idea of a ZIRP. Maybe it was a zero interest base phenomenon, where it was okay when the money was easy, to hire researchers, even though we were not setting them up properly. We're were going to set them up to fail. We set them up as a service function. We didn't know what research was for. We didn't know how to really drive impact with it. And that's where the reckoning comes from. It's like that era is over. Research, I think, is more crucial than ever. Good, great researchers are more impactful than ever. But it's in a new space. We're in a new space now.

Lenny (00:12:05):
I want to make sure people understand this framework. And specifically, how would you best describe the difference between this middle range research and macro research?

Judd Antin (00:12:16):
Middle range research is usually focused on a more specific set of research questions or a constituency. So if macro is like, "Let's understand the overall competitive landscape. Let's do a concept car type project where we really look ahead. Let's get involved with strategic planning," which is a wonderful thing for researchers to do, do TAM studies, other things like that, that stuff lives in the macro space. 

(00:12:42):
The middle range space is like, what's a good example? "We want to know how Airbnb hosts feel about their payment options." That's a really interesting, reasonable question. And we can go out and do research on that, but it's not that specific. It's not really targeted at a business problem yet. It could be. Maybe that's a result of the research, but it yields these middle range insights in which we've learned things like, "Well, hosts want flexibility about their payment options." I'm making this up. And that's a good example where it's like, "It's not that that's not an interesting set of questions, it's just not quite pointed enough." And it's not framed in the language of the funnel, or the business strategy, or the OKRs. It's not quite enough aligned enough to that. It's too blobular in that middle level and it ends up not driving impact.

Lenny (00:13:38):
I think it also leads to a lot of the things as you described, people don't like about research. It delays everything. You have to wait for the research to be done to have an answer, to make a clear decision. It also creates this issue that people complain about, that PMs and product teams don't want to just make a decision on their own. They're like, "I will get this additional data point and make sure research tells us this is the right answer instead of just trusting there." God, I guess maybe along those lines, this might be going off a little track, but what's your advice there for, say, product managers or PMs or product teams to not necessarily rely on research for that middle research?

Judd Antin (00:14:14):
I think the reason why so many PMs ask for those middle range questions is because they haven't really gotten deep with their researcher in a way which can leverage it for maximum impact. So if the question is like, "Hey, Judd, you just pointed out a bunch of problems, can you be more solutions oriented?" Well, the solution is simple but not easy to me. It's that we need to restructure the way we make products in a way which integrates research much more fully. It looks like consistent relationships in which researchers, and the work, and the insights they provide are a part of the process from beginning to end.

(00:14:51):
And I think, Lenny, you as a PM, that's how you worked. I remember you, I know who you worked with. You worked with great researchers. But honestly, most product processes are not that way. And so that's when research is a service function. It gets called in right at the end. It's reactive in the sense that a researcher in the room listening and participating in the conversation could have a ton of impact on framing exactly the right question that will drive maximum business impact, maximum product improvement at that moment, and then go do it quick, and get back, and we're onto the next. But they weren't there, the relationship wasn't there. They're not engaged in the project from the beginning. And that's the number one root of the problem. As long as research is a service discipline, I think we're going to be stuck in this spot.

Lenny (00:15:37):
When people might be hearing this, on the one hand, it's research has been not as helpful to teams as they thought, and researchers have been spending time on the wrong thing. On the other hand, your advice is integrate research from the beginning, make them more involved throughout. And I think that might confuse people. How should people think about, like, "Research is actually more important? You should integrate them more deeply."

Judd Antin (00:15:59):
There's a vicious cycle that's been happening, is from where I sit, and this is what I hear from many, many researchers and research leaders, which is a lot of companies hired a lot of researchers with great intentions, didn't quite know how to integrate them. And UX research is a newer discipline, so maybe that's not surprising. We're still learning how to use it. "Cool, let's evolve." But a lot of companies hired these people, but they hired them into kind of like a service discipline, very reactive, not in the room, not integrated in the way I said. 

(00:16:30):
And so they had less input on the questions to ask, or they're included, but only at the end. And then they're unable to build those direct relationships, to be there in the room to actually drive the questions and insert insights. Because a good researcher is like the repository of insights you need for growth, but they're not there. They don't participate in the decision. So they end up doing research. They have jobs to do, so they do research that is too reactive, it doesn't matter, and then it's less impactful. Executives conclude that therefore researchers are not as impactful and then they get sidelined or laid off and the cycle continues. 

(00:17:07):
So I think the short circuit is the constant engagement. If you take a great researcher and you insert them consistently in a product process, I feel confident that researcher will drive a product improvement, metrics impact, growth, all the things that you want to see as a PM and a product leader. It's just that's the exception, not the norm these days.

Lenny (00:17:31):
This may be a hard question to answer, but when people hear, "If you have a great researcher, here's how you approach it." What are signals that your researchers is great versus not great? What are some things people could look for to tell them, like, "Oh, maybe I have the wrong researcher on my team."

Judd Antin (00:17:44):
The best researchers I think are first of all, multi method. The first iteration of user research was primarily a qualitative discipline. But a strong opinion that I have is that is largely one of those models that needs to evolve. It's not that qualitative user research is no longer important. It's that the best researchers have five tools. I think they have five tools. And those five tools are number one, what we would call formative or generative user experience research. So looking ahead, innovation focused, really open-ended, maybe more ethnographic, "Let's go out into the field and talk to host and guests on Airbnb. Let's see people using our product in the field," stuff like that. So that's formative. 

(00:18:27):
The second type is evaluative, so more like usability testing. The third tool is a basic rigorous survey design. It's the best scaled way to get responses from communities small and large. You can get a lot out of really well crafted surveys. But to do that, you have to have the fourth tool, which is applied statistics, the best research, know a little bit of stats. You can't interact in a world of AB testing without knowing basic statistics. 

(00:18:56):
And then in the old version of this, the fifth tool was SQL, because I think good researchers need to be able to run their own queries. These days, so much of that is dashboarded, that the fifth tool may now be prompt engineering, which is a thing we could talk about, but I think maybe that's the fifth tool is somewhere, is it technical skills that fall in between querying your own data, understanding it very well in companies that are awash with data and then interacting with generative AI.

Lenny (00:19:24):
Amazing. That's such a cool list. Okay, so just to playback, formative, generative, innovative skills to think bigger and come up with new ideas, usability.

Judd Antin (00:19:35):
Yep.

Lenny (00:19:35):
Yeah, usability. How did you describe it? I have a different word, here. Evaluate? Evaluative?

Judd Antin (00:19:41):
Evaluative, right.

Lenny (00:19:41):
Okay.

Judd Antin (00:19:41):
So we're evaluating products and doing more. Really that's the micro level of research. 

Lenny (00:19:47):
Survey design, being really rigorous about it, applied statistics, and then SQL/dashboard/prompt engineering. 

Judd Antin (00:19:53):
Right. 

Lenny (00:19:54):
Maybe just one last question along this thread, also a big question, but any advice for how to evaluate these skills/interview for them? I know this is its own deep topic, but any advice for someone trying to find this person?

Judd Antin (00:20:05):
I've interviewed hundreds or thousands of researchers, and the way I usually approach that is you want a researcher who's got a Swiss army knife, because if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. And so if you give in the context of an interview, let's say, a researcher, a pretty juicy, open-ended research question, and you want to see how they handle it, and a good answer is usually multi-method. We're not going to handle it in any one way. We're going to say, "Well, here's a couple of ways we could deal with this. Here's how we could do this in a day, or a week, or a month." We usually don't have a month, but sometimes big research projects go on for that long. "And here are the different sets of methods that we can use." 

(00:20:44):
So see where they go. It's actually pretty simple. Most researchers are deeper in one than the other, and sometimes you can make up for those five tools with the team. So you have experts who are t-shaped, but maybe deeper in one or several of those ways. But when I built a team at Meta and at Airbnb, that was my goal, is individually as researchers build up those tools and then as a team build deep expertise that would fill all the gaps.

Lenny (00:21:10):
Coming back to the main premise of your post, one of your big takeaways is, "Researchers need to be much more business oriented, thinking about what helps the business versus the user." Which I think to a lot of researchers will feel really weird. Can you just talk about your takeaways there?

Judd Antin (00:21:25):
So much of user experience practice, not just research, but design too, is focused on empathy and very user-centered. This is beautiful. I'm not saying that we should abandon that. I think what I'm saying is there's an overlapping event, where you have the user and profit or the business. And what researchers need to do is be way more explicit about finding that overlap. So one thing, when researchers ask for advice, they're like, "Well, what should I do to be more business or profit focused?" I say something like, "Did you read the last quarterly report, If it's a public company? Did you listen to the shareholder call?" And they're probably like, "No, it's full of a bunch of language I didn't quite get." 

(00:22:12):
And I'm like, "Yep." So there you go. That's the language you need to learn. Scour your Google Drive folder, your internal folder and look for all of the documents that are about this quarter, or this halves, or next half strategy. What are the OKRs? Understand the metrics and the conversion funnel, know it back and forward, because then what you're doing is you're proposing, if you're in the active conversation, you're saying, 'Cool, I hear you asking that research question. I've identified this is exactly the spot in the funnel where I think we need to do work. There's an opportunity here. Or that competitor is eating our lunch with this group of users. I know that because I read the competitive report and I understand it deeply.'" So those are skills that some researchers have and a lot are building these days, but historically, last 15 years, it hasn't been a thing we've been as focused on, and I think that's an evolution that needs to happen.

Lenny (00:23:06):
I think a lot of PMs listening to this are going to be like, "Hallelujah." This is exactly what I've been trying to convince people of. It's what I've been trying to convince my researchers of, and design often falls into this.

Judd Antin (00:23:17):
But Lenny, the opposite is true, too, because you got to take the average PM who lives in that land, all day, every day, and what they do is not in the Venn. I think those are people who are also performing customer centricity and performing user-centeredness a lot, when they're really not interested. And so this is not about researcher. This takes two sides. Fixing this broken system takes everyone, researchers, PMs, designers, everyone at a company, but also the way that organization is structured, and integrating itself in a different way. Everybody's got to come to the table.

Lenny (00:23:55):
Such a good point. And you have this actual term that you call user-centered performance, where it's the performance of being user-centered. Can you talk about that and then just what advice you'd give to PMs that, hearing this, are like, "Yes, I love everything you're saying," and then not realizing maybe they're too far in that extreme?

Judd Antin (00:24:11):
User-centered performance is a term I made up, because it's fun to make up terms. And it refers to customer obsession or a user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. So it's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. And if your listeners are like, "I don't do that." I'm like, "Think about it for a second." Because this is extremely common. It shows up in explicit ways and implicit ways. 

(00:24:52):
So explicitly, I would say every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, "Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions?" That's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. That PM is not interested in being wrong at all. It's too late in the game for that. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. So any check the box style research is a wild example of user-centered performance. 

(00:25:22):
I would argue every researcher has probably had to do executive listening sessions because a lot of PMs, founders, product people, but designers, too, they want to get close to the customer. And so, like, "Can I do some focus groups? I want to be there. I want to ask them questions." This is 97% performance. It's well-intentioned, but it isn't focused on learning. It isn't going to drive better outcomes or more impact. 

(00:25:49):
And then there's all these implicit ways that people engage in that kind of user performance, too. A lot of it comes down to cognitive biases, confirmation bias, ego. One of my big mantras was, "We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong." That is the mindset you should use when you're approaching insights and research. "I want to be wrong. I want you to do research that shows we were off base in the following ways. Tell me exactly how and why in a way that allows me to fix it quickly." But many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate. And that's user-centered performance.

Lenny (00:26:29):
Oh, man. I think a lot of people are hearing this and feeling exposed.

Judd Antin (00:26:33):
Exposed.

Lenny (00:26:35):
I feel like you're like this Deep Throat person coming from sharing these things people don't want to talk about at the office.

Judd Antin (00:26:35):
I know.

Lenny (00:26:42):
There's this quote in your post I'm going to read. "Product managers love to ask for middle range research that they can use to justify decisions they're reluctant to make on their own. User designers love to ask for middle range research because it fits their model of what proper design process should look like. Executives love to ask for middle range because they don't really understand what research is for, and helps them do performative user-centeredness. In the end, they will decide based on their own opinions."

Judd Antin (00:27:07):
There is an important place for intuition in product development, of course. The best designers, researchers, product people develop strong intuition for the product. But you got to understand, intuition is where all of those biases lie. It's where all your blind spots are. And what great insights people do, what great researchers do when you're next to them all the time, is they'll expose you. I don't have to be the Deep Throat, because you have somebody who's professional job is ... Keeping you honest is probably the wrong way to put it, but as somebody whose capabilities are about expanding your horizons, making it so that your intuition is constantly improving, you don't have to rely on it when your intuition and the evidence sort of collide in a way that either affirms or falsifies the product decision you made. Now something really good is happening. 

(00:28:00):
And the other thing that is inherent in that quote is I, at Airbnb, wore many hats over the years. I was head of research two different times. I was head of design for guest products. And my last job was I was head of the design studio, so UX research, UX design, writing, localization, they all reported up to me. So I've seen this from many disciplinary angles in the UX field. And researchers aren't the only ones who are guilty of this. I would say design has a ton of performance. And it comes from the fact that we have figured out user-centered design, this process, or design thinking, which IDEO popularized. Like, "That's what we're supposed to do, right? Bezos told us that we, as PMs, had to be customer obsessed. So that's what we're supposed to do."

(00:28:48):
It's a really common and damaging thing when we don't genuinely have that growth learning mindset, and it's easy to sideline researchers. We don't need them in that situation. We've got our guts. Isn't the gut where a great PM, a great founder needs to have that gut? And they do, but they need to be open to the fact that your gut, is limited, and biased, and narrow, and wrong sometimes.

Lenny (00:29:13):
The two sides of this is trust your gut opinion, "I don't need research, I don't need data. I have opinions, and my own experience, and I'm going to use the product, and let's just go with what feels right to me." Versus pure data-driven research driven for designers that are maybe listening for product managers. Do you have any advice for just where to fall on that spectrum and just how to best leverage research to inform that opinion?

Judd Antin (00:29:36):
Yeah, I taught a class at UC Berkeley this semester on leadership, and we talk about that a lot, because great leaders develop intuition. It's the pattern matching part of experience, where you develop heuristics which allow you to make good judgments even if you can't quite explain where that judgment came from. That's what the gut is. But it's also, like I said, where bias comes from, where all the cognitive biases, there's a list of 151 of them on Wikipedia, I won't name them, but all those thorny things that lead us astray, the behavioral economists and social psychologists study, those live in the gut. And so the advice is when you are looking to check your gut, you have to do that thing. A lot of your listeners have probably read Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1, System 2. Right? 

Lenny (00:30:29):
I have it here, right under my laptop, actually, holding up my laptop screen. 

Judd Antin (00:30:32):
That's so appropriate, Lenny. So the secret is not that sexy. It's System 2. So you engage that slow, methodical process in which you do analytic thinking as a means of checking your gut. Slow in the grand scheme of things. Slow meaning not a split second decision, not like months of analysis. That's not what I mean. 

(00:30:54):
The other thing you can do, and there's really great research on this, is you bring in the wisdom of the crowd. So the wisdom of the crowd is a phrase a lot of people are familiar with, and it works in a specific situation. The wisdom of the crowd works when the people involved with the decision are bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table. Obviously, if everybody has the same sources of information, then it doesn't matter how many people are out there. So if you want to check your gut, get a bunch of different guts together, get a bunch of different people in the room who can bring evidence and intuition to bear, and have an open, direct end kind conversation in which we might disagree. You know who's great at that? Researchers

Lenny (00:31:38):
Leading those discussions essentially, and getting a bunch of people's opinions.

Judd Antin (00:31:41):
Yeah, this is the structural solution I'm talking about, Lenny, is like, "I never asked for research teams to have their own separate OKRs." I said two things, "Number one, what's the teams? Shouldn't the PMs, the engineers, the designers and the research, everybody should have the same set of metrics for success because either we're doing it together or we're not." And then I said, "My metric for success is when they won't have that meeting without you." That's my metric for success. If they cannot have that decision making meeting without the researcher there, that means you've developed influence, strong, trusting relationships, you're an active participant in the process, not just somebody who provides input into someone else's process. And that is when researchers can have huge impact.

Lenny (00:32:29):
I think of the PM role in a similar way, even though people won't have these meetings with PMs, because they're often at the center of lot of the stuff, but you want to be a PM that people want on their team. There's a lot of teams that are like, "We don't want and PMs, we don't need product managers. They just get in the way." And I find that that's only the case when the product manager's not great, and not really good at their job, because most great PMs just make everyone's life easier.

Judd Antin (00:32:50):
They do. The grease, I-

Lenny (00:32:51):
The grease.

Judd Antin (00:32:53):
... love it.

Lenny (00:32:54):
You mentioned also, before we started recording, that the biggest challenge for user researchers is in their relationship with their product manager. Can you speak to that and what you've seen there?

Judd Antin (00:33:04):
I'm wary of overgeneralizing, but I can tell you that from my experience and from what I hear, the product research or product insights relationship is one of the most challenged. And I think it comes from the fact that fundamentally, many researchers are just not included in the process that PMs are running. And then, actually, I did some asking around before this podcast, and so I thought, "There are some tropes that researchers have about PMs that are worth PMs knowing, just like four or five of them, the things that researchers know PMs say, which drive us nuts because they're not true." 

(00:33:51):
So the first one is that research just slows us down. Research is too slow. This is bullshit. A great research team can do research in a day, a week, or a month. It just depends on what you want to get out of it, like, "How much detail do you need? How many people do we need to talk to? What is the depth or breadth? Do we need to go to seven different countries to talk about our constituencies in Latin America?" Well, that's not going to happen overnight, but we don't often need that. The other way to look at that is that is it slower to get it wrong and fix it than to take a hot second to do the work to get it right the first time? So that's BS. Good research doesn't slow us down, it speeds us up.

Lenny (00:34:36):
And also just along those lines, a big part of your premise is you don't need to do as much research as people are doing, like this middle research that a lot of the time is put into. 

Judd Antin (00:34:45):
Yeah. Research can go super fast. I think especially, so the macro level research, I hope what it is tied to things like annual planning processes. We did a thing at Airbnb several years that we called, it was like Insights 2019, Insights 2020. They were concept car projects. And we spent quite a long time synthesizing the entire year's worth of insights from every place we could get them and then developing with designers and engineers like a concept car for five years in the future. So that's a long process. 

(00:35:16):
But the micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there, so much business value, and it can go so fast, Lenny, it can go so fast. You can have results in 48 hours on these things. We did a thing at Airbnb. There's a famous story which I'll only tell in the abstract, because I don't want to out anything, but we call it the multimillion dollar button. And basically we did research which revealed that people weren't going down the purchase funnel because they were afraid. The calls to actions on the button was making them afraid that it would initiate a purchase when really it was just taking the next step. 

(00:35:58):
We changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design, our UX writing team. We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, "Hey, this button feels scary. The CTA on the button feels scary." So that's a great example of how micro ... And that happened in like 48 hours, we would discover that insight, or overnight, basically. And we were like, "Hm, maybe we should test some other CTAs." We did the conversion, we added like 1%, which is really, really hard to do. So that's a quick example of how that type of quick research can drive a huge amount of business value.

Lenny (00:36:39):
This episode is brought to you by Ahrefs. Many of you already know Ahrefs as one of the top tools for search engine optimization. It's used by thousands of SEOs and companies like IBM, Adidas and eBay. What you may not know is that there's a free version that was made with small website owners in mind. It's called Ahrefs Webmaster Tools. It's free and it can help you bring more traffic to your website. Ahrefs Webmaster Tools will show you keywords that you rank for and backlinks that you can get. It also performs automated site audits to find what issues prevent your website from ranking higher on Google. Every detected issue comes with a detailed explanation and advice on how to fix it.

(00:37:29):
So just to make this even clearer, I think this middle research zone is the stuff that does slow people down, I imagine. It's like, "What are the challenges hosts have with payments on Airbnb?" What you're basically saying is, "Spend your time doing the micro stuff like usability research and then the bigger stuff that's part of overall planning. That's part of the planning cycle. It's not like every project you're working on, you need to have a whole research project on."

Judd Antin (00:37:55):
Exactly. The micro research should be much more common. A lot of researchers think that that's scut work, that usability is something junior researchers do. I completely disagree. I think we need to get back there as an industry and be like, "When you make a product easier to use, when you discover problems with functionality, business metrics we care about will go up." I've seen it happen. But that's not just work for interns and new grads, that's for sure. 

(00:38:24):
And then the planning process, absolutely. If we're integrated from beginning to end, we can help. And the thing about that middle range, I think you're right. That's the stuff that makes the stereotype that research is slow, and a lot of times it's also because it's just not pointed enough. The researcher can also say in that moment, "I have studied the business plan. I know exactly where, I've seen the metrics trend, I have an idea about exactly where that's going to go." We still need to do that middle range research. The question is valuable, but it's now very pointed and the time is worth it.

Lenny (00:38:58):
Amazing. Okay, I want to cure the rest of these tropes.

Judd Antin (00:39:01):
Okay, research is too slow is the first one. The second one, I can do my own research. Why do I need researchers? And that's true, as product people, I hope you are engaging with customers and listening well. But no offense, garbage in, garbage out. The thing is, anyone can talk to a user. That does not constitute research or insights work because one user can be powerful, but one user can be idiosyncratic. And a researcher knows how to get to the heart of that really quick. They know how to take that conversation, and understand, and situate it in a way which means like, "Sure, democratize research. That's happening. There are tools out there that will let anybody get customer feedback, voice a customer type stuff." But a researcher is there to help you turn garbage into something that's not garbage and avoid the bias that can come from you just reaching out to your cousin's family and then doing whatever they thought you should do to the product. So that's the second trope. 

(00:40:08):
The third one is AB test everything. And AB tests are great, but one of my most painful things to do is to sit in a room full of PMs and data scientists who have just seen the results of an experiment that flipped a stat sig, and then they're like, "Cool, I was significantly down over this course of time for these users." And then they just start speculating about why that is, because the AB test rarely tells you why it changed in the way it did. And then this endless flywheel of AB testing goes and I'm like, "Hey, you don't have to guess. I know somebody who can get you an answer or at least evidence that addresses the question of why did we see the test result we did in a very short amount of time? Or you could use your customers as Guinea pigs, and throw more experiments at them over and over, and spend a long time on it, and come to the same place in the end."

Lenny (00:41:03):
I think a similar critique that PMs often have is AB testing is conclusive scientifically, statistically, user research is just talking to a bunch of people. Why would I trust that? What is your best way to help PMs realize that this is actually very valuable data and you should listen to it? It's not just, you know, a story here and there. 

Judd Antin (00:41:26):
Yeah. No, I think they're both right. AB testing is as close as we can get to making causal claims about products. Research is usually not oriented towards making causal claims or it should not be, but those causal claims rarely tell you how and why things happen. And if you want to not make that mistake again in the future, you need to know how and why. If you want to build a better product in a way that doesn't just answer this narrow question that an AB test answered, you need to know how and why. And so you need both. Beautiful partnerships between data scientists and research and insights people are, I think what we're going to see in that next evolution. And if you set that virtuous cycle up, if you set up the engagement where those people are involved from the beginning, you don't make those mistakes. You get the causal relationship, which is valuable for one reason and the hows and whys, which are valuable for other reasons. 

Lenny (00:42:19):
Awesome. Okay. I think there's two more tropes you had. 

Judd Antin (00:42:23):
One of them is a simple one, which is like everyone loves to quote that it turns out a totally apocryphal Henry Ford quote about, "If I'd asked my users." It turns out to the best of our knowledge, he did not say that. And-

Lenny (00:42:35):
Really? What?

Judd Antin (00:42:36):
Yeah, I know. Isn't that sad? 

Lenny (00:42:36):
I didn't know that.

Judd Antin (00:42:38):
I know. Sorry to burst your bubble, Lenny. 

Lenny (00:42:40):
Oh, wow. 

Judd Antin (00:42:41):
Who was-

Lenny (00:42:41):
Does anyone say anything? I feel like every quote is-

Judd Antin (00:42:44):
Is apocryphal, now? I know. 

Lenny (00:42:46):
Yeah. What is reality? Geez, can we? Well, let's just- 

Judd Antin (00:42:49):
Okay, maybe he said that. He certainly believed that. That's what the historians say. But the reason that makes researchers so angry is because that's not research. That's not what researchers do. A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher. I've never done that in my career. No one on my team has ever run a study that's like that. So that just makes researchers mad.

(00:43:16):
And then the last one is about post-hoc bias. It's, "We knew this already. That was obvious." And I think a lot about this book, which I would recommend to your listeners. The author is a sociologist at UPenn named Duncan Watts, and the title is Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer. And it's about hindsight bias. He makes the argument that we rely too much on intuition, heuristics, and pattern matching in a way that is inappropriate to our experience. And it's like it leads us astray. It's like a form of self gaslighting. And it happens because we end up selectively remembering things and then constructing narratives around them in a way which makes us feel like we already knew that, when we in fact did not.

(00:44:05):
And he talks about this other, one of those cognitive biases called the narrative fallacy, which is the idea that people love to make convenient, simple stories about the past. If I asked you about your career, Lenny, and how you got to be this amazing podcast host, you'd be like, "Well, let me tell you about this series of events." And we do that. It's part of how we make sense of our lives and the information around us, but it would probably be a lie in the sense that we all twist the evidence we have to fit the narrative we want to be true, because it's simple, and lovely, and makes us happy.

Lenny (00:44:36):
This is going to sound self-serving, but I find I'm the opposite. I'm like, "I have no idea how this all came about. Here's some things that happened, and somehow I ended up here." But maybe I'm being very modest and try to not give myself any credit.

Judd Antin (00:44:49):
That's beautiful.

Lenny (00:44:50):
Thank you for these tropes, by the way. This was fun. I didn't know you were going to do that. So that's a fun, little collection we've got, here. 

Judd Antin (00:44:54):
Thanks.

Lenny (00:44:56):
I wanted to ask about, there's this tweet by Patrick Collison that I've brought up a couple of times on this podcast, that I think is really interesting. And his tweet is this, "In my opinion, the best product will stem from a very strong mental model of the domain and user. User research can help you get such a model and validate it along the way. But it's important to view the syllogism of UXR as model of user research, to improving your mental model of the user, to what product you should build versus user research tells you what product to build." Does that resonate in any way thoughts on that way of thinking about user research?

Judd Antin (00:45:34):
Yeah, there's a double-edged sword we talk about a lot in the research community, which is about making recommendations for design. So the best research doesn't leave it at that. It tells you, and it's like the what, the so what, and then the then what. But the problem with that is some researchers go too far in the other direction, where they're like, "We ran this study, it yielded these insights, and therefore this is what we should build." And everyone else on the team is like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Glad to hear your thoughts on the matter, but there's a lot going on here. Maybe we should talk about it." And that makes perfect sense. That's a failure of communication. 

(00:46:19):
And I think that speaks to the thing that Patrick is saying, is like, "Good research can sometimes tell us exactly what the problem is and exactly how to fix it." An example of that is the multimillion dollar button I told you about. But in a lot of the bigger picture questions, especially the macro ones and maybe also the really pointed middle range ones, the point isn't really, "This is exactly what we should do and this is exactly what we should build." It is, "Let us develop a framework which is based on actual evidence, and then together as a team figure out how we want to experiment our way to a successful product."

Lenny (00:46:53):
To close the loop on this specific thread, what is your advice to teams, researchers to help move out of this reckoning, and to move forward, and help the field, both from a user researcher perspective and also from just a company that maybe laid off a bunch of user researchers or is trying to decide what to do with their researchers?

Judd Antin (00:47:14):
Thank you for asking. I think I said to you earlier, and I feel some pressure as maybe the first conversation that you've had specifically about research on this podcast.

Lenny (00:47:23):
Yeah, I think so. 

Judd Antin (00:47:25):
And I want to help. I believe so much in this discipline of research and insights, and I think when I said, "The UX research discipline of the last 15 years is dying," I didn't mean that I think research is dying, far from it. I think that there's a version of it, which we're now moving past and into a new version. We're going through an evolution, as many do. And so the question for me is like, "How can researchers, and the companies, and the other people with whom they work create a new version, a different version, an evolution, which is hugely impactful for the business?" 

(00:47:57):
And so the advice I'd give to researchers about that is develop diverse research skills. Remembering the five or five and a half tool list that I mentioned earlier, really go deep on that business knowledge, so speaking the language of product, and business, and metrics, and understanding exactly how to use your insights like a scalpel, building those strong relationships, which is not a thing that researchers can do by themselves. It requires two-way engagements, and also in a way which allows researchers to do fewer things better. 

(00:48:30):
So most researchers that I know are working on teams where they're like, "I'm the only researcher, and I have seven PMs and 20 designers, and I'm trying to do 10 projects." And no one's going to do a good job that way. So researchers have to learn with their partners about how to say no and focus on the most important things. But that's only half of it, right? That's the research side. 

(00:48:51):
I have two thoughts about what companies should be doing. The first one, it's a little bit of an aside, but not really. One thing I learned by through the responses to the article was everybody came out of the woodworks from the variety of insights disciplines that are out there. Because I come from a tradition of user experience research or user research, but there are many insights disciplines in many industries, and they all wanted to claim one type of research or another, and say, "Oh, well, we overhear in consumer insights or market research have been doing that well for years." And there are many insights disciplines. And generally I think creating silos is stupid. 

(00:49:33):
Actually, I'm curious what you think, because here's the number one thing I heard when I joined Airbnb and you were there, is I did it a quick listening tour where I talked to a bunch of product people. And they all said the same thing. They were like, "Listen, we have all these different people throwing insights over the transom. And it's great. We want to hear from the data scientists, from the product specialists, from the customer service people, and the voice of the customer, whatever, all that stuff. But they're all coming over the side and we don't know what to make of it. It's too much."

(00:50:03):
And that, as much as anything, is an argument for companies to stop siloing research disciplines. So when I joined Airbnb, I set out to create an integrated insights function where it's like, "Let's do UX research, let's talk about the market and competitors when we have to. Let's integrate smartly with data science functions. Let's integrate all the stuff we're getting from customer service feedback." We brought over what was then the NPS program and said, "Hey, if we're getting customer feedback there, let's all just use it all to fuel this one insights machine." So that's the first piece of advice I'd give companies.

(00:50:38):
And the second one, without being a broken record, is to think differently about the broken cycle. So integrate researchers into a unified, lean process. So if the researcher is not there from beginning to end, if there are not strong relationships between product people and design people at every level, engineering people at every level, and somebody who's their insights partner, we're going to fall back into this problem where we're just a service discipline, we're not extracting the maximum value, it comes too late, we don't know what questions to ask, we're ignorant about what research can do. And so creating that integrated, lean process where a researcher is arm in arm from the beginning, is the most important advice I'd give.

Lenny (00:51:19):
That last piece may be the answer to this next question, but the question is how can product managers be better partners to user researchers/get more leverage out of user researchers?

Judd Antin (00:51:31):
I think that is in many ways the answer, making sure that they are creating a process for the product, for their products, that it integrates user researchers and insights from beginning to end. Also, being willing to partner with the research on the roofless prioritization. I used to say that, "A full plate for a researcher was probably three things, two big projects and a small project, like a side project. More than that, your researcher is probably not doing a very good job. And a project may take 48 hours. That's okay. But so they need your help to prioritize, they need you to participate. Great PMs will take the time to be with researchers to go into the field, even to travel." Did you ever do that, Lenny?

Lenny (00:52:15):
I did. I went with Louise, who introduced, we came up with this, basically told me to chat with you about this topic. 

Judd Antin (00:52:23):
Thanks, Louise.

Lenny (00:52:24):
Thanks, Louise. We did a whole tour to Paris, our whole team, or the leads of our team went to Paris to do a bunch of focus groups and a bunch of user research behind actual mirrors. I've never done that before that trip, and it was amazing. We learned a ton.

Judd Antin (00:52:38):
Can I tell you a quick story about behind the mirror? 

Lenny (00:52:40):
Please.

Judd Antin (00:52:41):
This is back from when I was at Facebook. And there was the high times there, it was like 2012, '13, and newsfeed is really taking off, ads are going into newsfeed. And I was a leader of a team that was working among other things on how to address post quality. Like, "How do we think about what's a good post and how do we get feedback about it?" And so there was a team of engineers that thought, "One thing that you can do on Facebook is hide a post." So they were like, "This is easy. Let's look at the posts that are hidden the most and use that as the signal of what's a good post on Facebook?" Seems reasonable. And something tripped me on this one. And so I did two things.

(00:53:26):
So the first thing I did is I looked at the distribution of hiding by user, and found out that it's power law distributed, like everything on the internet. There are a few people on Facebook who hide a ton, and then most people don't hide at all. And so then what we did was, we call these super hiders, we called them super hiders. And so we said, "Let's find super hiders around the office, and we'll get a super hider in, and we'll do a really traditional user interview." We just wanted to see. So literally the first person who walked in, I remember, because this was a person who had those fingernails that are so long, you don't know how they can do touchscreens, but they did. They were amazing at it. And it was one of those rooms with the glass. And I insisted that the ENG directors, the product people, and they were willing, whatever.

(00:54:20):
So everybody's behind the glass, and I'm there with them, and the excellent researcher is in the room, and they come in, and we're just doing a traditional think aloud study. And so they go, "Hey, can you open up your Facebook app? We would just love to see what your experience is like." So they open up Facebook, and were looking, and they look at the first story, and they hide it. They go to the second story and they hide it. And this went on for a while. 

(00:54:43):
And she's definitely using Facebook, but every time she'd finish with a story, she'd hide it. And the people in the back room were starting to chatter. And they're like, "Wait, what? What is happening right now?" And like the good researcher that this person was, they let it continue, and they're like, "Whoa, can you tell me what you're thinking right now?" Come to find out that she was like, "Well, I hid that story because I'd seen it already." The model she was going for was inbox zero, which was sad, because it was infinitely scrolling. She would never get there. 

(00:55:16):
And the reason I liked that story is because the people in the back room had their minds blown. It was not that we assumed that was common behavior, like this person could have been unique, but it was enough, because those people were there, experiencing the research, that N of one allowed them to burst their own bubble and realize, "Okay, we can't think so naïvely about hides as a signal anymore." And we came up with a better solution.

Lenny (00:55:47):
That is an awesome story and such a good example of you don't need statistical significance to get massive insights. One example just gives you a, "Wow, this might be exactly what's happening. Let's go validate that." Versus, like, "We are confident, 100%, this is what happened." I love that. It reminds me actually in the mirror study that I was talking about in Paris, there's a Facebook element to it, too. We were trying to convince hosts how to feel more comfortable accepting guests who are booking instantly. And one of our theories was if they were connected on Facebook, they would be more comfortable letting someone book instantly. 

Judd Antin (00:55:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:21):
And we're just like, "Hey, what if you were to connect Facebook and see if they're friends?" And everybody in Paris was very afraid of connecting and giving Facebook any data, way ahead of what the US hosts were feeling. 

Judd Antin (00:56:34):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:34):
So it just made it very clear nobody wants to actually give Facebook any data. So it was very anti-Facebook at that point.

Judd Antin (00:56:40):
Yeah, that's so interesting. Germany and France were always our bellwethers for what the rest of the world would be thinking with data privacy concerns.

Lenny (00:56:49):
Oh, man. Okay, a couple more things. A lot of this started with a lot of layoffs within user research. And I think between the lines, there's a sense of teams don't need as many researchers as they hired during the ZIRP era. I think a question in everyone's mind is just like, "How many researchers do we need? What is a good ratio?" I imagine there's not a simple answer, here, but just what's your general advice to companies of how many researchers is it right?

Judd Antin (00:57:15):
This is a thing I've thought a lot about, especially in my role as the head of the design studio, that was my fundamental question. It's like, "You have all these writers, designers, researchers, how do you structure them, how many, and where, and who works on what?" And the organizing principle for me was always relationships. You know you have enough when the people who need to have a concept research partner have them. And I would much rather create pain in that situation than spread someone too thinly. So my advice was always like, "Don't try to create a researcher to cover this entire product space. Pair a researcher up with somebody who's going to involve them in a consistent, engaged process, and let them go to work, and see the impact they're going to have, but protect their time. And then other people are like, "Wait a second, that person's doing great work. I want some of that."

(00:58:02):
And creating that pain for them, because it's a pain of loss, is the number one way to grow headcount. That's how I always approached getting more headcount, was not arguing abstractly for why research is important, but by asking partners who wish they had it, to do the arguing for me. And so you're right, there isn't a clean answer for like, "Hey, this is the right ratio," because it really depends on the nature of the product. Like, "Is it a early stage product? Is it a late stage product? Are we talking about a startup or a late stage company?" But I would argue there's always room for a researcher. Lenny, I'll tell you, and I used this in a keynote talk I gave lately. You published recently a list of, I think it was about 20 B2B companies and their first 10 employees. Do you remember doing that?

Lenny (00:58:51):
Absolutely.

Judd Antin (00:58:52):
Do you remember how many researchers are anywhere on that list? I'll give you a hint.

Lenny (00:58:57):
Not too many.

Judd Antin (00:58:57):
It's between zero and two. It's one. There's one researcher on that list, anywhere. Anywhere. And that's messed up to me. Now, look, it's just these 20 companies, and each is in their own space, so I'm not going to overgeneralize. But a researcher can drive incredible value no matter what stage a company is at, because a good researcher makes you go faster, not slower, and they drive impact because they answer questions which are impossible to answer in any other way. That's true if you're a startup. It's true if you're a late stage company. Now, if it's your first 10 employees, one researcher is going to go a long way. As you grow, making sure that you're matching up researchers so that they have strong partners in the key parts of the business is the best way to figure out if you have enough.

Lenny (00:59:45):
Interesting. So your advice is, as you're starting a company, your pitch is that you'll have a lot more leverage and move faster hiring a researcher versus generally an engineers, but you'd be trading off, essentially. That's what most of the hires end up being.

Judd Antin (00:59:58):
I am reluctant to overgeneralize, and I would say I know many founders who are in startup mode are like, "I know what I need to build. The problem is that I need people who can help me execute." And I think that's right. And so everything's a trade off. But remember, imagine that you could have that Swiss army knife at your disposal. Maybe you've got an MVP out the door, and you're looking to make your first major iteration, or like many startups, you need to pivot. This is where it's like, "Hey, you don't have to do that alone." We deify startup founders who pivot appropriately, but I think that is what we would might call moral luck, where we deify the ones who got it right, and even though they made exactly the same decisions as the one who got them wrong. 

(01:00:46):
And the fact of the matter is, if you have an insights person with you who has that Swiss army knife of tools, you're not in it alone. You don't have to guess. Ultimately, it will still come down to a tough decision that you and founders have to make, but you can have evidence that bears on that decision, which you wouldn't be able to get any other way.

Lenny (01:01:05):
To close out on this, and I have just a couple more questions on this thread, I think one of your big messages to researchers is, "You can be empowered. It's up to you to do the right sort of research and to move your career in the right direction, not become a researcher people don't need." And there's this quote that you have at the top of your post, where a lot of the reaction, or I guess the way you put it is, "I know what you're thinking, they just don't get it. We're so misunderstood. Our plight is to deliver insights that users use to drive business value while we're forgotten, never driving the roadmap, no seat at the table, consistently miscast, only to be laid off in the end." And what I'm hearing from you is like, "You can change that. You can push back on doing research that isn't actually contributing." But let me ask you, what's your lasting, I don't know, advice you would leave researchers with to be successful?

Judd Antin (01:01:56):
Yeah, it's tough to be operating in a broken system, and so I feel that response, where you feel kind of powerless, but I think that's not likely to lead us past this moment to the next evolution of research. So that's where it's like I don't blame any researcher at all for being in the spot they're in. It's been a tough go. However, crying about our lot is not going to get us anywhere. So I think the point of the article for me, and this is advice I give companies all the time when I do consulting with them, is like, "Hey, we can set this up in a different way, which responds to the current environment in a way which will drive a huge amount of impact." Now, that takes companies making the right choices. It also takes researchers owning up and developing skills, pushing back, understanding what research can have the most value, developing the skills, and the knowledge, and language around the business, becoming more influential, being excellent communicators.

(01:02:55):
It's one of the things I would evaluate the most in hiring, especially research leaders, because I needed them to show and teach by example, is like isn't just rigorous research. It's like if a tree fell in the forest and no one was there to hear it, you need to communicate it effectively, and you need to do it in a way that's appropriate to the audience. Because If I'm talking to you, Lenny, it's different than I'm talking to Brian Chesky at Airbnb. And so I got to be able to give that presentation effectively, and get right to the heart of it, and speak the right language. And so if you're a researcher, it's not hopeless. Actually the discipline, the future is so bright, and we can help it along by continuing to develop these different skills as companies build a model that's more inclusive.

Lenny (01:03:38):
Awesome. Okay. I have one just random, tangential question about NPS. You have strong opinions about NPS, and I just wanted to hear your perspective on the value of NPS, your experience with NPS. 

Judd Antin (01:03:50):
Yeah. I do have a strong opinion about NPS. I like to say, "NPS is the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself." And the problem is this threatens many people's livelihoods, because there's an entire industry of consultants and software providers that want you to believe NPS is a useful and accurate metric. The problem is, the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes. So it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. So the likelihood to recommend question is bad for a whole variety of reasons. So it's bad because it's a zero to 11 scale. It's bad because it's usually unlabeled. So we label the polls, but that's not the gold standard for research. It's bad because it's 11 items. 

(01:04:37):
And there's a couple of problems with that. Number one, we find that precision goes down after five items on average, maybe seven. Number two, especially on mobile, if you're taking this survey, what percentage of those options are below the fold? We are not going to get accurate survey data. And so from a survey perspective, it's really bad. There's also this intuition, which is like, "How likely are you to recommend Windows 11 to your friends and family?" I am not a person who goes around recommending operating systems. The question is fundamentally flawed. 

(01:05:11):
The argument is that that question is a good indicator of loyalty, but there's a really simple solution, Lenny. Customer satisfaction, a simple CSAT metric, is better. It has better data properties, it is more precise, it is more correlated to business outcomes. I wanted to prove this. This is something that survey scientists know and marketers don't want you to know. And so we did the work with Mike Murakami, who led survey science at Airbnb, and he's still there, great researcher. And we basically redid all that work to find out if all that stuff was true just for Airbnb. And it is. It's simple. Don't ask NPS, ask customer satisfaction

Lenny (01:05:50):
And the customer satisfaction question, what's the actual question for people to make sure?

Judd Antin (01:05:54):
Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with Airbnb? Or it could be some version of that, which is like, "Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with customer service when you had a problem?" So there could be a more specific version of that question, but those questions have better properties. And a lot of people say, "Well, hey, everybody's using NPS. So at least it gives me a benchmark because I can compare my NPS to industry NPS." The problem with that is the research shows that NPS is idiosyncratic, so it goes up and downs in ways that we don't understand, and there's a lot of inconsistency in how it's asked, that creates variations in the data, which means it's not apples to apples, so you can't even compare your NPS meaningfully to somebody else's.

Lenny (01:06:37):
I love these hot takes. I'm curious to see who comes out of the woodwork, too, when-

Judd Antin (01:06:41):
People are going to be so mad, Lenny.

Lenny (01:06:42):
I love that. I think, yeah, I've heard this many times and people don't talk about it. Okay. Is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Judd Antin (01:06:54):
Can I? Yeah, I want to add one thing if I could, because this has come up on your podcast a few times recently, which is about the idea of people doing their own product walkthroughs. So should a PM just rely on their own dog fooding of the product and their own walkthrough to figure out how to fix it? And a couple of times recently this has come up, and I think the consensus seems to be, "Yes, this is a good thing." And I have a contrarian opinion there, too, which is that I think it is really important for everyone to dog food their own products. The problem is related to relying on your intuition about those products, which is the thing most PMs have trouble with is realizing, "You are nothing like the user. You are nothing like them in ways that will bias the way you think about what's good and bad in your product in ways that you can't necessarily recognize. Some things with a product, some problems with a product, you need a pulse to recognize."

(01:07:57):
And most good PMs that I know have a pulse and so cool. But a lot of them require context of use, priorities, constraints that you just don't have and you can't imagine purely on the basis of your own usage. So what I think that means is that you should definitely dog food your own product. Doing product walkthroughs to identify lists of potential issues is a great thing to do. Prioritizing that list, figuring out which ones are more or less a problem, and for whom is an area where you should be extremely wary of relying on your own opinion, expertise, or intuition when you are dog fooding your own product.

Lenny (01:08:39):
Thank you for sharing that. It's definitely come up a bunch on this podcast, so I think that's an important lesson for people to take away. Anything else before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Judd Antin (01:08:49):
I appreciate you, Lenny. Thanks for having me on. 

Lenny (01:08:51):
I appreciate you, Judd. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Judd Antin (01:08:56):
I am ready.

Lenny (01:08:57):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Judd Antin (01:09:02):
I recently read a business book by Barbara Kellerman called Bad Leadership. And what I love about it is that we spend a lot of time talking about good leaders, and she really dives into the worst leaders and what makes them bad leaders in a way that I think is really valuable for everybody. 

(01:09:19):
I'd also recommend, I read a lot of fiction, so two recommendations, there. One, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver. It's an outstanding read that also is really sad, and moving, and illustrative, especially if you want to understand rural poverty. And then completely other side of the fiction spectrum, if you're interested in science fiction, which I am, read the Murderbot Diaries, it's about a sarcastic killer robot. And who doesn't love them?

Lenny (01:09:48):
I love these fiction recommendations. I feel like we need more of these on the podcast, so thank you. 

Judd Antin (01:09:52):
Yeah. Everybody goes to business books.

Lenny (01:09:53):
Yeah, absolutely. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Judd Antin (01:09:59):
We recently watched The Last of Us and it blew our mind. I watched it after I played the video game after long last, if you are a person who plays video games and you haven't played The Last of Us, play it. If you don't know, the show is based on the video game, not the other way around.

Lenny (01:10:14):
Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Judd Antin (01:10:19):
Think of a topic that you had to explain lately that was the most complex, and then explain it to me like I'm five. And there are a lot of ways to vary that question, but the reason I like it is because I think, and I've asked this question to VP and C-suite candidates in multiple disciplines, and sometimes it's related to a conversation, like I might ask them to explain something complicated about quantum computing, or music theory, or it could be a complex business decision, but I want to see if somebody can break a complex problem down in a really simple way, and give me an intuition for it in a short amount of time. I think that is a differentiator between good and great for many people.

Lenny (01:11:02):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Judd Antin (01:11:06):
Yeah, this is a really weird one, but my whole family started indoor rock climbing recently, and there's a challenge you have when you top rope, which is that you're looking up all the time. So they make these glasses, which are called belay glasses, and they have an angled mirror embedded in the lens, so that you can look straight ahead, and the view you see is up towards the person who you're belaying. And I just thought that product is so perfect for that. That's a niche problem and there isn't a better way to solve it.

Lenny (01:11:37):
Do you have a favorite motto that you often come back to, that you share with friends either in work or in life that you find useful?

Judd Antin (01:11:44):
Yeah. This is going to seem like pandering, Lenny, but I don't know if you remember a conversation that you and I had, it must've been eight years ago. I remember where we were sitting. And it was about stoicism. Do you remember this? Anyway, we had this conversation.

Lenny (01:11:59):
I don't, but I was into stoicism for a while.

Judd Antin (01:12:01):
I know you were, because we talked about it. And so the motto comes from stoicism, which is basically, "Focus on the things you can control and ignore the rest." And a lot of people think of this as the serenity prayer or the serenity saying, that was a 20th century invention, but Epictetus was writing about this BC, and I think about it all the time. So much of the stress, and pain, and worry that we have in life comes from things we can't control. So I try to let those things go.

Lenny (01:12:34):
Amazing. I learned that lesson from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and just the importance of thinking about these circles of you can control, you can influence, and you have no control over, and there's no reason to think about those other things.

Judd Antin (01:12:46):
Absolutely.

Lenny (01:12:47):
Judd, this was everything I hoped it would be. We got into some really good stuff. I'm excited to hear how people react. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to learn about what you're up to, actually share what you're up to these days, and how people can find you, and then also how can listeners be useful to you? 

Judd Antin (01:13:01):
Yeah. Thanks for asking those questions. People can find me at juddantin.com. That's the best way to find out what I'm up to. These days, I'm a consultant. I help people with UX strategy, org design, and crisis management. Somehow I love dealing with other people's dumpster fires, and I've found that I'm constitutionally good at it somehow. So juddantin.com is the place to find out. I also write. I write a medium post that you can find at onebigthought.com. And you'll find a lot of the topics we talked about today, including the original post that started this at onebigthought.com. If there's one thing I could ask your listeners to do is to get next to your researcher. I just think if you build those relationships and involve a researcher and insights person early and often, beautiful things will happen for you and for the business. So that's the thing everyone can do for me.

Lenny (01:13:56):
I love that. I've always done that. I loved my researchers that I've worked with, many of them reporting to you, and so beautiful takeaway. Judd, thank you so much for being here.

Judd Antin (01:14:07):
Lenny, thank you. It's been a pleasure.

# Leveraging mentors to uplevel your career | Jules Walter (YouTube, Slack)

## Transcript

Jules Walter (00:00:00):
If you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean? 

Lenny (00:00:14):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:00:14):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:00:26):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Jules Walter. Jules is a product leader at YouTube. Before that, he spent four and a half years at Slack, where he was their first growth PM and then went on to lead their monetization teams and also their mobile team. He's also the co-founder and a board member of the Black Product Managers Network and CodePath, both of which are nonprofits that aim to increase diversity within tech. Jules and I have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, including a killer guest post on building product sense that continues to be one of the most shared and beloved posts in my newsletter. 

(00:01:04):
In our conversation, we focus on what skills matter most in advancing a PM's career, and more importantly, all the ways Jules has found to build those skills. We also go deep on mentorship, how to find a mentor, what to look for in a mentor, how to get someone to agree to be a mentor, and a lot more. I super enjoyed this conversation, which I'm sure you can tell. Jules is such a gem of a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Jules Walter after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:36):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:03:49):
Jules, welcome to the podcast.

Jules Walter (00:03:52):
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited.

Lenny (00:03:54):
I am even more excited. This chat has been a long time coming. I've been hoping to get you on this podcast ever since this podcast even launched. And then in the meantime, while we've been waiting to schedule it, a number of guests have mentioned how useful you've been to them in their career, and so I'm just really excited to finally have you on.

Jules Walter (00:04:11):
Yeah, same here.

Lenny (00:04:12):
Let's just start with a quick overview of your background. Could you share some of the wonderful places you've worked, some of the wonderful projects you've worked on, and then just a bit about what you're working on today?

Jules Walter (00:04:25):
Yeah, happy to. Some quick background, grew up in Haiti, studied computer science in college, went to business school. My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content.

Lenny (00:05:35):
Amazing. The reason that I think we pushed this schedule of this podcast recording out is because you've been working on that product for many months and I'm glad to hear that it's finally launched. How did the launch go?

Jules Walter (00:05:45):
So far so good. It's really exciting to take a product from nothing to something. 

Lenny (00:05:49):
Especially at a company like Google.

Jules Walter (00:05:51):
Yeah. And then over time we are adding more exciting content onto the product. We just recently you announced that we're adding NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023 to primetime channels and also to YouTube TV. It's been a really exciting project.

Lenny (00:06:05):
That's awesome. I bet there's a lot of stories there, but I know you can't talk too much about what's happening at Google, so we'll move on. I like the point that you made about joining a startup, like you were trying to get into product management and you joined a startup as their first PM. I think you mentioned that's how you got into the PM path or I guess... Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's an interesting example of one of the paths into product management: joining a startup, getting into product there.

Jules Walter (00:06:27):
Not as their first PM, but I joined as one of their first PMs. Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:31):
As one of their first PMs? 

Jules Walter (00:06:32):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:06:33):
That's something I hear often is just one of the paths to product management is join a startup, start doing product, and then you're a PM. And then you have a PM title on your resume and you can now join other companies. Is that something you found or anything you can take away from that experience?

Jules Walter (00:06:46):
Yeah. It's really, really hard to get into product and there isn't a really set path to do that. What I've seen is the path that we just talked about, join a startup and then from there go into different companies. And then the other path that is typical is being at a company and then switching product management, especially if you develop domain expertise and there's a need for a PM. So, that's even more frequent. Of course there's also acquisitions that sort of thing, but making that initial transition is really hard.

Lenny (00:07:19):
I didn't realize you were the first growth PM at Slack. That is a big role. How did that work out? How did you become the first growth PM at Slack? Was that the first time you're doing growth? What's the story there?

Jules Walter (00:07:30):
I joined Slack early 2016 and the role that was available at the time was growth. I did not know anything about growth, but I was like, "Hey, this is my way in at such a great company." So, that's what I joined to do. And then what I did there was really take a learning mindset and lean on mentors, and we can talk about that to really learn the practice of growth and applied for Slack.

Lenny (00:08:00):
Cool. We're definitely going to talk about some of those things. Just thinking about that experience and that ride at Slack, what's like maybe the most tangible memory or most, I don't know, interesting story of just riding that rocket ship of Slack growth as one of their early PMs?

Jules Walter (00:08:14):
There's many, many stories. My experience was I got in, didn't know much about growth, and then through mentorship, in particular, one mentor, Bangaly Kaba, sort of learned how to apply growth frameworks to my work. And then when I did that within six months, I was able to ship changes in the new user experience, especially on mobile. That moved the needle by a lot, like double-digit percentages within your [inaudible 00:08:38]. And we're talking about top line metrics like activation. It was just interesting being able to have such impact very quickly at a company, and then the company itself went through all these milestones. I mentioned I joined 50 million, the next thing it's a hundred, and it keep doubling, going through a public offering. So, there's just so many stories that are unique to hyper growth.

Lenny (00:09:01):
You also didn't mention in your background all these kind of extracurricular activities that you have. I've always been impressed with how much time you put into things that are kind of just volunteer projects on the side. Can you talk about some of the stuff that you do outside of your actual day job?

Jules Walter (00:09:15):
Outside of my work at YouTube now and also my family and young kids, I'm also involved with two nonprofits that I co-founded. Both of them are actually about improving diversity in tech, which is something I'm really passionate about. The first one is called CodePath and it's improving diversity for software engineers, and the second one is Black PMs focused on product management. With CodePath specifically, what we do is we train over 5,000 students every year at universities, typically the university with strong underrepresented populations, and we help them find internships and jobs at top tech companies. And then with Black PMs, we have a community of over a thousand PMs and aspiring PMs and then we help them find community and also grow their skills. Both of them are nonprofits that I wasn't actually setting out to build them. It's more like I had the need myself or I wish I had those sort of support when I was earlier in my career. And then I started helping folks and then one thing led to the other, especially my co-founders, and then these became big.

Lenny (00:10:22):
Sounds like a classic startup story, solve your own problem and turns into a larger and larger thing. I think I try to work with Black PMs as much as I can, and I know that you recently had a conference, which is so cool. I don't know, it was a really big conference that you organized. I don't know how you all had time for all that, but anything you can share about this conference and is there another one coming?

Jules Walter (00:10:42):
Now we have a really good team at Black PMs. The CEO, Brittany Bankston and the team, Benin Saffo and others, have helped put together that amazing conference that I was able to attend. It's amazing that it's hard for underrepresented community to see themselves in podcasts, at conferences, at speakers, that sort of thing. So, it gave that opportunity and it also enables us to realize that you're not alone. Because part of why I created Black PMs with my co-founders is... Actually, I'll tell you the story. 

(00:11:17):
I think it was around 2016, I was at a barbecue. I met another Black PM, Maryanna Quigless. I didn't know her and I was like, "Oh, you're a Black PM at Facebook. How many of you are there at the company?" And we're joking and we're like, "Hey, I bet we can list all the Black PMs we know." And we had basically roughly 15 between the two of us and we're like, "Hey, let's bring them all together in a room and to have a community." From there, started helping each other and that grew from 15 to now over a thousand.

Lenny (00:11:45):
Wow. Amazing. It's really inspiring, the work that you do. I don't know how you find time for all this. I love that you found ways to kind of delegate this and have other people run the program now.

Jules Walter (00:11:55):
Yeah. Now, I'm mostly on the board of these organizations. We have really solid teams for both Black PMs and CodePath, and the teams are just really amazing.

Lenny (00:12:03):
This touches on the stuff that I want to spend most of our time on our chat, which is around mentorship and just generally becoming a stronger product manager through all the ways you can become a stronger product manager. You mentioned you had a lot of great mentors. I've heard from other people, you've been a great mentor to them and you've also just been really successful at a number of really world-class companies. What I want to chat about is just, what have you found to be the most important skills to develop as a PM as you advance in your career, and then how to actually build those skills partly with mentorship, partly other ways? Maybe just to start, what have you found to be the most important skills in your career that have most helped you advance in your career and other PMs around you?

Jules Walter (00:12:50):
In terms of skills, I think of it in terms of two buckets. One are IQ skills, intellectual skills, like what sometimes people call hard skills. And then the other things are the EQ skills, oftentimes called soft skills. What I've seen in my career is that early on, I leaned more into the hard skills, the IQ stuff. That was what was most helpful to me. And then later on, I spent more time getting better at the EQ skills. The reality with PMs is that within each of these buckets, there's so many skills and then you can feel overwhelmed, so my advice is really just start skill by skill. What I did specifically is I joined Slack, I was in ICPM. When you join a new company, especially if you're earlier in the mid-career, you really want to get good at things like execution, IQ skills, execution, product sense, strategy. So, those were critical for me, especially my first year at Slack. 

(00:13:51):
The other skill that I'll also call out, which nobody talks about for some reason, is interview skills, because so much of what gives you a chance to become better as a PM is working at a great company. How you get that job beyond networking is actually becoming good at interviewing. If you think about my career, getting into Slack changed my trajectory and I was able to do that because I got slightly somewhat good enough at interviewing. I barely got the job and then I was really good at execution and got better at these other things, product sense, strategy, et cetera. In that phase, the things that I was working on, as I mentioned earlier, were things like improving user activation. So, it relies on those skills: identifying the opportunities, running experiments, executing quickly, and so on. That's the first set of skills.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Before we move on, and the second set is EQ, right? Is that where you're going? 

Jules Walter (00:14:51):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:14:52):
Cool. Maybe just one quick thread I want to pull on is this interviewing skill. That's really interesting. Your point here is you're not... And I think you're going to get to this of just how to get better at these skills. You mentioned one of the best ways is to be surrounded by amazing people who can help you get better at these skills, but you won't get there if you can't actually get into a company like Slack. Is there something you've found to be useful in building these interview skills? When you say interview, it's being interviewed, not interviewing other people, like passing these interview tests. 

Jules Walter (00:15:22):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:15:22):
Yeah. I guess what have you found has been most helpful in helping you become a better interviewee?

Jules Walter (00:15:28):
When people tell me, "Hey, I'm going to a interview at this company." First question I ask is, "How many mock interviews have you done?" And the answer typically is zero. It's, "Oh, I read a bunch of stuff. I practiced in my head." But I'm like, "How many actual mock interviews have you done?" And I would recommend people to do dozens of those mock interviews. Now, the other thing about practice is it's always better if you deliberate practice. If you mock interview with somebody who's actually good at interviewing, then you'll get better faster. But even if you don't do that, just going from zero mocks to practicing in your head to actually doing mocks with peers and others is going to get you to another level. And then the other thing I'll say is interviewing can be quite traumatic and difficult for a lot of people, even me. I mean before I got this job, I interviewed at Google, I don't know how many times, over the last decade or two.

Lenny (00:16:22):
Wait. You're saying you're interviewed at Google many times and you didn't get in then you kept looking for new opportunities?

Jules Walter (00:16:27):
Yeah. I graduated from MIT and I think even since internship times in '07, I'd interviewed for roles at Google and I didn't get those roles or Meta or various other companies. It's because I wasn't good at interviewing and I didn't know people at those companies. By the way, most things you do, people give you some feedback so you can get better at it, but interviewing you never get any feedback. That's the thing people don't talk about, but it's actually an important skill or a barrier to underrepresented folks.

Lenny (00:17:01):
To actually get feedback?

Jules Walter (00:17:02):
Yeah. You won't get feedback after an interview at any company.

Lenny (00:17:05):
That's a really good insight of just people see you join a YouTube and are like, "Oh, yeah, of course he's going to get into YouTube." But you're saying that you actually tried to interview and get into Google many times and it took a number of attempts and advancing your career a little bit before you actually... So, don't feel so discouraged if it doesn't work out. 

Jules Walter (00:17:23):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:17:24):
In terms of this mock, that's a really important point of just actually doing the interviews, like practicing, practicing, practicing. Not just reading questions but actually testing and practicing interview. If you were interviewed at a big company, there's a lot of videos out there of like, "Here's the questions they ask. Here's what they look for." And you're saying find people that work at the company and do these sorts of interviews with them. For companies that are smaller that maybe don't... It's not as obvious what they're going to ask you. Do you have any advice on how to find someone to do a mock interview with or how or what to actually be talking through?

Jules Walter (00:17:56):
Yeah, it's hard at smaller companies. However, I think interviewing even at bigger companies will help you [inaudible 00:18:04]. A lot of the times the bigger companies have more rigorous processes. So if you can do well there, then it is a bit easier elsewhere. But the key is really that practice part, which people overlook.

Lenny (00:18:18):
Cool. Well, maybe one last question there and we'll move on. Do you have any favorite resources or just advice of where to go find the questions to mock interview with and then who do you look forward to do these interviews with, like just find someone at the company or one of these larger companies that you respect to mock interview with?

Jules Walter (00:18:34):
I mentor a bunch of people who talk about various communities that exist out there. I can follow up on those, but there are large communities of people prepping for these companies. The key is really just being a part of a community and doing the mocks. And then the last thing I'll say on this is interviewing is hard and especially, I think, hard for underrepresented folks because it's high pressure. It's high stress, high ambiguity-

Lenny (00:19:02):
So much stress.

Jules Walter (00:19:03):
... coming into a company. I've gone into companies like an interview and then the whole panel, nobody looks like me. I walk into the cafeteria, nobody looks like me. And then you are interviewing and you have all this self-talk about, "Hey, do I even want to work there? Will I belong," while you're trying to solve complex problems. So, that's also the other part companies don't think about. What I do, like folks at Black PMs that I coach, is really help them find groups of people, like small groups. Let's say three of us, et cetera, three to five, and then you practice with that group who are going through the process. And because you like the people, then it makes it a bit more fun and it also can help you prep for your own nerves in those interviews.

Lenny (00:19:48):
What I'm hearing is, and I know we hear this all the time, if you're, say, a Black product manager, it's so much harder to not just get in because there's potentially bias at the company, but you're just psychologically not feeling as comfortable because nobody looks like you. You're worried that they're going to have bias against you. Is that what you find?

Jules Walter (00:20:07):
Yeah, that has been my experience and it's also what I hear from a lot of people I mentor.

Lenny (00:20:13):
Your advice there, and this is helpful to anyone also, is just practice even more because that's probably the best way to get over that as much as you can.

Jules Walter (00:20:21):
Yeah. You want to basically practice so much that even at your worst, you're good enough. I've always felt like most interviews, I literally did my worst. It's just that it was good enough to pass. You're so stressed out, you don't relate to the person, et cetera.

Lenny (00:20:38):
Got it. Okay. Let's go back to the question I asked that I pushed us away from. We were talking about what skills as a PM you want to be focusing on that mostly will help you in your career, and we started with IQ. I wrote a couple notes, so there's the concrete skills, execution, products and strategy, interviewing, and then there's a second bucket of EQ.

Jules Walter (00:20:57):
So, the IQ I already talked about. Those are the skills that help me at, especially in my first year at Slack, drive big good experiments, design good product experiences, and then drive results. But then what happened is as I get promoted, managed people and then start having larger scope, then there's a lot of ambiguity and stress that comes in with that increase in scope. And that's where the EQ stuff shows up a lot, specifically things like communications, because it's no longer my team. It's like cross-functional partners, other teams, executives, so you have to communicate all the time to different people. And then the other thing is things like leadership. Now, I'm driving initiatives that involve multiple teams, basic company level OKRs, and then the other thing too is beyond leadership, which is managing your team as well. How do you be a good manager? How do you deal with the ambiguity, stress? How do you influence various people? 

(00:21:58):
These are the EQ skills. What I've seen is, number one, it's much harder to learn these skills than the IQ stuff. The IQ is very intellectual. Sometimes, you just need a mental model, practice a bit. The EQ, I'm still learning these things. It's just like every... I'm trying to get better. Then the other thing beyond it being hard to learn is that the EQ stuff... What you need to focus on is specific to you, so you learn it. You probably work on something different than what I would work on versus if we're both trying to be better at strategy or execution, there's a lot more overlap. So, there's a lot of self-awareness that you need to have to know even what to work on and then you need to continuously practice it.

Lenny (00:22:44):
What did you find was the most important EQ skill for your career that helped you in this journey?

Jules Walter (00:22:50):
I don't know if there is one that single-handedly was the most important. I had to develop on many of these things. I can tell you, for example, communication is something that is helpful, especially as I become more senior. What happened for me is, early in my career, it was more about clarity and then conciseness. Then later it became more about how do you tell a story, and then also how do you communicate in an empathetic way. Specifically, you're telling the same story or presentation but to different audiences, and each time you have to adjust it because the CEO will care about this part, the CFO will care about this other part, and so on. I think that's one area where I spend a lot of time. And then the other thing also that has been helpful is the self-awareness part that I mentioned, where through mentorship, especially mentors who were very honest and help me see my blind spots, I was able to see my own patterns.

(00:23:54):
When I'm under stress, for example, I tend to withdraw and not see anything. So, then you might think I'm disengaged. By the way, in an interview context you might be like, "Oh, does this person even want to work here?" Then once you know these patterns you know, "Okay, I'm stressed right now, but I need to say something so that people see that I'm actually interested in this problem; I'm just thinking through it. Well, let me verbalize my thought process." So, that's me as an example. For you, it might be the opposite. The self-awareness piece has been really helpful and it's something I continue to work on.

Lenny (00:24:26):
That's an interesting point that it's important to understand how you react and to figure out what's unique about you that you want to be working on, especially within EQ. For this example you gave about how stress impacts you, how did you actually discover that? Was that this mentor just pointing out, "Hey, Jules, I've noticed this happens," or is there anything else there that maybe folks would find useful?

Jules Walter (00:24:47):
Generally, you need someone to put a mirror in front of you irritably. Sometimes, it's like you hire a coach, I talk to, and they see patterns. I've done group coaching too. In this case specifically, he was a mentor. His name is Lawrence Ripsher. He was head of product at Pinterest and became a mentor and now a close friend. One day I was preparing for... I think I need to do a representation and he was like, "Hey, I've noticed that when you are thinking, you're just quiet. Let me tell you what's going on in my own head when I see that." And then he was like, "Hey, I'm telling myself that he's not interested in what we're doing." And I'm like, "Really? That's the least thing." And then I realized that's a pattern I have. Over time, through him and others, I've also observed other patterns.

Lenny (00:25:38):
I missed this, but was he a manager or just a mentor you had within the company?

Jules Walter (00:25:42):
We didn't work at the same company. When I was at Slack, he was head of product at Pinterest. We met at a dinner and then from there, over time, he became a mentor and then we started meeting. When I would hit difficult situations, sometimes I would call him and ask for advice, and then through those interactions he's helped me identify some of my blind spots.

Lenny (00:26:08):
Okay, awesome. We're definitely going to talk about mentorship and how to work with a mentor, but let's kind of wrap up this EQ piece. You mentioned within EQ, skills to think about working on communication, leadership, and management. Is there anything else and then is there an example of one of these skills and how, I don't know, it helped you in your career or held you back until you figure out how to work on this?

Jules Walter (00:26:30):
High level, I think those buckets are pretty broad: comms, leadership, management. Within each of them, there are various skills like setting vision, strategy, listening to learn, those sort of things. It's actually the type of things that Matt Mochary talked about when he came to speak at your podcast. I mentioned communications was one thing, right? What happened was, when I was at Slack, I was pretty good at writing, which by the way I was terrible at long time ago. It took me years, maybe decade, to get better at. But then when it was time to present... I was fine at presenting, but then if you ask me questions, things would crumble. That even happened to me once at an interview, where I did well presenting and then they asked me a question and then I just gave an answer that wasn't good. 

(00:27:22):
Then the self-awareness part helped me figure out what was going on. For me specifically, I realized whenever people ask me questions, if I didn't know the answer, I would have all this negative self-talk and I basically... You'd ask me a question and of course it could be something like, "Why are we doing it this way?" And it might come from a place of curiosity, you're just like, "Hey, I don't know. Can you tell me why you have more context," right? But in my head I would hear, "I don't agree with this." And that would be my self-talk. "Oh, this person doesn't agree with this," instead of being present and trying to understand where are they coming from and maybe asking follow-ups like, "Hey, thanks for asking the question. Is your concern more about, I don't know, scalability of this approach or is it more that you don't think it's effective even if it's not scalable?" 

(00:28:10):
You know what I mean? For someone else, it might be the easiest thing, but for me it took me months and months to, first of all, figure out that I had this pattern. And then once I figured out the pattern, it took also a while to now actually act on it so that now I'm comfortable. If you ask me a question, sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, let me get back to you." Sometimes I don't know and I'll say, "Hey, I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking." This little thing that may seem so obvious to you took me a while and different people have different versions of these blockers.

Lenny (00:28:45):

(00:29:54):
I love these stories and this is a good segue to start talking a bit about not just what skills to focus on, but how to actually get better at these things and identify these patterns in yourself. There's like a bunch of skills we just named, so let's also talk about where you think you start as you're starting off as a PM, which skills to focus on first, second, third. Let me just ask this broad question. We've talked about all these different skills PM should have. What have you found to be most effective broadly at building these skills in your career?

Jules Walter (00:30:24):
I will share my approach. It might not work for everyone and later when we talk about strengths and weaknesses. You might see why that works for me. What I do specifically is when I'm trying to learn something new, I try to think about what is an outcome that I could drive. And if I drive this outcome, it will be proof that I'm better at this thing. If we go back to this story of when I joined Slack, I didn't know anything, literally anything about growth. And I was telling myself, "I hope they don't fire me." But then the outcome I wanted is, within six months, I wanted to ship enough experiments that were successful, that drove activation by, let's say, X percent. So, that's very concrete. 

(00:31:06):
Then once I have this outcome, I work backwards to figure out how am I going to do that. One of the things we can talk about later when we talk about strength is that, for me, I'm really good at asking questions. What I do then is I start asking questions like, "Okay, I'm trying to drive activation for Slack. What are some frameworks that I should use to drive activation? What are best practices? What are examples?" I have a sense of the kind of question that, if I were to answer them, I'd be able to drive the outcome. And then what I do is I read a little bit, not a lot about the topic, just to make sure I'm asking the right question. Then I refine my questions and then I find the best people in the field and I just go talk to them. That's where we'll talk later about the mentorship part. 

(00:31:54):
In the case of activation, I was like, "Okay, what's the company that defined growth?" At the time, Facebook. "Who are the people that I can reach out to that do growth at Facebook?" And one of them was Bangaly Kaba and also Adriel Frederick who spoke at your podcast. I had met both of them at a random event. Then I'm like, "I need to find a way to have a chat with these folks and to help answer those questions with them." So, that's what I did with Bangaly in particular and also Adriel to a certain extent. I then learned, "Okay, here are frameworks to use for growth." For example, understand, identify, execute. Spend a lot more of your time understanding why people aren't staying on Slack versus anything else, so then I had pointers. 

(00:32:40):
Once I have the pointers, then I try to go through the thing. I'm like, "Okay, now let me..." I call the user researcher, "Hey, can we do a research on people who are signing up on Slack?" Data analysts, let's look at the data. What correlates with activation?" Those sort of things. Then after I go through a look, where I actually see results, whether they're good or bad, I go back to the mentor and I'm like, "Hey, I did this. It was actually successful. Thanks a lot." Now, I'm thinking about this other problem." I keep going and that's how I rinse and repeat, and over time I drive the outcome and I also know I'm getting better at this thing by working with the experts.

Lenny (00:33:18):
There's a few interesting takeaways there. One, is that you kind of create a forcing function for yourself to learn a thing. It's like, "Hey, I'm going to learn this thing. Let's create a goal that my ass is on the line to hit and then that's going to force me to go figure this out." And then two, it's interesting how often you come back to mentors and other people around you helping you out, which is a really good reminder. You don't have to figure things out for yourself; there's people out there that know these things and they're happy to help. A question I want to ask and I'll save this, because I we're going to talk about mentorship specifically a little bit later, just like how to find these people. Not everyone has access to Bangaly and Adriel, and I'm curious just how you found these folks, how you recommend other people find folks like that. But that's an awesome example. One tactic you're talking about here is just work backwards from a forcing function you've created for yourself to learn a thing. And in this case, what was it you were trying to learn? You were trying to learn growth, is that right?

Jules Walter (00:34:11):
Yeah, I was trying to learn growth and I wanted to do it in a context of activation, like new onboarding. And then later I also wanted to learn growth but in a different context, which was monetization. How do you drive revenue growth, not just get more users? And then later it was things like, "How do I learn how to create a growth org? How do I structure my team? How do I set work streams that add up to a coherent strategy?" And you just keep going

Lenny (00:34:42):
In those examples, did you do the same thing, you found people to talk to? 

Jules Walter (00:34:46):
Yeah. Yeah. It's the same approach. Sometimes what happens is I have a few mentors that I just keep going to over the years and it's just a top exchange and sometimes I sort of get new mentors who are experts at these new topics. It's a combination of those two things for me. And the thing is you obviously can learn without this approach, but this approach makes you, at least for me, makes me learn so much faster.

Lenny (00:35:14):
That's probably one of the most interesting things I've learned about mentors, and you're touching on this, that people want to help. They're happy to help if people come ask, unless they're just dumb questions or they're just overwhelmed. People are generally very happy to help. People are always worried like, "Why would they spend any time trying to help me with this random thing?" It's really the opposite; they're happy to help.

Jules Walter (00:35:34):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:35:35):
Coming back to the EQ and IQ buckets, are there other examples of ways you've learned to improve, say, strategy, execution, product sense, things like that?

Jules Walter (00:35:46):
Whether you have a mentor or not, there's other things you kind of have to do. For me, for example, one thing I do is I try to identify what's the best practice for something. For example, let's say strategy. There was a phase where I got feedback, "Hey you need to be better at strategy." Then I'm like, "Okay. Well, can you help me understand what are people at this company that was awhile back, where you think have done a great job at strategy or what are examples of artifacts?" Then I get these artifacts and I reverse engineering them. I try to think, "Okay, what are the top questions, the answer? Maybe I'm not answering all these questions. How do they do it?" And you start seeing the patterns like, "This person did it in a memo, this person did it in a deck." So, it's not about the format, but what is it about? Then this person had a lot of data, this person is quantitative, qualitative. So, that's a big part of what I do as well. It's true for all these things. 

(00:36:47):
For execution, it would be things like me attending another PMs meeting. "Oh, I heard this person is amazing at executing. Let me just see how they're on a meeting." And then you're like, "Whoa, things we didn't notice." Or somebody is great at communicating and I'm like, "Okay. Well, did you send this email? It's great. Let me save it." I'd have docs where I saved templates of things, and a lot of the reason, I think, people don't learn through osmosis that way is because one is you're not at a company where you can see great artifacts sometimes. That's why I mentioned if you can get a better company, do that. The other thing, too, is even if you see the greatness around you, some people don't try to break it down, to understand: "Why is this one great and not that one?" So, I actually do spend a lot of time every week reflecting like, "Oh, I saw these docs that were great or I saw this presentation this person gave." I sometimes crash presentation audits PMs give to executives, just to see how they handle questions or these sort of things. A lot of it is just spending time observing as well.

Lenny (00:37:54):
I love this advice, it's so powerful. Just like, "Who is amazing at this skill? And let me just go watch them and learn from them."

Jules Walter (00:38:01):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:38:02):
Something that you touched on here is, and I talk about this a bunch, that one of the benefits of working at a large company like Google, like Slack, is that you have access to a ton of real examples of strategy documents and vision documents and roadmaps and things like that, that once you're out of a company, like me, nobody shares these things publicly because they're sensitive. One of the best benefits of working at a large company is they have access to real life strategy documents, vision documents, things like that, so you should really savor that and collect them and, to your point, just study them. And I love your advice of just working backwards from like, "Okay, here's a strategy that work. What is it about the strategy that I can use when I'm building my strategy? What questions are they answering? How are they structuring it?" Things like that. That's awesome.

Jules Walter (00:38:48):
Similar to the mentor point, people are actually happy to talk to you. They're even flattered because no one else asked them. "Well, hey, I read your doc. Can we talk about it?"

Lenny (00:38:54):
Right. Whoever gets the... What PM ever gets someone coming to them? "I love your strategy doc. Tell me all about it. I'd love to talk about that."

Jules Walter (00:39:06):
Yeah. And then the other thing I'll say, too, is a lot of learning happens through the iterations and not by seeing the final product. We all see these products, like the iPhone and name your favorite product, but you don't know what versions they tried and sort of eliminated. And that's the benefit you also get at a company that has great product management. I actually sometimes tell the PM like, "Hey, don't just show me the one you just did. When are you going to do your next strategy? Can I join you then? I just want to sit and watch you write down the outline and just understand your thought process," or "I want to see when you're going to write your next exec update and understand how are you..." And you see them go through these iteration and you see them do things like get feedback that you didn't know they were getting all this feedback from. So, seeing the backstage is also really helpful.

Lenny (00:39:58):
It's interesting. Just as you're talking, I'm reflecting on how many benefits there are to working at a world class company. You are surrounded by really smart people who you can talk to and ask for advice and watch how they operate. You have access to really incredible documents and artifacts that you can learn from. Also, just the logo on your resume is really powerful for future job opportunities, which then comes back to the interview skills that you talked about and how important it is to be good at that to get into a company like that.

Jules Walter (00:40:24):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:40:25):
Interesting. Okay. What about on EQ? Any examples of how you learned some of those skills that you talked about communication or leadership or management or anything along those lines?

Jules Walter (00:40:36):
Yeah. On the communications side, I read some stuff like Minto's Pyramid Principles. Extremely helpful and I know you had an article on that. 

Lenny (00:40:44):
Mm-hmm.

Jules Walter (00:40:45):
I mentioned also that whenever I see a great email exec update or whatever, I literally save it in a special folder.

Lenny (00:40:54):
I love that.

Jules Walter (00:40:55):
Also, by the way, I always ask for feedback more than I think many people and I try to see patterns in feedback. For me, one thing I've observed is I tend to write long sentences, coming from a Haitian-French background, but then I see that because I've seen enough feedback that are about it so I see the patterns. Or as I mentioned earlier, I used to not be clear like, "Are you saying this solution or that solution?" It's better sometimes to be wrong but clear than the other way around. That's on the comms side. And then the other things, it's mostly, for me, through mentorship, people like Lawrence helping me be real with myself. I've had a coach for a while and I also do group coaching, which I really love. Right now I'm doing group coaching with a company called Pathways to Leadership.

(00:41:48):
These sort of things have helped me infer what my strengths and weaknesses are and then work on them. And then one thing I'll say also about the EQ: it was the most frustrating learning for me. For the IQ stuff, within six months, sometimes three months, I can see clear progress when you see enough documents. You see five, six of them, you start seeing 80% of the patterns. But then with the EQ stuff, it's things I've been working on for years. I am better at them, but I still feel like I'm continuing to work on those things. And a lot of it is like lifting weights or building muscles; you have to do it every day or every week. And then if you stop doing it, over time you atrophy again. That's something that people need to acknowledge, too. Give yourself time and then also learn these skills one at a time ideally.

Lenny (00:42:45):
Oh, interesting. Can you talk a bit more about that learning skills one at a time? Is your approach just like, "Here's the thing, I'm working on this the next six months. I'm going to focus on that."

Jules Walter (00:42:53):
Yeah. My approach is typically I'll say, "I'm giving myself, I don't know, three months, six months." It depends on what [inaudible 00:43:00] I want to see in my behavior for these things and then I just go all in on that skill. Let's say I wanted to learn strategy, I'll be like, "Okay, I'm giving myself, let's say, six months." Every week, I'm going to do something related to learning strategy. It's going to be maybe I read the strategy for another feature product at my company and you just divide, right? Let's just say there's 10 features or 20, it doesn't matter. You just do one a week, so 20 weeks. You see what I'm saying? And then the other thing is, every week I'm also going to practice it towards my outcome. I'm going to spend, I don't know, three hours a week, maybe one hour a day, just thinking through my own product strategy. And I do that for six months. You do it enough that you get over the hump and then actually develop the skill. Now, the other approach you could take is... What most people do is they read an article on your newsletter or some other place and then like, "Oh, great. I learned an insight." And then you go back to usual.

Lenny (00:44:00):
And it's not like at the end of these six months, you're done. I'm strategy expert, I am good on strategy. To your point, it's building this muscle that will never be fully built. It just will get stronger. And every time you invest time learning something, it gets stronger.

Jules Walter (00:44:15):
Yeah, exactly. It's not that within six months you are clearly better. Now, you can invest another six months to get to the next level. Or you could say, "Now I'm going to switch focus to another skill and get that one to a similar level."

Lenny (00:44:28):
Is there a skill you're working on right now?

Jules Walter (00:44:30):
Always working on something. One I can call out is listening. One thing about the EQ stuff, too, by the way is you hear these words, and depending on how familiar you are, you understand or don't understand what it actually means. When I say listening, I'm good at seeking information to solve a problem. If you come to me and you're like, "Hey, Jules, I have this problem," I will know what to listen for and what to ask you. "Hey, Lenny, can you tell me A, B?" And then I'll help you solve the problem. However, there's also different listening patterns, one of which is you just create space for someone. It's not like you're seeking a particular information, just give them space to tell you what they want to tell you. And then the other side of it, too, is you help that person feel heard, "Hey, I feel like you actually understand me and you've heard what I'm saying." So, that's the part I am working on.

Lenny (00:45:25):
You mentioned the Matt Mochary episode. I imagine you've been listening to that, because that has a lot of great advice.

Jules Walter (00:45:29):
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. It's those kinds of things, right? And then he talked about saying back to people what you heard, asking for more information, et cetera.

Lenny (00:45:38):
Awesome. You mentioned that you asked for feedback from your peers, and I wrote that down. I wanted to double-click on that a little bit. How do you actually approach asking for feedback? Do you sound like a survey? Do you just ask people in meeting? How do you do that?

Jules Walter (00:45:51):
The feedback piece, it's something that I had to get better at. Over time, I'm asking for it, because what I realize is if people don't feel comfortable with you, they won't give you feedback. It's depending on the risk, right? Especially if it's constructive feedback. By the way, that's also something that's hard about being underrepresented. People sometimes don't have the same natural level of connection with you. I basically learned to go out of my way to make people comfortable giving me feedback. There's different techniques and Matt Mochary also talks about some of them. Sometime it's basically ask in a very specific way, "Hey, I did this presentation. I'm working on, I don't know, having more executive presence. Did you feel that? To which extent did you feel that I showed executive presence?" So, it's a very specific thing versus, "Hey, how did it go?" That's one thing you can do. 

(00:46:45):
Other thing you can do sometimes is you give yourself critical feedback in front of them and then you give them a chance to agree or disagree. "Hey, I feel like this presentation didn't go well for this reason. What do you think? But actually I thought it would've been fine; however, this other thing could have been better." And then the other thing I'll say that is very, very important if you're asking people for feedback is if you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key. What people knew at Slack, Google, et cetera, is if you give me feedback, I'll be like, "Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful," because people are like, "Oh, he actually likes the feedback." Now, inside, my heart might be melting. I'm like, "Oh, I thought I got better at this." You know what I mean?

Lenny (00:46:45):
Yeah. 

Jules Walter (00:47:42):
But externally, I'm like, "Hey, thank you," and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't sort of focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.

Lenny (00:47:51):
That is such a good advice, all these very tactical ways of getting actual real feedback from people.

Jules Walter (00:47:55):
Yeah. And then one thing I'll say, too, by the way, it's harder to get feedback on the EQ stuff, and that's also why it's harder to develop and why a lot of people reach terminal levels in product, because people are like, "Oh, they lack emotional intelligence." They say that in calibration rooms but not in your face, so that's also what you want when you hear feedback. You don't want just to like, "Hey, here's my piece of feedback that I can prove." You also want the part that is like, "Here's how you make me feel or how you come across that... If this is taken out of context, it won't be good for... I don't want this to be shared publicly or taken out of context, but I want you to know." And it could be things like, "Hey, when I talk to you, sometimes I feel like, I don't know, you're angry." And then I'm like, "Oh, really? In what scenario?" And then it's like, "Oh, I was so focused and listening to you intently that I could see now why I come across that way." 

(00:48:55):
But you could literally go your whole career and then nobody ever says these things, right? And that's the kind of feedback that I personally find most helpful is the subjective feedback, because nobody will tell me those things. Once somebody I trust tell me and I'm like... Oh, here's an example. I mentioned earlier I'm good at asking questions. I had somebody ask like, "Tell me. Hey, sometimes when you ask questions, you sound more junior." And I was like, "Huh." And then I can see that because I asked the question plainly like, "Hey, why did you do this or how did you that," instead of also saying where I'm coming from, "Hey, I noticed this blah, blah, why, blah?" You know what I'm saying? Instead of showing I have an understanding of the thing and then asking a follow-up question, I just ask the question bluntly without context and people feel like, "Hey, I'm asking a very basic question." So, that's the kind of feedback that I particularly value.

Lenny (00:49:48):
The feedback you're getting is pretty incredible, like the stuff you shared about someone saying you come across as angry in a meeting if you ask questions or you sound a junior. I don't know if I've ever gotten anyone to give me that brutally honest feedback. When those specific cases, what was it about these people that helped them give you this feedback? Is that what you talked about, you built trust with them over the years or is there something you did to get that kind of feedback?

Jules Walter (00:50:10):
I mean, it's definitely they trusted me and they cared about me. They trust that if they tell me the feedback without translating, that I would see the intent behind it. And they were able to do that, because after months and years of working together, they know how to respond to feedback. Because what happens is most people, when you have to get feedback, you kind of have to really do a lot of translation work so that it lands, "I don't want to hurt your feeling. I don't want you to take this." I just told people, "You don't have to that with me." That's one. And then the other thing, too, is people reciprocate also how you talk. I'm not saying I talk to people like this, but I try to be vulnerable with people so they know we can be vulnerable and things are safe like, "I really want to hear things the way you experience it."

Lenny (00:50:59):
Got it. So, there's a lot of foundation setting that you do to create this environment where people are like, "Jules, here's something that's going wrong. You can work on this." 

Jules Walter (00:51:05):
Yeah. 

Lenny (00:51:06):
That's an awesome takeaway. One other thread I wanted to pull on is you mentioned focusing on strengths and how that ends up being really important. Something I'm a big believer in is focusing on strengths versus trying to make your weaknesses much, much stronger. Is there any advice you can share to better understand what your strengths are, why that's an approach to take in developing your skills?

Jules Walter (00:51:28):
For the strengths, breakthroughs. For me, a lot of it was talking to my mentor, Lawrence Ripsher. And I organized this event for Black PMs at Pinterest, where Lawrence was speaking, and then we were talking about, "Hey, watch should we talk about, et cetera." I don't know how, but in the conversation he talked about doubling down your strengths more than on fixing your weaknesses, and then he used me as an example. Then the fun part is he had this approach of how you actually find your strength. It's a very simple question, where basically he's like, "Hey, what is something that a lot of people say you're good at, but you think it's not a big deal or it's not that important?" And that's the key. I always that's what resonated with me. I was like, "Oh, a lot of people keep saying I'm really good at networking."

(00:52:26):
I'm like semi-introvert, so I'm like, "Hold on, I don't know." [inaudible 00:52:32] not everyone or people will tell me, "Hey, you have asked great questions." And I'm like, "I asked basic questions." And then he helped me understand, "Actually, that's how you know it's a strength." Now, what you need to figure out is how do you get more out of that strength. An analogy, by the way, is imagine that you saw a fish and you were like, "Hey, you're really good at swimming." And then the fish would be like, "Oh. Duh, doesn't everybody swim?" And so, that's the key and I invite people to think about that question like, "What's something people keep telling you you're good at, but you yourself don't think is a big deal?" And that's how I was able to find a bunch of my strengths. ]

(00:53:09):
For me, generally I'm thoughtful, ask great questions. I also simplify problems a lot. I mean, we work together on a product sense article, which is a very complex thing, made it more simple. And then once you identify the strength, then it helps to also think about why are you good at this thing? Because that's the underlying resource that you have. A big part for me is I'm actually quite curious. And fun fact, I don't think of myself as curious, but people keep telling me I am. And even my mom was telling me when I was a kid, I used to always try to unscrew toys to see how they work in the inside. That's one thing: being curious help me ask the questions and so on. And then the other thing, too, is once you have the strength, you want to understand the shadow side of it, and that's the connection between your strength and weaknesses.

(00:54:02):
That was a key breakthrough for me, especially Lawrence helped me understand that. Strengthen and weakness, it's not a binary thing. It's like the same thing, but it's a dial. In some context it's good, in other contexts it's serving you. An example in my cases is... I talked about I ask great questions, but sometimes I ask a question without context, I might come across as less knowledgeable. Or another thing for me is I'm able to take very complex problems and then create a mental model that's much simpler, whether it's growth or other things. But until I come up with that mental model, if I'm in a meeting with you, I won't talk much about that topic. Basically, I'm more quiet than other people when people want to hear my point of view because I'm just listening and trying to create a mental model of the situation. You're seeing how the same strength is perceived as a weakness depending on context. And once you have that... For me, I feel more empowered. I'm like, "Oh, I just have to dial down a little bit here or dial a little bit here," and I also know this thing is serving me, which is why I keep doing the bad side of it.

Lenny (00:55:10):
Awesome. This all often comes back to mentors in your life. I want to get to talking about mentorship and how you find your mentors, how you work with them, all that kind of stuff; something we've been touching on a bunch and I'm excited to begin to. Maybe to start, can you just talk about some of the mentors you've had in your life, some of the most impactful mentors that you've had?

Jules Walter (00:55:35):
I've definitely had a large number of mentors over the years. Fun fact, when I came to the area eight years ago, I didn't know anyone.

Lenny (00:55:42):
Wow.

Jules Walter (00:55:43):
It took a while to build those relationships. I talked earlier about Bangaly Kaba who sort of helped me figure out how to grow Slack even though he wasn't working outside, but helped me have the frameworks. I talked about Lawrence Ripsher. He helped me discover my strengths and also how to lean into them. Aaron Teague is another friend and mentor who brought me to Google, actually. And there's also Bradley Horowitz, former VP of Google Photos, also helped me in terms of how do you think about leadership and so on. Many other folks, Nikhyl Singhal, VP at Meta helped me with PM career. So, lots of mentors for sure.

Lenny (00:56:23):
Okay, that's the killer list. Two questions. One, what do you look for in a mentor when you're trying to find someone to work with? And then two, how do you actually find these people? Most people listening are like, "Wow, I would love an amazing mentor to help me in my career. I don't know how to find one." What advice do you have for folks to finding a mentor?

Jules Walter (00:56:41):
I look for two things. One is, are you good at one specific thing I'm trying to get better at? And then two is, are you good at explaining it? Those two, at least for me, they're important. I know people are really good at their roles, at their job and at the subject, but they don't actually know how they do it or they don't really want to explain or cannot explain easily. So, that's what I look for. And then in terms of where I find these people, it's really everywhere. If you look at the list I mentioned earlier, Bangaly I met at an event. Facebook had a recruiting event, I showed up, I see this guy, I'm like, "Oh. Hi." Chat a little bit. I talked about Lawrence, who's now a close friend. I met Lawrence at a dinner. He organized a dinner for underrepresented PMs, we chatted, one thing led to the other, and then he became a mentor and friend. Bradley was at a fundraiser. And Nikhyl was an intro via email. Somebody was like, "Oh, you should meet Nikhyl." 

(00:57:41):
I know this sounds counterintuitive. I don't think the hard part is where to find them; it's more about finding the right person and then how do you get a foot in? Now, what I've seen... A lot of people, sometimes they get mentors who are too senior or who don't actually think about the topic they're interested in. Maybe they did five years ago, but once you find the right person, the key is like, "How do you have that initial conversation? How do you get the foot in the door?" And what I've found is you should make the smallest ask possible, which is the opposite of what 95% of people do. 95% of people is like, "Hey, I've never met you, but I heard your talk or I saw you on LinkedIn or whatever. Can we set up a call?"

(00:58:29):
That's like a big ask. What I do... For example, there's this person who came to Slack, he was head of product of a major company and then he gave a talk about different methods to improve products. He had this concept of finding the heat for products. He spoke at the company, I got his email, and I reached out in the evening and I was like, "Hey, thanks so much for speaking today. We talked about finding the heat for products. Is there an example of product that you think was created with this approach?" Something he could answer in literally two minutes via email? That was my question. It wasn't like, "Hey, you talked. Now, I feel entitled to meet with you." But then the key is once you get that foot in the door, it could be a quick email, a tweet, a quick chat at an event, that sort of thing, and you get some advice that's useful, the key is to circle back with them at a later point and show that you've actually made good use of the advice. 

(00:59:30):
I think that's the thing nobody does. What I would do... For example, there's currently the CEO of a top tech company I met an event. She spoke there and then she gave some advice that was useful. I emailed her a follow-up type thing and then she gave me advice about how to rethink the mission statement for my nonprofit, all via email. Then at some point I was like, "Hey, I've applied your problem trend competency framework to crafting the mission for my nonprofit. Here's where we landed. That was super helpful. Thank you so much." Replies back. And then what I would do then later is maybe a month later or two months, X months later, I can reach out again for another problem and maybe I could say, "Hey, this time it's a little bit more nuanced. Can we grab 15 minutes?" And the person was like, "Yeah, sure." That person was very, very busy. I was like, "Hey, let's do it." And then over time we become Facebook friends, that sort of thing, but that's the approach I take.

Lenny (01:00:29):
That's such a good advice. It reminds me of Tim Ferris's advice also, which is just like, "Don't go up to someone and be like, 'Will you be my mentor?'" Everyone's going to be like, "I don't have time for that." Instead, to your point, it's the exact opposite. Just start asking simple questions and then over time build up relationship, and then over time, maybe you start meeting regularly. But don't start big; start small.

Jules Walter (01:00:50):
You. As small as possible.

Lenny (01:00:53):
It's not like you just have one mentor. You've listed a whole bunch of people that have helped you over your career. It's not like, "Here's the person, they have to be perfect." It sounds like you kind of identify, "Here's a skill or an area I want to focus and this person is going to be really good at that." 

Jules Walter (01:01:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:07):
Then I also just love the point about it feels really hard to find an amazing mentor. From what I'm hearing, the main thing you do is just go to things, attend events, basically go events, meet people, right? That's kind of the foundation in which you're sharing is just meet as many people as you can, and amongst that group, you'll find people that are probably going to be helpful.

Jules Walter (01:01:26):
Yeah. And I understand it can be harder for some folks. I mean, now I have two young kids, so I don't do as many events. I've also met quite a few people through introductions, sometimes being cold outreach. I had a chat with Shishir through cold outreach [inaudible 01:01:44] a very clear question, and then he offered to come to Black PMs and share some insights. Those kinds of things happen, too, but you have to show the person that you're going to make really good use of their time. You have to give really specific contexts like, "Hey, let's grab coffee." It's like, "Hey, here's a very specific question. Can you share some thoughts or point via email?" And then they might offer, "Hey, why don't we just talk?" That sort of thing, too. Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
That works really well. Anytime I get an email request of, "Hey, could we do a 15-minute Zoom or a copy chat," I quickly do not have time for that. But an actual question that I can be really helpful with really quickly, that's so much easier, so that makes a lot of sense. The next thing I wanted to ask you is: how do you build and continue this relationship? And then once you actually start engaging regularly, what do you suggest folks talk about in these meetings if they're ongoing.

Jules Walter (01:02:37):
I make sure to bring something very specific that I'm dealing with where they can provide input. And this is the opposite of what many people do where they're like, "Hey, can you tell me about how you... Whatever, your path to PM," which may or may not be relevant to them, versus, "Hey, I've interviewed for three companies. I'm trying to decide among those three. Can I walk you through my thought process and get your feedback?" So, it's very different. I definitely make sure I bring a very specific context, and sometime it could be... I mentioned the example of Bangali like, "Hey, I'm now a growth PM at Slack. I'm trying to improve activation. Can I talk to you about how you approach growth in general?" Or it could be, "Hey, I'm having internal..." Let's say I have internal mentors at Google and I have a few, then it's like, "Hey, I'm about to have this negotiation with this team. Can I walk you through my thought process and hear your advice?" So, it's very specific things. 

(01:03:37):
And then the other thing I'll say, too, is when I talk to mentors, I always take notes. I mean, I'm seeing you even here in this interview. You're taking notes. These are basic things people don't actually think about it sometimes. And then when I follow up, whether it's via email or in person, I bring up older conversations. It's like, "Hey, remember last time we told about X? I did it," or "Hey, how's your daughter? I know she was going to college this semester. How did that go?" So, it always feels like a continuation of a conversation and it feels like an actual relationship instead of transactional interactions. And then the other thing, too, is I try really hard to identify ways that I can be helpful. Sometimes, at the end of chat I'll be like, "Hey, is there anything I can help you with? Anything top of mind for you?" And sometimes the person could be senior or wealthy, doesn't matter, and they're like, "Actually, yes. I'd love to better understand how the team is really doing. Nobody will tell me the truth," or "Hey, I am trying to hire for this role. You have [inaudible 01:04:43] Black PMs. Do you mind sharing?" There's always ways you can help, but most people are so focused on themselves that they miss out on these opportunities.

Lenny (01:04:52):
The point about coming back to the person and sharing what impact their advice had and how it went is so good, because to your point, it just feels like you're sharing all this advice and just isn't going anywhere. And then note-taking, such great stuff. This is really good advice. I could see how it would work on me if someone's asking me for advice.

Jules Walter (01:05:10):
By the way, I mean we didn't know each other two years ago, right?

Lenny (01:05:10):
Yeah, that's right.

Jules Walter (01:05:14):
Yeah. It's like a similar process, where we got to know each other mostly via email and led to the other, and we try to help each other.

Lenny (01:05:22):
And look at us now. Any final thoughts before we wrap up and head to our very exciting lightning round?

Jules Walter (01:05:31):
I have found the process of learning how to be a PM very difficult and I also find it quite rewarding. And I want to set expectation, especially for people who are early in their career, people may be frustrated by the process, because you have all these skills. We listed, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen that you want to get better at. So, be patient. Then also it takes a while to see massive differences, but once you see those differences, you set yourself apart from your peers. That's one thing. And then the other thing, too, is it's really building muscles more so for the EQ stuff, but even for the IQ stuff. You have to practice. It's not just read Lenny's top 10 articles for two hours and then you're good. Read them, do what they say, get feedback after you do what they say and say like, "Huh, it worked for me. It didn't work for me." Reread them again, find mentors, et cetera. It's a long process and I don't think people have that mental model around how to learn in general, but also specifically how to learn the PM skills.

Lenny (01:06:41):
And I imagine there's also this one step forward, two step back experience that often happens, too, where you're just like, "Oh, I thought I figured out how to think about strategy, and this one failed." And you're like, "Oh, that was useless." No, this is how you learn. You fail sometimes. Oftentimes, it works out slowly but surely you move forward.

Jules Walter (01:06:57):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (01:06:58):
Amazing. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Since we've gone a little long, I'm going to keep it just four questions. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast, whatever comes to mind. Fire off. You ready? 

Jules Walter (01:07:10):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:07:10):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jules Walter (01:07:15):
One of them is Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. It's about negotiations. There's actually also a masterclass on it.

Lenny (01:07:21):
I was just going to say that. I watched that. That was really good. 

Jules Walter (01:07:24):
Yeah. Yeah. And then another one is Connect by Carole Robin. It's inspired by Stanford's Touchy-Feely class, if you've ever heard of it.

Lenny (01:07:33):
Yeah. She did a guest post for the newsletter, actually.

Jules Walter (01:07:35):
Oh, really? Awesome. Yeah. It's really a helpful especially as you are thinking about the EQ skills and how to improve your relationships with people.

Lenny (01:07:44):
Awesome. I highly recommend that book. I haven't read it, but I read a lot of things about the class and my friends have been in that class and she wrote this guest post. That sounds like a really good pick for EQ, so I'm actually going to re-pick it up. Next question: favorite other podcast that isn't this podcast.

Jules Walter (01:08:02):
Lex Fridman is one I'll call out. Brings really interesting speakers and also on diverse topics, so I find it really helpful.

Lenny (01:08:11):
Awesome. I also love that podcast. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jules Walter (01:08:15):
I watch fewer now. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie I really like. I'm sure many people have seen it. For me, it's like just going back in the 80s. And then TV show is Never Have I Ever. It's coming of age in America, Indian teenager. Pretty funny and also deep.

Lenny (01:08:34):
Awesome. I haven't heard of that one. We'll check it out. Final question: favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?

Jules Walter (01:08:41):
One I used to ask a lot is: what's something work related that you're trying to get better at? Sometimes I change the wording of it, but a big part of it is trying to understand how self-aware people are, to which extent they have a growth mindset, and then also how honest and vulnerable they can be. What I will say, though, about interview question, by the way, is I don't anchor a lot on the first question. What I find the most value from are the follow-ups. Once you ask that question, you can take in various directions like, "Why did you focus on this versus other things? How did this come to your attention? Was it feedback you sought or feedback people gave you, et cetera?" Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:24):
Awesome advice. Jules, this interview was a longtime coming. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you? 

Jules Walter (01:09:39):
In terms of finding me, Twitter is one place to start. My handle is @julesdwalt. And then in terms of how people can be useful, it's really about paying it forward and then sharing this with others, especially parts that people find useful.

Lenny (01:09:55):
Amazing. Jules, thank you so much. We'll chat again soon.

Jules Walter (01:10:00):
Yeah, thanks for having me.

# From managing people to managing AI: The leadership skills everyone needs now | Julie Zhuo

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

# OpenAI researcher on why soft skills are the future of work | Karina Nguyen

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
Not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge.

Karina Nguyen (00:00:06):
When I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh my God, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized, "Oh my God, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams, in particular?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:26):
Creative thinking and you kind of want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. I think it's actually really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):
What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:00:46):
When you taught the model, some of the self-knowledge of you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world, the model would get extremely confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
Today my guest is Karina Nguyen. Karina is an AI researcher at OpenAI where she helped build Canvas, tasks, the o1 chain-of-thought model and more. Prior to OpenAI, she was at Anthropic where she led work on post-training and evaluation for the Claude 3 models, built a document upload feature with 100K context windows and so much more. She was also an engineer at New York Times, was a designer at Dropbox and at Square. It's very rare to get a glimpse into how someone working on the bleeding edge of AI and LLMs operates and how they think about where things are heading. Canvas

(00:01:31):
In our conversation, we talk about how teams that OpenAI operate and build products, what skills she thinks you should be building as AI gets smarter, how models are created, why synthetic data will allow models to keep getting smarter and why she moved from engineering to research after realizing how good LLMs are going to be at coding. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Karina Nguyen.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta. And I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:22):
Great to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:25):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:32):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018. Focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:04):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:10):
That is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):
We appreciate you for doing that. And you have a special discount for listeners, they can get $1,000 off Vanta at Vanta.com/Lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/Lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:41):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:45):
Karina, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Karina Nguyen (00:04:48):
Thank you so much, Lenny, for inviting me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):
I'm very excited to have you here because not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge of AI and LLMs. You recently launched this feature, which basically... the first agent feature of OpenAI. I also just did this survey, I don't know if you know about this. I did a survey of my readers and asked them what tools do you use every day in your work and most use? And ChatGPT was number one, above Gmail, above Slack, above anything else. 90% of people said they use ChatGPT regularly. 

Karina Nguyen (00:05:23):
That's quite good. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:23):
It's absurd. It wasn't around two years ago.

Karina Nguyen (00:05:25):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
Also, we're recording this the week that OpenAI announced Stargate, which is this half trillion dollar investment in AI infrastructure. So there's just a lot happening constantly in AI and you have a really unique glimpse into how things are working, where things are going, how work gets done. So I have a lot of questions for you. I want to talk about how you operate and how you work at OpenAI, where you think things are going, what skills are going to matter more and less in the future, and also just where things are going broadly. So how does that sound?

Karina Nguyen (00:05:55):
Sounds great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I was extremely lucky to join early days Anthropic and learned a lot of things there. And I joined OpenAI around eight months ago. So, yeah, I'm excited to dive more in into-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):
Okay, I'm going to definitely ask you about the differences between those, but I want to start more technical and just dive right in. I want to talk about model training. People always hear about models being trained, these big models, how much data takes, how long it takes, how much money toss it takes, how we're running out of data, which I want to talk about. Let me just ask you this question. What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?

Karina Nguyen (00:06:36):
Model training is more an art than a science. And in a lot of ways we, as model trainers, think a lot about data quality. It's one of the most important things in model training is like how do you ensure the highest quality data for certain interaction model behavior that you want to create? But the way you debug models is actually very similar the way you debug software. So one of the things that I've learned early days at Anthropic was we've discovered especially this Claude 3 training, when you taught the model some of the soft-knowledge of, "Hey, you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world." But then at the same time you had data that taught the model some of the function calls, which is like, "This is how you set the alarm."

(00:07:30):
And so the model would get extremely confused about whether it can set an alarm, but it doesn't have a body in the physical world. So it's like the model gets confused and sometimes it'll over accuse. So sometimes it says, "Look, I don't know. Sorry, I cannot help you." And so there is always a balance trade off between how do you make the model to be more helpful for users, but also not being harmful in other scenarios. And so it's always about how do you make the model more robust and operate across a variety of diverse scenarios.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):
That is so funny. I never thought about that. Most of the data that it's trained on is kind of assuming it's like a human describing the world and how they operate. It assumes there's a body and you could do things, and the model is told you don't have a body.

Karina Nguyen (00:08:20):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):
Okay. I want to talk a little bit about data while we're on this topic. I know you have strong opinions here. There's this meme that models are going to stop getting smarter because they're running out of data. They're trained in a large part on the internet and there's only one internet and they've already been trained on it, what more can you show them about the world? And there's this trend of synthetic data, this term synthetic data. What is synthetic data? Why do you think it's important? Do you think it's going to work?

Karina Nguyen (00:08:47):
I think there are two questions here. We can unpack one at a time. But people say we are hitting the data wall. I think people think more in the terms of pre-trained large models that are trained on the entire internet to predict the next token. But what actually the model is learning during that process is actually how do you compress the compression algorithm here? The model learns to compress a lot of knowledge and it learns how to model the world. So the next prediction of the word, like, "Teach me how to drive," basically. And you only have a few words that will match that, a car. So the model actually learns about the world in itself. So it's like it's modeling human behavior, sometimes it's modeling... And when you talk to pre-trained models which are very, very large, they're actually extremely diverse and extremely creative because you can talk to almost any Reddit user through a pre-trained model.

(00:09:56):
But I think what's happening right now with new paradigm of o1 series is that the scaling in post-training itself is not hitting the wall. And that's because basically we went from raw data sets from pre-trained models to infinite amount of tasks that you can teach the model in the post-training world via reinforcement learning. So any task, for example, how to search the web, how to use the computer, how to write, wow, all sorts of tasks that you trying to teach the model all the different skills. And that's why we're saying there's no data wall or whatever, because there will be infinite amount of tasks and that's how the model becomes extremely super intelligent. And we are actually getting saturated in all benchmarks. 

(00:10:52):
So I think the bottleneck is actually in evaluations that we don't have all the frontier, like evals like, I don't know, GPQA, which is a Google-proof question answering, PhD level intelligence. The benchmark is getting to, I don't know, more than 60, 70%, which is what PhD gets. So it's literally hitting the wall in like evals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):
I want to follow both those threads. So the first is on this idea of synthetic data. Is a simple way to understand it, that the models are generating the data that future models are trained on and you ask it to generate all these ways of doing stuff, all these tasks as you described, and then the newer models trained on this data that the previous model generated?

Karina Nguyen (00:11:39):
Some tasks are synthetically curated. So this is an active research area is how can you synthetically construct new tasks with models to learn. Sometimes when you develop products, you get a lot of data from the product and user feedback and you can use that data too in this cross-training world. Sometimes you still want to use human data because actually some of the tasks can be really, really hard to teach. Experts only know certain knowledge about some chemicals or biological knowledge, so you actually need to tap into the experts' knowledge a lot. So yeah, I think to me synthetic data training is more for product... It's a rapid model iteration for similar product outcomes. And we can dive more into it, but the way we made Canvas and tasks and new product features for ChatGPT was mostly done by synthetic training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:52):
Let's actually get into that. That's really interesting. I want to talk about evals, but let's follow that thread. So talk about how this helped you create Canvas.

Karina Nguyen (00:12:56):
So when I first came to OpenAI, I really had this idea of, "Okay, it would be really cool for ChatGPT to actually change the visual interface but also change the way it is with people." So going from being a chatbot to more of a collaborative agent, and the collaborator is a step towards more genetic systems that become innovators ultimately. And so the entire team of applied engineers, designers, products, research got formed in the air almost out of nothing. It's just like a collection of people who just got together and we rapidly started iterating with each other. 

(00:13:46):
Actually Canvas is one of the... I would say the first project at OpenAI, where researchers and applying engineers started working together from the very beginning of the product development cycle. And I think there's a lot of things that we have learned on the way, but I definitely came with the mindset of, "We need to do a really rapid model situation such that it would be much easier for engineers to work with the latest model possible, but also learn from user feedback or early internal dog food. How do we improve the model very rapidly?"

(00:14:28):
And it's really hard to kind of like figure out how people... when you deploy a product, how people would be able to use it. And so the way you synthetically train the model is physically figuring out what are the most core behaviors that you wanted the product feature to do. And for Canvas, for example, it came down to three main behaviors. It was how do you trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Write me a long essay," when the user intention is mostly iterating over long documents? Or, "Write me a piece of code," or when to not trigger Canvas for prompts like, "Can you tell me more about President..." I don't know, some of the general questions. So you don't want to trigger Canvas because the user intention is mostly getting answer, not necessarily iterate over the long document. 

(00:15:28):
The second behavior is how do we teach the model to update the document when the user asks? So one of the behaviors that we taught the model is actually have some agency and autonomy to literally go to the document and select specific sections and either delete it or edit, so highlight it and rewrite certain sections. Sometimes the user would just say, "Change the second paragraph to be something friendlier," and we would have to teach the model to literally find the second paragraph in the document and change it to a friendly tone. So basically you teach both how to trigger edit itself, but also how do you teach the model to get higher quality edit for the document?

(00:16:21):
In case of coding, for example, there's also the question of how good the model is of completely rewriting the document, versus having a very specific target edits. So that's another layer of decision boundary within edit itself is, "Let's select the entire document and rewrite completely, or do you want to have a very targeted custom behavior." And when we first launched the model, we would bias the model towards more rewrites because we saw the quality of the rewrites were much higher. But over time you are shifting based on user feedback and what you're learning from iterative deployment.

(00:17:02):
Lastly, the third behavior that we taught synthetically the model is how to make comments on any document. So the way we used that is we would use o1 model to seem a way of user conversation, let's say like, "Write me a document about XYZ." But then we used o1 to produce the document and then we injected user prompt to be like, "Oh, make some comments, critique my piece of writing or critique this piece of writing that you just made." And then we taught the model to make comments on the document on very specific [inaudible 00:17:45] So it's also what kind of comments you want the model to make. Do they make sense or not? How do you teach the quality of that? And it all came down to measuring progress via very robust evals. But, yeah, this is how you used o1 and a synthetic data generation for the training.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):
Okay, that's so interesting. So you talk about this idea of teaching the model and you mentioned how it's using synthetic data to teach the model different behaviors is a simple way to think about it. Basically that's where you do that by showing it what success looks like using basically evals. Is that the simple way to think about it? Like, "Here's what you doing this successfully would look like," and that teaches it, "Okay, I see this is what I should be doing [inaudible 00:18:31]"

Karina Nguyen (00:18:30):
Yeah, great. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, you got it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):
Okay, got it. I want to start unpacking what your day-to-day looks like as you're building these sort of things. Is it like you sitting there talking to some version of ChatGPT, crafting these evals?

Karina Nguyen (00:18:44):
Sometimes I do that. Sometimes I do sit with ChatGPT. Actually, I think I learned this so much from Anthropic, is people spend so much time prompting models and where quality's a really bad batch all the time, and you actually get a lot of new ideas of how do you make the model better? It's like, "This response is kind of weird. Why's it doing this?" And you start debugging or something, or you start figuring out new methods of how do you teach the model to respond in the different way, have better personality, let's say. 

(00:19:19):
So it's the same thing of how personality is made in the models with those. It's very similar methods. But, yes, I think my time at OpenAI have changed. I think when I first came, I was mostly research IC work so I was like building a lot of... I was running code, training models, write evals, working with PMs and designers to learn, teach them how to even think about evaluation. I think that was really cool experience and I think it was just like an adoption of, "How do we do this product management of AI feature for our AI models?" Yeah, but now it's mostly management and mentorship. I'm still doing IC research code up to 4:00 PM, although. But I just kind of changed. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
All right, don't talk too much about being a manager.

Karina Nguyen (00:20:23):
Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
Because everyone's in firing their managers. "Who needs managers anymore?" That's what I hear now. Just kidding. It's interesting that so much of your time was spent on teaching product teams how evals integrate and how important it is. And I've heard this a few times and I haven't personally experienced it yet, so I think it's an important thread to follow is just how writing these evaluations is going to become increasingly an important part of the job of product teams, especially when they're building AI features and working with LLMs. So can you just talk a bit more about what that looks like? Is it sitting there with an Excel spreadsheet basically showing, "Here's the input, here's the output, here's how good the result was"? Talk about what that actually looks like very practically.

Karina Nguyen (00:21:02):
It certainly depends on what you're developing, but there are various types of evaluations. Sometimes I do ask product managers, or there's also new roles that we have, model designers, to go through some of the user feedback maybe or think of various user conversations that should have triggered... Under these circumstances, it should trigger Canvas. And then you have this ground truth label of, "Okay with this conversation it should look trigger Canvas, under this conversation it should not trigger Canvas." And you have this very deterministic kind of eval that for decision-making behaviors is like this.

(00:21:46):
When we were launching tasks, for example, how do you make correct schedules is actually really hard for the model. But we built out some of the deterministic evaluations that is like, "Okay, if the user says 7:00 PM, the model should say 7:00 PM." So if you can have deterministic evals whether it's pass or fail. And the way it works is all the... Sometimes I ask product managers to just go create a double sheet, have different tabs and what's the current behavior, what's the ideal behavior and why, and some notes. 

(00:22:27):
And sometimes they usually use it with evals, sometimes we use it for training. Because if you give the spreadsheet to o1 model, it can probably figure out how to teach itself a good behavior. And I think there are second type of evals that is more prevalent is human evaluations. And you can have specific trainers or you can have internal people to when you have a conversation of the prompt and then you have various completion of models, you choose the win rate. Which model is the best? Which model produce the highest quality comment or edit? And then you can have continuous win rates. And as you develop new models it should always win over the previous models. So it depends on what you want to measure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):
So interesting. Basically what I'm hearing, and there's something I'm learning about as I talk to people, is product development might move from this, "Here's a spec PRD, let's build it together and then cool, let's review it. Are we happy with this?" From that to, "Hey, AI, build this thing for me and here's what correct looks like," and I'm spending all my time on what does correct look like on evals essentially. 

Karina Nguyen (00:23:47):
You definitely want to measure progress of your model and this is where evals is, is because you can have prompted model as a baseline already. And the most robust evals is the one where prompted baselines get the lowest score or something. And then because then you know if you're trained a good model, then it should just hill climb on that eval all the time, while not also regressing on other intelligence evals. That's what I'm saying, it's more of an art than science. It's like, "Okay, if you optimize the model for this behavior, you don't want to brain damage in other areas of intelligence or..." This is happening all the time in every lab, in every research team. 

(00:24:35):
I would say prompting is also a way to prototype new product ideas. Early days at Anthropic when I was working file uploads feature, I remember I was just prompting the model to just... I remember we were launching a hundred key contexts. I was just prototyping this in their local browser. I did the demo. People really, really loved it. And they just wanted API for file uploads or something. And then that's when it clicked to me, and also one of the blog posts a long time ago, it clicked on me prompting is a new way of product development or prototyping for designers and for product managers. 

(00:25:20):
For example, one of the features that I want to do is have a personalized starter prompts. So whenever you come to Claude, it should recommend you starter prompts based on what your interests are. And so you can literally do it prompting for that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):
Mm-hmm. To experiment with that. 

Karina Nguyen (00:25:44):
Another feature was generating titles for the conversations. It's a very small micro experience but I'm really proud of. The way we did that was we took five latest conversation from the model, asked the model, "What's the style of the user?" And then for the next new conversation, the generated title will be of the same style. It's just like really little micro experiences like this. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
That's so cool. Did you do that at Anthropic or at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:14):
At Anthropic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:16):
Okay, cool. I love the file upload feature that Claude has by the way. ChatGPT doesn't have that yet, is that right?

Karina Nguyen (00:26:16):
I think has the way. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):
[inaudible 00:26:23]

Karina Nguyen (00:26:22):
I think the way it's implement is very different though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:25):
Okay. Maybe it's the PDF feature, because I use it all the time with Claude.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):
Okay.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:28):
That's cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Somebody needs to get on that. Main, it's wild how many features you built that I use every day and that many people use every day. This prototyping point you made is really important. It's something that comes up a ton on this podcast also of how that... is maybe the way that AI has most impacted the job of product builders recently is just prototyping instead of going from showing just like, "Here's a PRD, here's a design." PMs are more and more just, "Here's the prototype with the idea that I have," and it's working. You can play with it.

Karina Nguyen (00:26:54):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):
Yeah. Okay, I want to spend a little more time on how you operate. So you talked about you built this in launch of this tasks feature, is that the way to describe your tasks?

Karina Nguyen (00:27:04):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:06):
So talk about how that emerged and let's better understand just how you collaborate with product teams and how OpenAI works in that way, whatever you can share there.

Karina Nguyen (00:27:14):
I think Canvas and tasks are going into the bucket of projects where it's more short or medium terms. And actually the way Canvas and tasks came about to be was it started with one person prototyping and creating a spec. It's kind of like PRD. It's like creating a spec of the behavior of the model. I don't think tasks is extremely groundbreaking feature necessarily. What makes it really cool is because the models are so general... Model can now search, they can write sci-fi stories, they can search for stocks, they can summarize the news every day. Because the models are so general giving something familiar to people that notifications is very familiar, having reminders is very familiar. So feeling like a form factor for the people who are very familiar, same as Canvas, Google Docs is very familiar, but then you add magical AI moment and it becomes very powerful.

(00:28:26):
But the way it comes usually operationally... Yeah, size is like a prototype, literally prompted prototype of how you would want the model to behave. For tasks, for example, you need to design... Literally design thinking is like okay, well, if the user says, "Remind me to go to lunch at 8:00 AM tomorrow," what information does the model need to extract from that prompt in order to create a reminder? And so this is how you design a spec for a new feature, like a tool. Canvas and tasks are all tools. So it's like how do you create the tool stack?

(00:29:09):
And then it's mostly like developing JSON schema. It was like, "Okay, from this problem maybe the model should extract the time that the user requested." And then you think about which format do you want the time to be? And then how do you want the model to notify you is basically the user should give instruction to the model. And then this instruction would fire off every day or something at that particular time. So, for example, if you say, "Every day I want to learn know about the latest AI news," the model should rewrite into, "Okay search for the latest AI news and this task will get fired at that particular type that the user requested."

(00:30:02):
And then your design is like tool spec. Actually, I don't know. I feel like sometimes it's through conversations I... Either people ask me to join the [inaudible 00:30:15] team and they're like, "Oh my god, we need researchers." Or like, "We need some support. We need to train the models," or sometimes. Canvas was mostly like I just pitched the idea of... It got staffed quite immediately during the break, so it's dependent on the project. And then usually with staffing is mostly a product manager, model designer, actual product designer, a couple of researchers and a bunch of applied engineers. Depends on the complexity of a project. And then for tasks it took, I don't know, like two months or so to go from zero to one basically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):
Oh wow.

Karina Nguyen (00:30:54):
For Canvas this was like four, five months, I guess, to go from zero to one. And then you teach product managers how to build evals and maybe how do we not only ship the better feature, but how do we think longer term? What kind of cool features did you want tasks to have? I think it would be nice for tasks to be a little bit more personalized. It'd be nice to have to create tasks via voice on a mobile, right? This is how you get research roadmap right here is thinking how the feature will be developed in the future. 

(00:31:39):
And then from there it's like you start getting data sets. With evals, you want to make sure that goes well. And then you need to have a trade-off between what methods you want to use. And the reason why I really love relying purely on synthetic data instead of collecting data from humans is because it's much more scalable, it's cheap, less than half. You literally sample from the model and you teach the core behaviors of the models and that will generalize to all sorts of diverse coverage.

(00:32:15):
And when you launch the beta feature, you learn so much from the users that you can... All your synthetic sets can be shifted in the distribution and how the users behave on the product behavior. And this is how we improve. And this is what happened with Canvass too when we launched from beta to GA. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):
Okay.

(00:33:34):
Something that I want to help people understand, and I don't even 100% understand this, is what's the simplest way to understand the job of a researcher versus say a model designer and other folks involved? What's the simplest way to understand what researchers do at OpenAI?

Karina Nguyen (00:33:48):
So the project that I described are mostly product-oriented. Research is mostly product research. Another component of my team is actually more longer term exploratory projects. And it's more about developing new methods, understanding those methods under a variety of circumstances. So basically developing methods, you need to follow very similar recipe of building evals but it's much more sophisticated evals. You want to have outer distribution or if you want to measure generalization, you need to capture that. 

(00:34:26):
But it is basically more sciencey in a way where... If we talk about synthetic data, one of the hardest things about synthetic data is how do you make it more diverse? Diversity in synthetic data is one of the most important questions right now. And so it's like exploring ways to inject diversity as a general method that will work for all is one of the research explorations. Other ones is more developing new capabilities. I feel like it's always about you work on this new method and you have signs of life that it's working, either you think of how do you make it more general or you think of how do you make it very useful? And this is how the longer-term projects become more medium, short-term project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):
That makes sense. Essentially working on developing ways to make the model smarter, o4, o5, o6. New ways to... o1 was a big breakthrough, right? 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:25):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:25):
The way it operates where it's not just, "Here's your answer," it actually thinks and takes time to think through the process of coming up with an answer. Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (00:35:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:34):
Very helpful. Speaking of that, of thinking about the future, where things are going, I want to spend some time on just this insight that basically you are building the cutting edge of AI, at the very bleeding edge of where AI is going and where it is. And so I'm very curious to hear just your take on how you think things are going to change in the world and how people work based on where you see things are going. And I know it's a broad question, but let's say in the next three years, how do you see the world changing? How do you see people's way of working changing?

Karina Nguyen (00:36:08):
It's a very humbling experience to be in both labs, I guess. To me when I first came to Anthropic and I was like, "Oh no, I really love front-end engineering." And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized at that time it's like, "Oh my god, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps or something and so it can develop new features for the thing that I'm working." So it was kind of like this meta realization where it's like, "Oh my god, the world is actually changing." And when we first launched 100K context at that time, obviously I'm thinking about form factors that's like file uploads were very natural, very familiar to people. But you can imagine we could just make infinite chats in the Claude.ai app, as if it's 100K context. 

(00:37:04):
But because file uploads... It's like form follows function. It's like the form factor, the file uploads can enable people to just literally upload anything, the books, any reports, financial and ask any task to the model. And then I remember it was either enterprise customers, financial customers were really interested in that. It's like, "Oh wow." It's actually one of the very common tasks that people do in that setting. It's kind of crazy to see how some of the redundant tasks are getting automated basically by these smart models.

(00:37:48):
And they're entering the era where, I actually don't know for example sometimes if o1 gives me the correct answer or not because I'm not an expert in that field. And it's like, "I don't even know how to verify the outputs of the models." It's because all my experts know they can verify this. So, yes, so basically there are trends that are going on. The first trend is the cost of reasoning and intelligence is drastically going down.

(00:38:22):
I had a blog post about this. Maybe I should update on latest benchmarks, because at that time everybody was doing one benchmark and they'd be... quickly saturated the benchmarks. So I'm like, "Now we need to do the same plot but with another frontier eval." But the cost of intelligence is going down because it becomes that much cheaper. Small models are becoming even smarter than large models and that's because of the distillation research. 

(00:38:56):
This happened with Claude 3 Haiku. I was working with the training on the Claude 3 Haiku and I realized it was much smarter than Claude 2, which was way bigger, lots [inaudible 00:39:08]. But the power of small models become very intelligent and fast and cheap. We are moving towards that world. That has multiple implications, but the news is that people will have more access AI and that's really good. Builders and developers will have much better access to AI, but also it means all the work that has been bottlenecked by intelligence will be unblocked. 

(00:39:40):
I'm thinking about healthcare, right? Instead of going to a doctor, I can ask ChatGPT or give ChatGPT a list of symptoms and ask me, "Would I have a cold, flu, something else?" I can literally get the access to doctor almost. And there's been some research studies around that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
There was a New York Times story about that where they compared doctors to doctors using ChatGPT to just ChatGPT and just ChatGPT was the best of them. All doctors made it worse.

Karina Nguyen (00:40:18):
Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy, right? Education I think I would have dreamt if I had the tool like ChatGPT when I was young and would learn so much. But it's like people can now learn almost anything from these models. So they can learn new language, they can learn how to build new look apps and write anything they do want. It's humbling to have... launch Canvas and bring that thing to the people, enable them to do something else that they couldn't have ever before. There's something magical around this experience. 

(00:40:57):
Education will have massive implications. I guess like scientific research, I think it's the dream of any AI research is to automate AI research. It's kind of scary, I'd say, which makes me think that people management will stay. It's one of the hardest thing to... Emotional intelligence with the models, creativity in itself is one of the hardest things. So writers, I don't think people should be worried as much. I think will alleviate a lot of redundant tasks for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):
This is awesome. Okay, I want to follow this thread for sure. And it's funny that what you described as you were an engineer at Anthropic and you're like, "Okay, Claude is going to be very good at engineering. This isn't going to be a potentially career long term, so I'm going to move into research and AI is going to need me for a long time to build it, to make it smarter."

Karina Nguyen (00:41:53):
I would say we still have... I think Canvas team has still have really cool front engineers that are really people who really care about interaction, design, interacting experience. I don't think models are there yet I think if... But we can get the models to this top 1% of front-ends and things for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):
So what I want to move on to next along these lines is just, and this is just speculation, but what skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams in particular? So folks are listening and they're like, "Okay, this is scary. What should I be building now to help me stay ahead and not be in trouble down the road?" What skills do you think are going to be more and more important to build?

Karina Nguyen (00:42:42):
Yeah, I think creative thinking. You want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. Listening. You want to build something that the most general model will not replace you. And oftentimes you build something and you make it really, really good for specific set of users and actually the mode is now in your user feedback. The mode is more in whether you listen to them, whether you can rapidly iterate. The mode is in here. I don't think we are yet to... There are so many ideas, I think there's an abundance of ideas that you can work on. I wouldn't be worried. I feel like in fact I just think people in AI field are like... I wish they were a little bit more creative and connecting the dots across the print fields or something like that to develop really cool new generation and new paradigms of interactions with this AI.

(00:43:53):
I don't think we've cracked this problem at all. A couple of years ago I was telling some people, I was like, "You want to build for the future." So it's like it doesn't necessarily matter whether the model is good or not, good right now, but you can build product ideas such that by the time the models will be really good, it'll work really well. I think it just happened naturally. For example, at Anthropic the Claude artifacts... And I feel early days of Canvas was, back in 2022 before ChatGPT, writing ideas was our knowledge [inaudible 00:44:36]. But I feel like Claude 1.3 model itself was not there to have made really extreme good high quality edits. For example, like coding. 

(00:44:47):
And I feel like I see startups like Kaeser was doing super well. And that's because they iterate so fast. They invent new ways of training models. They move really fast. They listen to what users like, massive distributions. Yeah, it's kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):
That's really helpful actually. So what I'm hearing is that soft skills essentially are going to be more and more important, powerful. You just talked about management, leading people, being creative and coming up with innovative insights, listening. There's a post I wrote that I'll link to where I try to analyze how AI will impact product management. And we're actually very aligned, and my sense was the same thing, that soft skills are going to become more and more important. And the things that are going to be replaced is the hard skills, which is interesting because usually people value the hard skills like coding, design, writing really well. And it's interesting that AI is actually really good at that because it's taking a bunch of data, synthesizing it and writing, creating a thing, versus all these fuzzy things around of what influences, convinces people to do things and aligning and listening, like you said, creativity, anything along those lines come up as I say that.

Karina Nguyen (00:46:01):
I think it's actually a really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or do really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write. I still think ChatGPT kind of sucks at writing and that's because it's bottlenecked by this creative reasoning. I think characterization is one of the most important... I think for a manager, I feel like... 

(00:46:28):
Actually, AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, research management. It's because you have constrained set of compute and you need to allocate the compute to the research paths that you feel the most convinced about. It was like you need to have a really high conviction in the research paths to put the compute, and it's more return on investment kind of situation. It's like, "Okay, I'm thinking a lot about across all my projects, which projects are higher priority?" Prioritization and also on the lower level, "Which experiments are really important to run right now and which are not?" and cut through the line. So I was thinking prioritization, communication, management. People skills like empathy, understanding people, collaboration.

(00:47:23):
I think Canvas wouldn't be an amazing launch if it wasn't about people and I think it's a wonderful group of people. And I get a chance to work with people like Lee Byron who's a co-creator at GraphQL and some of the best Apple designers. It's so cool to see... and how do you create this collaboration between people. It's just something that's still humane, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):
Let me just follow through a little bit. I imagine people listening are like, "Okay, but once we have AGI or SGI it's like it'll do all this." There's a world where like, "Why isn't all this done?" I think it's easy to just assume all that. I'm curious this idea of creativity and listening, why you think AI isn't good at it, other than it's just very hard to train it to do this well. Is there anything there of just why this is especially difficult for AI and LLMs to get good at?

Karina Nguyen (00:48:20):
I think currently it's difficult for many reasons. I think it's still an active research area and it's something that I think my team is working on. It's like, "Okay, how do we teach the models to be more creative in the writing?" And so I'm thinking this new paradigm of wise that the models think more should actually lead to better writing in itself. But when it comes down to idea generation or discriminating of what is a good visual design or not, I feel like it hasn't had learned examples from people to discriminate it very well. I do think it's because there are not that many people who are actually really... It's not accessible to models to learn from these people I guess. So I definitely think that's why it sucks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):
Yeah, that makes sense. Basically there's not enough of you yet, researchers teaching it to do these things, slash people that have incredible taste and creativity that can teach these things. You could argue this will come. 

Karina Nguyen (00:49:31):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):
But we don't need to keep going down that thread. Let me ask you a specific question. In this post I wrote, I made this argument that a lot of people disagreed with that strategy is something that AI tooling will become increasingly great at and take over. There's the sense that that's the thing that people will continue to be much better at and you can't offload to AI basically developing your strategy, telling you what to do to win. My case is, "Isn't strategy, just take all the inputs, all the data you have available, understand the world around you and come up with a plan to win?" It feels like AI and LLM would be incredibly smart at this. What's your take?

Karina Nguyen (00:50:10):
I think so too. I think again, you teach the model all sorts of tools and capabilities and reasoning and it's like when it comes down to... For Canvas right now, it would be very cool for the model just aggregate all the feedback from users, summarize me the top five most painful flows on user experiences. And then the model itself is very capable of thinking of knowing how it's been made, figure out how to create a dataset for itself to train on it. And I don't think that we are far away from that self-improvement, models becoming self-improved by...

(00:50:54):
That, and the part of development, is basically self-improving. It's kind of like its own organism or something. Again, like strategies, it's more like data analysis and coming up with... I think what models are really good at is connecting the dots, I think. It's like if you have user feedback from this source, but you also have an internal dashboard with metrics and then you have other feedback or input and then it can create a plan for you, recommendations even.  And I think this is one of the most common use cases for ChatGPT too, is coming up with these sort of things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):
That makes sense essentially a human can only comprehend so much information at once and look at so much data at once to synthesize takeaways. And as you said, these context windows are huge now. Here's all the information, what's the most important thing I should do?

Karina Nguyen (00:51:59):
Yeah, same as scientific research. Ideally the model would be able to suggest ideas, new ideas, or iterate on the experimental given the empirical results of the previous experiments like how do you come up with new ideas or the methods?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):
Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, so just to close the loop on this conversation, this part of the thread is the skills you're suggesting people focus on building and leaning into is soft skills like creativity, managing influence, collaboration, looking for patterns. Is that generally where your mind is at?

Karina Nguyen (00:52:40):
Yeah, I'm thinking a lot about how do we make organizations more effectively and I think this is mostly management, I guess. It's like how do you organize research teams or generally teams combined... Compose teams such that they will be at their maximally succeed or at the maximal performance of what can possibly... We can literally create the next generation of computers. It's just the matter of conviction and the way you manage through that. It's scaling organizations or scaling product research, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):
Yeah, I think you're basically building this thing and not efficiently doing it is limiting the potential of the human species right now.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:16):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):
It's mismanagement within the research team in OpenAI and Anthropic and some of these other models.

Karina Nguyen (00:53:32):
Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Holy moly. Okay, so speaking of Anthropic and OpenAI, you've worked at both. Very few people have worked at both companies and have seen how they operate. I'm curious just what you've noticed about the differences between these two, how they operate, how they think, how they approach stuff. What can you share along those lines?

Karina Nguyen (00:53:48):
It's more similar than different. Obviously there was a lot of... There are some differences always comes to nuances. I would say culture. I really love Anthropic and I have a lot of friends there. And I also love OpenAI and they still have a lot of friends though. So it's not about enemies. I feel like there's in AI, it's all like, "Yeah, they're competitors. There's enemies." It's actually like one big community of people doing the same thing. I would say what I've learned from Anthropic is this real care and craft towards model behavior, model craft, model training. 

(00:54:32):
And I've been thinking a lot about, "Okay, what makes Claude Claude and what makes ChatGPT ChatGPT?" And it's like I still have some sense of operational processes that leads to the outputs, to the model. It's the outputed model. And it's like the reason why Claude has so much more personality and is more like a librarian... I don't know. I don't know. I am visualizing Claude being like a librarian at some point, very nerdy or something. ... is because I feel like it's the reflection of the creators who are making this model. And a lot of details around the character and the personality and whether the model should follow up on this question or not. 

(00:55:19):
What's the correct ethical behavior for the model in these scenarios? A lot of crafts and curated datasets. This is where I learned that part of art, I guess, at Anthropic. I would say Anthropic is much smaller. When I joined it was, what, like 70 people? When I left it was tons of people. And obviously the culture changed so much. I really enjoyed being early days startup lives, and people knew each other as a family. But the culture shifted. 

(00:55:53):
I would say that I learned from Anthropic that they're much better at focusing and prioritization of... Very hardcore prioritization, I guess. And they need to do it. But I think OpenAI's much more innovative and much more risk-takers in terms of product or research. Actually, in way your full-time job can be just teaching the model how to be creative writers. And it's like there's some luxury in this research freedom that comes with scale, maybe. I don't know. I'd say I have much more creative product freedom to do almost anything, I guess, within OpenAI, evolve ChatGPT into the vision that we want. It's more probably bottoms-up, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):
Yeah, that's how I was thinking about it. It feels like OpenAI is more bottoms-up, distributed, people bubble up ideas, try stuff. And that leads to more products launching, I imagine more things just kind of being tried versus more of a, "Let's just make sure everything we do is awesome and great and craft and thinking deeply about every investment."

Karina Nguyen (00:57:08):
Right. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):
That's really interesting. I've never heard it described this way. Karina, we've covered so much ground. This is going to help a lot of people with so many ways of thinking about where the future's going. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or get into?

Karina Nguyen (00:57:23):
One of my regrets, I guess, when I was early days at Anthropic was that... I think there was some luxury of the time, because pre-ChatGPT, to actually come in with a bunch of ideas and prototype almost every day. And I think that we did a lot of cool ideas like Claude, and Slack was actually one of the first tool-usey products. It's like Claude could operate in your workplace now. It's kind of cool because you can add Claude to summarize the thread. So maybe you have an entire conversation with someone and then you want a summary of what happened you can ask Claude, "Summarize this." 

(00:58:07):
Also, it was really fun to iterate on the model itself. It's like when you just talk to the model in Slack forever. It created some social element, it was kind like [inaudible 00:58:19] and this Discord, people learned so much about prompting and how to work with Claude. Actually, one of the features that was early tasks prototype is every Monday Claude would just summarize the entire channel. Or every Friday we'd just summarize a bunch of channels and give the news about the organization, or something. 

(00:58:48):
And it's kind of like really cool form factor. I think thinking about form factor's a really important question in AI, especially we haven't even figured out how do we create an awesome product experience with o-series models. It's like the paradigm between synchronous real time give an answer paradigm into more asynchronous paradigm of agents working on the background. But then now the question is the agents should build trust with you, right? And trust builds over time, which is like with humans. And you start this collaboration which is why this collaboration model with you and the model is so important because you build trust and the model learns from your preferences so that it can become more personalized and it will start predicting the next action that you want to take on the computer or something. And it's more predictive, much more... We went from personal computers to personal model basically here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):
Why is it not a thing? That seems like such an obvious feature that every LLM should have as a Slack bot version of them. Is that a thing I can help you install? Or is that not a thing right now?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:03):
I know that Claude and Slack was sunset in 2023 or something. I think it was after ChatGPT was mostly the focus on customer use cases or enterprise use cases.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):
Mm-hmm. Bummer. 

Karina Nguyen (01:00:19):
I think the form factor of Claude and Slack was kind of constrained a little bit when you want to talk about new features.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:28):
Bummer. I want that.

Karina Nguyen (01:00:30):
I know that ChatGPT had Slackbar tools. I don't know, maybe it will come back sometime.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:35):
All right, I would pay for that. Any other memories from that time of early days? Because that's a really special place to have been is early days Anthropic. Any other memories or stories from that time that might be interesting to share?

Karina Nguyen (01:00:48):
I think the very first launch when we felt... When click from use, again, was 100K context launch is when the models could input the entire book and give you a summary of the book or something. Or the financial... or catalog multi files financial reports and then give you an answer to the question, to very specific questions. I think there was something in there that was kind like, "Oh my god, this is a really cool new capability." Not model capability, but more like the capabilities that came from the product form factor itself rather than the model capability as much. 

(01:01:34):
I think other prototypes that we were thinking about... There's one part having a Claude workspaces and it's kind of the same idea of Claude and I would have this shared workspace and that share workspace is like a document and we can iterate on the document. And I feel like sometimes the ideas, [inaudible 01:01:55] and they're locked for two years, just like in this case. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
It's interesting, there's these milestones that kind of open up our view of what is happening and where things are going. ChatGPT think was the first of just like, "Wow, this is much better than I would've thought." You talked about 100K context windows where you could upload a book and ask it questions and have it summarize. I actually use that all the time. When I have interview guests and they wrote a book, I sometimes don't have time to read the whole book. So I use it to help me understand what the most interesting parts are. And then I actually dive into the book, just to be clear. And then, I don't know, maybe voice was another one where you could talk to say ChatGPT. Is there any other moments there that you're like, "Wow, this is much better than I thought it was going to be?"

Karina Nguyen (01:02:39):
Yeah, I think the computer use agents, like the model operating the desktop. And you can essentially think of new kind of experience where the model can learn the way you browse. And from that preference it can just browse as just like you. It's kind of simulated persona. And it's actually very similar to the idea of like, "Okay, maybe Sam Altman doesn't have a lot of time. Maybe I want to talk to his simulation and ask..." Or, for example, I really appreciate some of the technical mentorship. Yeah, cool. But he doesn't have a lot of time so it's like I really want to ask him this questions. How do you respond with simulated environments like this would be really cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:37):
That's a great place to plug Lennybot, have one of those. It's trained on all of my podcasts and newsletters. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:42):
Oh, cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):
It sits on many models. I don't know which exactly they use, but it's exactly that. And it's not even me, it's all the guests that have been on the podcast and on newsletter as I wrote. And you could just ask it, "How do I grow my product? How do I develop a strategy?" And it's actually shockingly good.

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Do you feel like it reflects who you are?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
Yeah. 

Karina Nguyen (01:03:58):
Or would it be... Okay. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):
The best part of it is you can talk to it. There's an ElevenLabs voice version that's trained on my voice from this podcast, and it's actually very good and people have told me they sit there for hours talking to it. 

Karina Nguyen (01:04:15):
Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):
And somebody told it, "Interview me like I am on Lenny's podcast, ask me questions about my career." And he did a half hour podcast episode with Lennybot.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:24):
Oh my god, that's so fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:27):
It's incredible. Future is wild.

Karina Nguyen (01:04:29):
Yeah. I think content transformation is... I would imagine sometime when you generate a sci-fi story in Canvas, you can transform this into audiobook where you have very natural content transformation of one media to another media. I think one of my earliest inspiration is one of the last episodes of Westworld where, I don't want to spoil, but where Dolores comes to her work at that time and she comes to this new workspace and she starts writing a story. And then as she writes a story, a 3D, virtual reality, starts creating on the fly. So I kind of want to create that. Kind of cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):
Wow. Speaking of medium, I guess I was wondering if I should go in this direct or not, but real quick. Kevin Weill/Kevin Weill, I don't know exactly how to pronounce his last name, the CPO of OpenAI.

Karina Nguyen (01:05:35):
Kevin Weill, uh-huh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:37):
Is it Weill or Weill? 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:37):
I think Weill. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:39):
Weill. Okay. Okay. Let's just say that. We'll go with that. 

Karina Nguyen (01:05:40):
I hope, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):
He did a panel at the Lenny and Friends Summit last year and he made this really fascinating point that chat is a really interesting interface for these tools because they're just getting smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter. And chat continues to work as a paradigm to just interact with them, similar to a human. You could talk to Albert Einstein. You could talk to someone not very smart and it's all conversation still. And so it's a really flexible way to interact with increasingly good intelligence. At some point it'll not be so great, and you were talking about all these ways that you're adding additional ways to interact. But it's interesting chat proved to be a really powerful layer on top of all this stuff. 

Karina Nguyen (01:06:22):
Yeah, that's real cool. I feel like chat also has social element which is very humane. It's like, yeah, you sometimes want to get into group chat. And having conversations with AI is kind of like a group chat in itself, as messaging. Actually, this idea of how do you build features like this? I see tasks as this general feature that will scale very nicely as the models would develop new capabilities themselves. The models will be able to do better searches and create new... come up with more creative writing on render, react apps and like HTML apps. And you can have everyday new puzzle for you, every day continue the story from the previous days. It scales very nicely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:14):
You mentioned something as we were getting into this extra section that we ended up going down is this idea of the agents using a computer. I know this is actually something you are going to launch today, the day we're recording it, which will be out by the time this comes out, called Operator, can you talk about this very cool feature that people will have access to?

Karina Nguyen (01:07:33):
Yeah, so I unfortunately did not work on that, but I'm really, really excited about this launch. It's basically an agent that can complete the task in its own virtual computer, in its own virtual environment. You can do any literally task like order me a book on Amazon. And then ideally the model will either follow up with you which book do you want, or know you so well that it start recommending, "Oh, here is the five books that I might recommend you to buy." And then you hit, "Yeah, help me buy." And then the model goes off into its own virtual little browser and complete the task and buy the book on the Amazon. And then if you give the model credentials, credit cards, obviously it comes with a lot of trust and safety, then it will just complete the thing for you. It's a virtual assistant.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:37):
It's interesting how this just sounds like obviously this should happen. Why is this not yet a thing? Which is also mind-blowing that we're just assuming this should exist. Just some AI doing things for you on a computer we just ask it to do. 

Karina Nguyen (01:08:37):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):
It's absurd.

Karina Nguyen (01:08:51):
It's actually really hard. And I think you're still cracking this, but feel like... I don't know if you use Tuple like a pair programming product.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):
No.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:04):
But at Anthropic we loved pair programming, so if you used-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):
Oh yeah, Shopify uses this. I remember it came up on a podcast episode.

Karina Nguyen (01:09:10):
Oh, nice. Yeah, so it is a very cool product where you can just call anyone at any time and then share screen and the other person can have access to the screen or start literally operating your computer. And it's very realtime... The allegiance is very... it's very high quality. And it's just like I kind of want the same. I want to pair program with my model and the model should even talk to me. Draw very specific section in my code and just go to tell me... Obviously teach me and we can have different modes. It's like right, this is a product right here for you. I don't know. Some people should build that. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:58):
It sounds like a startup just got birthed-

Karina Nguyen (01:09:59):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):
... from someone listening to this. You mentioned that it's very hard to do this agent controlling a computer as you and helping out. What makes it so hard for whatever, however much you can explain briefly?

Karina Nguyen (01:10:11):
Much of it is because right now the model's operating on pixels instead of language or whatnot. Pixels is actually really, really hard. The models [inaudible 01:10:25] perception, or visual perception. I think there's still a lot of multimodal research that's going on, but I think language scaled so much easier compared to multimodal because of that.

(01:10:38):
Another thing that I guess my team is working that is how do you derive human intent very correctly? It's like sometimes does the model know enough information to ask a follow-up question or to complete the task? You don't want an agent to go off for 10 minutes and then come back with an answer that you didn't even want. That actually creates much more worse user experience. And this comes with teaching the model people skills. It's like, "What do people like? Kind of like creating the mental model of the user and care about the user in order to ask certain questions. Actually, that part is hard to do for the models.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
That relates to what we talked about earlier where this kind of the soft skill, people skills piece is not where these models are strong yet.

Karina Nguyen (01:11:34):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):
Okay. I'm going to skip the lightning round. I want to ask just one question from the lightning round, something fun. 

Karina Nguyen (01:11:41):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):
Okay, so when AI replaces your job, Karina, I'm curious what you're... And it gives you a stipend, gives you a monthly stipend. Here's your salary for the month. What would you want to do? What do you want to spend your time on? What will you be doing in this future world?

Karina Nguyen (01:11:57):
I've been thinking about this a lot times. I feel like I have a lot of jobs options. I would love to be a writer, I think. I think that would be super cool. You should write short stories, sci-fi stories, novels. I really like art history, so you know those conservationists in the museums who just try to preserve art paintings, but just painting through a long day? 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:28):
Mm-hmm. 

Karina Nguyen (01:12:29):
I think that would be really cool to do. Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):
That sounds beautiful.

Karina Nguyen (01:12:36):
I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
What I'm hearing is you need to Nerf these models to not get very good at writing so that you can continue... Although at that point you don't need to do it from... You don't need people to buy it, you're just doing it for fun, so it doesn't even matter if they're incredibly good at writing or art conservation. Oh man, what an episode of our conversation. What a wild time we're living in. Karina, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:06):
You can find me, I'm on Twitter it's KarinaNguyen. You can also shoot me an email on my website. And my team is hiring and so I'm looking for research engineers, research scientists, as well as machine learning engineers, people who come from product engineers who want to learn model training. I'm actually hiring for my team. My team is called Frontier Product Research, and we train models, we develop new methods but for product oriented outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):
What a place to work. Holy moly. What's the best way for people to apply for these very lucrative roles?

Karina Nguyen (01:13:46):
I think you can shoot me a DM on Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):
Okay. 

Karina Nguyen (01:13:51):
Or I'm yet to create a job description for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:51):
Okay. This is the job description.

Karina Nguyen (01:13:58):
Or you can apply into post training team. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):
Okay. You're going to get a flood of DMs. I hope you're prepared. Karina, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Karina Nguyen (01:14:03):
Thank you so much, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):
Bye, everyone. 

Karina Nguyen (01:14:05):
It was fun.

# Building beautiful products with Stripe’s Head of Design | Katie Dill (Stripe, Airbnb, Lyft)

## Transcript

Katie Dill (00:00:00):
The use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased, like pretty dramatically. And it's aligned with this idea of, "Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters." As if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. No, they're not two opposite things. Functionality is important. And actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use.

(00:00:32):
And the other piece of it that is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. Things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this, and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Today my guest is Katie Dill. Katie is Head of Design at Stripe, where she oversees product design, brand and marketing creative, web presence, user research, content strategy, and design ops. Katie was previously Head of Design at Lyft, and Head of Experience Design at Airbnb. She's built and led design teams at three different hypergrowth companies, seen the teams scale at least 10x, and two of which, Airbnb and Stripe, are some of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world and also the best designed products.

(00:01:25):
In our conversation Katie shares stories of trials and tribulations of leading large design teams, processes she's put in place for operationalizing quality, how she thinks about quality and beauty very practically, how design can directly lead to growth, and examples of this that led to a big lift in conversion at Stripe, plus a math formula she uses to increase team performance, how she suggests organizing your design and product teams, what to look for in design hires, and so much more. I was really lucky to get to work with Katie while at Airbnb, and I am so excited to have her on this podcast. With that, I bring you Katie Dill after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:05):
This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.

(00:02:29):
This has been a big trajectory changer for me. But it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly-vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.

(00:02:53):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

Katie Dill (00:04:52):
Thanks for having me. Good to be here.

Lenny (00:04:54):
It's absolutely my pleasure. So as we were preparing for this podcast, you hinted at a story that you had from your time at Airbnb where the design team staged an intervention with you which I had no idea about. Because I was there during this time and I did not know this was happening. I am so curious to hear the story. Can you share what happened?

Katie Dill (00:05:15):
Ah, starting with the easy questions I see. All right.

Lenny (00:05:18):
Right into it.

Katie Dill (00:05:20):
Yeah. No, I'm happy to talk about it because, frankly, it was the biggest learning experience of my leadership career, or at least that happened in one moment. It happened in my early days at Airbnb. I was hired to take on the Design Organization, or the Experience Design Organization. That's basically the Product Design team, which was 10 people at the time. They had been reporting directly to one of the founders and they were going to start reporting to me.

(00:05:47):
During my interview process I learned a lot about what was working, and what wasn't working, and some of the trials and tribulations with the Design Organization and its collaboration with others. So it seemed like there was room for improvement in how Engineering, and Product Management, and Design all worked together. There was also really low engagement scores in the Design team.

(00:06:08):
So I kind of came in ready to go and excited to try to help make some change based on all the things that I had learned from various leaders and people across the company. I came in swinging, ready to go. And then about a month into my time there, I got a meeting on my calendar, Thursday 8:30 AM, it was an hour and a half with half of the Design team, so that was five people, and our HR partner.

Lenny (00:06:38):
Oh, no.

Katie Dill (00:06:38):
Usually not a good sign.

Lenny (00:06:38):
That's never a good sign.

Katie Dill (00:06:40):
Yeah. And I remember this so vividly. I remember walking into the office, and all the rooms in Airbnb's office are very unique spaces that look like Airbnb's. But of course this was the one room with all white walls and just a gray flat rectangle table. I walked into the room and there were five of them seated around the table. They had a pack of papers in front of them and they went on taking turns quietly reading from the papers all the things that they saw that I was doing wrong and all the things that they didn't like about me.

(00:07:22):
It was a really hard moment there. I went through all the usual kind of like stages of grief when one hears feedback, which is just like an immediate want to respond to be like, "Yeah." Like, "Well there was a good reason for that." And like, "That's not how it actually was." And, "This is why I did that." But luckily, thank goodness I had the sense to just listen and not respond in that way. I mean, clearly what they were telling me is that that was one of the things that was missing.

(00:07:49):
So I heard them out and took it all in. And regardless of each individual saying, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that, is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was, is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me. They had no idea that they could trust in what I was trying to build, and what I was trying to shape, and that I cared about them, and that I had their best interests and shared goals at heart. And that was absolutely my fault.

(00:08:24):
In retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that. So it was an extremely valuable learning experience. I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them.

(00:08:57):
So I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me. You can inflict change on people, but if you want to do it with them trust is the key element there. And then a couple months later, we had the best engagement scores in the company.

(00:09:20):
So it did objectively improve the situation, and since then taken that on into next steps in other companies that I've joined. And just think about instead of coming in swinging, come in listening, so that you can really set out to make change that actually has true, positive impact on the folks around you and that you bring along with you.

Lenny (00:09:42):
Wow, I was there during this. I did not know this was happening. Is this the time when all the designers were all always in one room together in Thayer? Is that that period?

Katie Dill (00:09:52):
Before I got there I think there was a little of like, "Design is just going to sit with Design and not necessarily work in close proximity with engineers and product managers, et cetera." And one of the things that I believe as a necessary part of building a high-functioning organization is that, one, building together is important. So having engineers, and product managers, and designers be together, have shared goals, and align on that and be able to just look over each other's shoulder and talk about things, is important. So sitting together is important.

(00:10:21):
However, that Thayer thing that you're talking about actually was like something that I was very devoted to, which is bringing Design together at key moments multiple times throughout the week to also build a community in Design. Like Joebot at Airbnb once said, "It's like, well, what T-shirt do you wear? What team are you on?" And I was like, "You have two T-shirts. You have the Design T-shirt and you have the Marketplace T-shirt, or whatever cross-disciplinary team that you work on. Because both are really important communities to build for slightly different reasons." So yeah, Thayer was a good spot for that.

Lenny (00:10:56):
Zooming out a little bit, I think the elephant in the room a lot of times with design is this idea that I'd say most PMs, most founders, intellectually understand the value of design, understand the value of high quality. But day-to-day it's often not actually prioritized versus new features, new product launches, partly because the ROI is just really unclear.

(00:11:16):
If we spend another month making this more awesome and making this even more amazing design-wise, experience-wise, what is that going to get us? Clearly, at Airbnb design was highly prioritized. At Stripe, from an outsider's perspective, it clearly is. I'm just curious what you've learned about how to make the case for the ROI of design and just how Stripe, and Airbnb, and Lyft have done that.

Katie Dill (00:11:39):
It's a great question, and I think this is like an age-old question that I don't know if will ever go away, and probably because the quality bar keeps evolving, keeps rising. But I think first to kind of level set before we dive into that I would say that there are levels of quality. There is the, does the thing work? Does it provide some sort of value proposition? It like executes on its job. That's baseline quality.

(00:12:06):
Next is that, does it do it exceedingly well? Is it error-free? Actually, maybe that's not even exceedingly well but just error-free and it actually works in a well-rounded way. Then beyond that, like level three, level four, level five, does it exceed expectations and it does something that you weren't even seeking for as a user? And I do think the levels of quality should be based on user expectations. I don't believe that there are disciplines that just don't care about quality.

(00:12:36):
I think it's more about that prioritization and kind of like what you talked about is just like, is it really worth getting something to that exceedingly well state or is it, what about just like another feature and being seduced by the chase of another feature versus actually taking your features to a level of being great? That is hard. And I get it when you look at your user base and they're all shouting from the rooftops for this additional feature.

(00:13:05):
Of course you're going to want to prioritize that over something they never asked for. Then the other thing would be you end up with like you've got three things that you could possibly do to make perhaps the next stage in your product development. Two of them you know you can measure and they're going to line up to business goals, and one of them you can't.

(00:13:21):
Of course that's going to be enchanting to want to go after the things that you can actually measure, you know that they're going to have that impact. But the companies that know that quality is non-negotiable, it is a long-term necessary aspect of what they build, don't play that numbers game. Or what they do is they recognize that it is absolutely functionality, but the quality of those features that is actually going to get to great usability, desirability in their product.

(00:13:53):
Actually, I think it's kind of like an analogy for going to the gym or working out. I don't know about you, but literally every time I think to do this, there's a fight in my head of like, "Ah, do I really need to work out today? Is this one day going to give me six-pack abs?" Like, "Of course not." So like, "Why go? Why not just skip it today?" But of course then at some point, hopefully, I realize that it's like, "Well, if I skip it today, what's to stop me from skipping it another day?"

(00:14:21):
And really in the belief of that these things, it really does add up to a better outcome in the end, and so a longer, healthier life. So hopefully I can get myself together and go to the gym. I do think some of the best companies on the planet think that way. I recognize that customers don't always ask for it. I mean, you might see it in support cases for example. Like clearly they don't know how to use this next step and that is probably a quality issue and that they might be asking for in more improved features.

(00:14:53):
But some of the levels of quality, the level two, and three, and four, you might not get direct asked for. But I guess I'll give you another analogy. If you don't have competition, that's fine. Right? If you think about the first car, I am sure that wheel was really hard to turn, and I'm sure that seat was not comfortable, and you could have any color you want as long as it's black. Right? But there was no competition. The competition was a horse, so no big deal. For cars today it's like the stitching, the choice of the leather, the sound of the door.

(00:15:28):
These distinguish a, hmm, okay car to a high-end special car with higher value. This is very much by understanding how the details matter and how execution of quality will take it to the next level. Lastly, I'll just say that I know there's this saying of it's growth versus quality, but quality is growth. And if you think about how you can make your product easier to use and more understandable, that will of course drive people to use it, and use more of it, and have a better experience with it that they'll want to talk about with others.

(00:16:08):
In fact, at Stripe our Growth team I would say is pretty much maniacally focused on building better experiences because we've seen it tied directly to our business metrics. We have things that we've improved on in our onboarding flow, for example, to make it easier to understand the products, understand how they work for your different use cases such that then we have seen activations increase because we've made these quality improvements that are just directly tied to growth.

(00:16:38):
One of the biggest examples that I've seen of business impact through quality is actually in the checkout experience. We've done research on the checkout experience in some of the top e-commerce sites. We found that 99% of the top e-commerce sites have errors in their checkout flow that actually hinder more impactful, more seamless, quicker checkout, and therefore higher conversion with their customers. These small things, really they're quality issues.

(00:17:14):
They're just that if you really understand what a consumer is trying to get out of the experience, then you can make it better. So we have been maniacally focused on that over many years, trying to make the checkout experience so much better for businesses and their consumers. So by improving the quality of the checkout experience through details small and large, we have seen a 10.5% increase in business' revenue from an older form of checkout to a newer form of checkout. And those little details matter to have such a material impact on one's revenue.

Lenny (00:17:51):
You mentioned this before we started recording, but you guys power the checkout flow for some very big sites. Can you mention a few of these because they'll give people a sense of like holy moly.

Katie Dill (00:18:00):
Yeah. Stripe is used by millions of businesses globally, small and large, from early stage startups, to SMBs, larger organizations and enterprises like Amazon and Hertz, Shopify, Spotify, X, which I believe you use. The work that we do, it ranges.

(00:18:20):
We have checkout flows, so when someone's paying online, or in person, or we also provide a suite of financial automation tools so that you can run your subscriptions business, and recognize your revenue, and receive tax, and essentially manage the complexity of the financial space through powerful tools that hope to make your job easier so you don't have to sweat the details of how these things work.

Lenny (00:18:46):
I just want to follow this thread a little bit. You talked about these opportunities to improve the checkout flow through a design lens. You could also think of it from like as a product manager I'd be like, "Oh wow. Let's just find all the things that people get stuck on and fix them." How is it that you see that from the quality design perspective versus like, "Oh, let's just move this metric and here's all the things that are stopping people." What would you say is the designer's lens on that, if there's anything there?

Katie Dill (00:19:13):
Honestly, a pet peeve of mine is this way of talking about things as there's business goals and there's design goals. Because I think maybe the first conversation one should have is that, "What are we trying to build towards?" And I would think that folks that want to create really impactful products, they want to create quality products, and that they want to create things that actually serve their customers in a positive and beneficial way because they know that will build a stronger business in the long run.

(00:19:47):
So yes, there may be slight prioritization details different through the process where a designer might be thinking more about the emotional experience and how somebody feels, because that's oftentimes how they're wired, and that is an important lens to bring on it. Whereas somebody else might just be like, "Well, just make the button bigger and they'll click it more often, and that's the outcome that we seek."

(00:20:10):
So this is, again, why I was talking about how important it is to have multidisciplinary teams that work closely together because sometimes we are the checks and balances in the conversation. But I do think if we can align on what are we trying to build? Are we trying to build something great, then we can recognize the fact that it isn't just that utility is an incredible important part of that, but so is usability and so is desirability because these things together make something truly great.

(00:20:38):
So beauty is an important part of that because it does make things more useful, it does make things more accessible, and that with these things kind of coming together you can build towards something better. I think that beauty on its own or just craft on its own without utility, I mean that's like, I don't know, that's like Blu-ray or PATH. Right? That does not lead to a high-quality product. So it is the combination of these things, and so it's like stepping towards that.

(00:21:10):
But if you really want your product, those features, to be utilized for all that they're worth and to actually gain such esteem, and respect, and reuse, taking it to that next level and thinking about, "How do I make this actually an enjoyable use and that it really feels like it's meant for me and it maps my mental model," that craft and that quality of the execution of those details is going to be paramount.

Lenny (00:21:40):
You mentioned this word beauty, and I wanted to follow on this a little bit of just ... This is a big question, but just what is great design? What is beauty? Is there like a objective definition where if a designer is like, "This is great design," is there just like, "Yes, that is true." Or is it just an opinion? How do you think about what is great design? What is beauty, Katie Dill?

Katie Dill (00:21:59):
I love that we're talking about this because I feel like there's probably some people listening that are squirming in their seats. Of like, "Beauty? We're talking about business here." Which is great. Actually, there's a fun fact. Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh have a book called Beauty. I would highly recommend it. Very, very worth the read. But one of the first things they talk about in the book is that from the 1800s to the 2000s the use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased pretty dramatically.

(00:22:34):
It's aligned with this idea of like, "Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters," as if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. But what the whole book talks about is that like, "No, they're not two opposite things." Functionality is important, and actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use. And there is actually some objectivity to whether or not beauty enhances things.

(00:23:05):
But if you ask a wide audience what color do they like more or what version of things do they like more, they tend to say the same thing because there is this shared understanding. The other piece of it that yes I can imagine is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. A good example of how something looks, and how something is structured, and how that can translate to that, also from the book Beauty, they mentioned that they studied the tweets that came from people that were traveling through Penn Station versus Grand Central.

(00:23:43):
If you've been to those places I'm sure where I'm going with this, which is just like the people tweeting from Penn Station, it was just like more negative than the people that were tweeting from Grand Central Station that tended to be much more positive and optimistic. So the things that you create have this impact. And if you're thinking about like, "I want people to enjoy using my-

Katie Dill (00:24:00):
... have this impact. If you're thinking about, "I want people to enjoy using my product, I want them to feel at home in our product." Of course, beauty is a part of it, and this matters deeply to us, and I know, as a financial infrastructure company in the B2B space, some may assume that that doesn't matter as much, but it's actually a key priority for us. Because, number one, things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.

(00:24:37):
Then, secondly, it is easier to use, as I've mentioned, it gives better user outcomes. What we're trying to do is we're trying to equip businesses to make the right decisions to be more successful at what they do. By bringing a interface or our invoices, or whatever it might be, to be more beautiful, and more easy to use, and more trustworthy, that will lead them to better outcomes. Thirdly, I strongly believe beauty begets beauty. When our business users or the consumers see the beauty and the care and the creativity that we put into things we deliver, then that again reassures them of just the care that we put into them. Actually, a perfect example of this, have you seen the show The Bear?

Lenny (00:25:23):
I have, yes. Great example. Yeah.

Katie Dill (00:25:25):
All right. Okay. All right. No spoilers, but all I have to say is peeling mushrooms. Do you know what I mean?

Lenny (00:25:30):
Yeah.

Katie Dill (00:25:30):
Yeah. Such a good example. Such a good example.

Lenny (00:25:33):
Someone just mentioned that same episode on a recent podcast episode.

Katie Dill (00:25:36):
Okay. All right. Well, it's that good. It's that good. I wish I could remember which episode that was, but it was seven? I forget. But anyway.

Lenny (00:25:44):
Yeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right.

Katie Dill (00:25:45):
Oh, nice. Okay. All right. Well, and then lastly, quality is a matter of pride, beauty is a matter of pride. If we put that care into our work, more people will want to work with us, because they want to see their time spent and the care for their craft recognized and utilized and see that that can be put together into something really impactful. We really put that on the pedestal, because we know how much it matters to our users and then how much it matters to the people that work with us. Beauty is an important part of it all.

Lenny (00:26:20):
Amazing. Speaking of beauty, when I think of Stripe and beautiful, I think of your website, and some of the specific landing pages you have, which are just incredibly nice. I'm just curious how you decide it's time to redesign your website and how much time and thought you put into a new website. Because that feels like a common question founders have, "Should we redo our website?" And it feels like you guys really think deeply about that. So, I guess is there anything there that you can share?

Katie Dill (00:26:45):
Yeah, there's definitely a couple of things we could talk about in terms of operationalizing quality. Because the gravitational pull is to mediocrity. It is very easy to fall into a path of a baseline, where what is required to go to that next level where something feels truly great is certainly a lot of effort, and it's a concerted effort. I will definitely say we are a work in progress and we have not nailed all the things and it is an ongoing pursuit of excellence.

(00:27:21):
The way that we build the website is that we certainly do put a lot of care into what we're putting out into the world, and we view it as a articulation of how we care about our users in all that we provide for them. So, we take that very seriously. We try to meld art and science. So, it's the creativity of the work, but it's also just the technical power of the way that we show it.

(00:27:49):
How we've actually operationalized the way we do that is that we have design and engineering and our product partners and product marketing work really, really closely on this. Actually, it's one of the few teams where all of these things report, well, not all of them, but most of those functions report into one place. So, engineering and design actually all report up into the design organization when they work on the website. Together, quite literally, as we were talking about earlier, if we were physically together, they would be sitting side by side and they're batting ideas back and forth, because the engineer on the team has a great idea for how we could go about executing on it. And the designer on the team has another idea how to push that a little further. So, that rapid cycle of iteration is really, really powerful, especially when we're trying to move quickly, but at an extremely high standard.

Lenny (00:28:44):
That's super interesting. Is there anything else that you've found to be really helpful in just operationalizing great design, craft, beauty, any processes, systems, frameworks?

Katie Dill (00:28:54):
Yeah, I would love to tell you about something that we've actually rolled out pretty recently that I'm extremely excited about the positive impact on.

Lenny (00:29:02):
Awesome.

Katie Dill (00:29:02):
But before I get into that, one of the things that has been driving a little bit of this process and the way that I've been thinking about how we can build better things at Stripe is actually I've been just talking to people, talking to different design leaders, product leaders, engineer leaders at different organizations and trying to understand how they go about it. There are a couple of themes that are clearly coming through.

(00:29:28):
Number one is that quality is definitely a group effort. You're sunk if you think that you can just hire some incredibly talented person and they'll do it, that'll be fine. The rest of us will do what we're doing and they'll do it, or that it's just one organization that's going to look out for quality or QA is going to solve it all for you. It really does need to be an organizational and a group effort. If you think about the way that you run the internal functions is going to show up in the outside and how clear you all are and how you're talking about it and the standards that you set inside and you're constantly reminding people of in the way that you communicate inside will then eventually show up outside. So, of course, keeping your talent bar high and then thinking about how those things really need to be cared for, that shared care across the organization is number one.

(00:30:20):
Number two is that there needs to be some amount of vision and alignment. So, if you hire all the best people in the world and you just set them out to go and do their thing, what are the chances that they're all going to end up with something that actually aligns pretty well? Even if they all have incredible taste and they're very good at what they do, there is subjectivity to every decision in some part. So, that they might end up with some things that are really great but don't fit together as a really nice whole.

(00:30:49):
The perfect example would be building a house. You have the person that works on the roof and the person that works on the deck and the person that does the siding, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A house is arguably far less complex than most of the technical products that we all know. Yet, there is painstaking effort put into having the plans and having a drawing of what the final thing is going to look like. There's a GC, there's an architect. And these people are helping to make sure that all those pieces fit together, and we should have that same care when we're trying to build products together.

(00:31:19):
I think a big pair on that is then the next piece, which is editing. And you might call that your GC or your architect or somebody that sees how all these things fit together, and then has an ability to help narrow and reduce and remove the things that don't fit. At Airbnb, Brian Chesky is the editor of all the things that come together. At the Economist, there's a chief editor. But other organizations, they might decentralize that approach, which is certainly possible, but challenging, because you do need somebody to help see these things come together.

(00:31:53):
That pairs with the next piece, which is about courage, the ability to actually say, "No, this isn't good enough." To have the resolve to just be like, "Almost, but no." Which is one of the hardest decisions I think leaders can make and certainly I've had to ever make in my career, too, is just a team puts all this care and effort into something and then you're going to say, "Actually, unfortunately we're just not there yet. Let's try again." That is, I think, incredibly important part of getting there and building the fitness of what you do.

(00:32:28):
Then, lastly, the thing that I've learned that will lead me to the example that you were asking about is that, in order to build quality, you really do need to understand it also from the user perspective, which gets me into my fixation with journeys, because that is how a user sees it. The user very, very, very rarely just deals with any aspect of what you build in isolation. There has to be a moment where they learn about it. There has to be a moment where they get to know it, and then there's a moment where they actually decide to use it, and then something just changed and now they need to use that product in some other way. You have to understand it from that point of view to really understand whether or not the quality is there. I think that's a critical piece of building teams that have empathy for their users.

(00:33:16):
So, we have been operationalizing that. All the things that I just mentioned, but one of the key pieces is to bring that approach to understanding the quality of the product. So, our goal was to set out to try to solve the fact that products can be shipped and they could be at their highest game when you ship them, they go through all the processes internally to be a high quality thing, and then it gets out into the world and then, over time, the quality regresses. Some of the reasons for that is that other things are being shipped. It's kind of like, again, back to an analogy of a house, imagine you have one room where you redo the molding and you paint the little aspects and you've put new plates on the lights, now all of a sudden that room is great, but it makes everything else look worse and the whole composite is worse.

(00:34:10):
That is something that can happen to products is actually they get worse over time. Then you organize a company oftentimes and parts to be able to focus on their key business areas. That's a very good thing because they get focused and they know what they're building towards and they get expertise and they're laser focused on that. So, ideally, they move faster. But what also happens is that they get so focused on that they forget about that piece of the journey, and how it all fits together, and not recognizing that part of their product experience is intimately tied to another.

(00:34:44):
So, what we did was we set out to, number one, increase the kind of awareness and accountability of leaders to own their journeys. What we have established are we started with 15 of our most important user journeys. 15 is somewhat of an arbitrary number. It's a number that we can kind of keep track of, but also has pretty good breadth, but is certainly not comprehensive of all the most important things. But 15 of our critical user journeys, the things that we know matter so deeply to our users, and we must get right at the highest level of quality possible.

(00:35:20):
Those 15 things then each have engineering, product and design leaders that are responsible for the quality of those products. They review these journeys, what we call walk the store, where they review them as if they're walking the floor of their store on a regular cadence, and they friction log what they experience, which I know David Singleton talked about on your podcast. They will write what they have seen, what's working, what's not working. They're viewing this from, they're trying to put themselves in the shoes of their user. This of course doesn't replace user research, but it substitutes it and it adds to that.

(00:35:58):
So, they go through the experience and noting what's working and what's not working. And very critically, it's a journey, so a lot of times it starts from internet search, it starts on Google trying to understand something, goes to the website, they end up on Docs, they end up in the dashboard, and they're seeing it as a user might. With that, they're able to find the entailments of the experience that may or may not be working. They jot that down, they file bugs, they reach out to the teams that may own the different parts of this experience, and then they score it. Then on, again, a regular cadence, we come together in almost like a calibration, where we meet and we talk about the score of their work.

(00:36:40):
It relates to performance reviews. Performance reviews, managers are assessing an individual's performance, which is hard. There's some subjectivity to it, just like understanding quality can be. But what we do as managers is we calibrate. We come together and we talk about, "Okay, how well is our interpretation of our ladders document? And how well does that performance align? And are we doing it consistently across the rest of the organization?" So, we do something very similar. We calibrate these scores because what we're really trying to do is not just the 15 essential journeys and the owners of those, we want to actually uplevel and bring more shared understanding of our quality bar across the company. These moments of calibration start that. Then having leaders do this creates this, number one, it cascades this idea of the importance of owning your journey and then also has upstream impact.

(00:37:43):
Because when people see the state of products in the wild as a user would, they learn a lot about what are some of the bigger opportunities that we can make to make the product better? What are some of the things that maybe we want to change in our process to make sure that we have even better things coming into the wild? One of the best parts of this is, since then we've learned that folks have seen that like, "Oh my goodness, our SEO for this particular product or the way we're articulating it doesn't align to actually how we want people to understand it later on in the journey. So if we improve this over here, we're going to improve outcomes later on." They're seeing that and they're now able to make that happen even faster to make some of the changes there.

(00:38:27):
Then my real favorite part is that we're hearing from folks that maybe at first didn't see this as necessary, that maybe in different functions that are just like, "Oh, I was so very focused on executing the technical ability of what I do on this thing, but I hadn't seen it from this lens before." Now there're actually converts of like, "Yes, this is a really important part of it." That goes back to the point of it's a group effort. You don't want just one function looking out for the quality of the product. So, having engineers and product managers and people of different disciplines walking the store, seeing the experience, feeling it firsthand, I think will lead to better care in all of the details that will aligned to better craft in the end.

Lenny (00:39:12):
Oh man, what an awesome process. I have a million questions I want to ask to better understand how you operationalize this. I'll try to ask just a few. But one thing that stood out about this process is I think people kind of don't trust their own judgment when they're looking at their own product. They kind of, especially product managers, almost have to feel like they have to rely on user research or data to know a thing versus like, "I just see this and it feels bad to me." I think I've learned over time more and more that you should really trust that, because you're spending your energy trying to use this thing, you're not that different from a potential user. So, I love that this actually relies on your personal judgment trying to use a thing, which I think people undervalue.

Katie Dill (00:39:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:39:54):
A couple of just very tactical questions, how often roughly does this happen? Is it once a quarter?

Katie Dill (00:40:00):
To your first point, 100%, they're all just forms of input. I'm definitely not saying do this instead of user research, do this instead of data. It's like these things in additional sense. I do think what's so powerful about doing it firsthand is that, although I am the biggest supporter of user research, even hearing somebody talk about an experience, while that is really, really powerful, feeling the pain firsthand is just this next level of visceral understanding of like, "Oh, this could be better." Your users, they might not always say what's missing or what's wrong, or maybe they don't know that certain aspects of it could be better. Yeah, having your point of view on that in addition to the user research and what you've heard from them directly is really, really important.

(00:40:49):
But you asked about how often. We have, as I've mentioned, we are constantly looking at our processes and trying to figure out how we can make them better and better as an organization, as we've grown, things need to adjust. We today are doing it quarterly. The quarterly aspect of walking the stores by no means meant to be like that's the only time people do it. But that is the time where we're looking for update your scorecard and share the information in a dashboard where everybody can see. That is feeling right now to be the right cadence because that's enough time that there can be material differences made. You can see the scores evolve over time. But also frequently enough that you're not missing that perhaps there's been a setback since. But, of course, my real hope is that they're happening weekly, just perhaps in different parts of the organization.

Lenny (00:41:46):
I want to ask a couple more questions so that folks can try this at home. I was just thinking this podcast is the opposite of don't try this at home. It's like, "Here, try this at home?"

Katie Dill (00:41:54):
Try it at home.

Lenny (00:41:55):
Yeah. So, I want to try to give people a few more answers to questions when they're probably going to try to do this themselves. Who's in these meetings? Do you join these walkthroughs? Does David join? What do you suggest there?

Katie Dill (00:42:07):
Yeah. For what we're doing for each team is they do them themselves together. At bare minimum, it should be the engineer, product manager and designer doing it together. The reason why we like to see it happen together is, again, as we've talked about before, is that people bring a different perspective to something. Let's say somebody in the room might be like, "Oh my goodness, the load time didn't feel really good there." And like, "Oh, whoa, the way we're stating this is not consistent per page. And that's not on our design system."

(00:42:41):
So, it is really powerful to have folks come together and do it. In fact, David Singleton, who you mentioned, he and I do these things very regularly, too. This is outside the essential journeys program, but he and I walk the store and we'll just pick random flows and go through it together. I can't code, but he can. So, he'll do the code part and I'll be sitting there being, "What? Do they really do that? How can we make that better for them?"

(00:43:08):
I really love the multidisciplinary approach, but then when we do the calibration after the team has done these walkthroughs and they've gotten their own perspective and they fill out the scorecard based on our rubric for quality, we will come together in what we call PQR, product quality review. And they will take us through what they have experienced, and then they'll talk about, "So, this is why we've scored this, a yellow or a yellow green." Then we might have a conversation about that.

(00:43:39):
It's like, "Well, actually, that felt a little worse than you've described it. Actually, I think that we probably need to put more urgency on solving that." Or in some cases it's like, "Actually, that was pretty great. If you think about what we're trying to help somebody achieve at this moment that actually is really hitting the mark."

(00:43:59):
We will debate that there. In those meetings you'll have, yes, myself, David Singleton, Will Gaybrick, who leads product and business, and then various leaders from the organization that might be relevant to that area. We are trying to give people insight to what's happening across. Again, it's a multidisciplinary room. I'm trying to keep it not too large, because obviously it can be hard to have discussion, but it is very valuable to make sure, again, that we have the perspective of product marketing and the perspective of engineering, the expected product in the room as we discuss what our quality bar is.

Lenny (00:44:36):
Awesome. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. In terms of scoring, are you scoring individual steps of these journeys or is it yellow for segments? What are you scoring?

Katie Dill (00:44:44):
The way the rubric works is so that, and we have a template for the friction log. So, people fill out a friction log and it'll be screenshots and then what they experienced. Then there is a tool to tag for each moment. It's like, "Oh, that was a nice touch." Or, "Ooh, that is not great. We should consider a fix." Or different levels of severity of like, "Oh my gosh, P0 bug, we need to fix this right now." So, they'll tag for different moments in the journey.

(00:45:11):
Then there is a summary score at the end, which is based on a rubric that we have that talks about the importance of quality from the point of view of usability, utility, desirability, and actually going to that next level of surprisingly great. Then we'll ask them to score on a whole what they felt of these things. Then that adds up to a summary score. Which we have also talked about the different ways of scoring. Is it a number-based system? Is it a letter-based system? Like A-minus and B?

Lenny (00:45:42):
[inaudible 00:45:42].

Katie Dill (00:45:42):
Yeah. So far we have landed on a color system because, honestly, I think people can get a little tied around the axle on how you're measuring it, and to your point, especially in subjective things, and it's just like, "Oh, it's like, well, is it really a six or is it a seven?" We didn't want people to get a little too worried about how does... It's not meant to be an objective quantitative score. It is qualitative, it is judgment. We hire people for judgment, so we want them to bring that to the conversation. That's how we chose the score, because we felt that would actually lead to quicker but straightforward opinions and decisions.

Lenny (00:46:25):
At a lot of companies, you have these reviews and the founders share all this like, "Oh, this is broken, this is busted." And as a product team, you're like, "Goddammit, we have these goals we got to hit. We have this roadmap. And now we're going to get a hundred things that the founder's like, 'Got to fix this.'" I'm curious just how you tell teams to take this stuff and prioritize it amongst all the other things they're going to do. Is it just up to them, is they're like, "Need to fix this"? Anything you can share there, but just how to actually operationalize taking this feedback and doing something with it?

Katie Dill (00:46:54):
Yes. Yeah. I've seen some organizations talk about when they're doing planning, you do your OKRs quarterly or half year or year, whatever, recommendations of like, 10% of your time should be spent on fixing things, and 20% on growing things, and the rest on keeping the lights on, whatever it might be. Yes, I've seen different companies build a recommendation based on certain percentages of how they think teams should be spending their time.

(00:47:28):
We at Stripe think that, first and foremost, is that we have to make sure that folks are, number one, hired with the fact that they have great judgment and care for what they build, and they take pride in it. That's number one. Then, you can give a lot of trust to people based on that commitment to building great things that they will use that in their decision-making. Then, of course, it needs to be very clearly advocated for at the highest levels of the...

Katie Dill (00:48:01):
... Advocated for at the highest levels of the company. And with that, I think that fuels people's thinking as they're building their plans, but there is iteration in the plans and we do have multidisciplinary people making the plans together. So it's like, "Oh, okay, are we advancing these features? Are we going to be building growth? And is that improving the quality as well?" And so I think that's how we together get to it, but there's no formula that we ask people to.

Lenny (00:48:30):
So basically what I'm hearing is it's the cultural just people are hired with this expectation we are going to focus on quality and we'll prioritize things even though they may not move metrics because we know that this will generally improve and grow the business.

Katie Dill (00:48:43):
Part of it though is showing how it moves metrics, because I think that is a dangerous belief that is absolutely out there, as we talked about earlier, but that actual quality improvements do increase growth, they do improve the bottom line. For example, we saw that folks were reaching out to support because they didn't know the state of how one of their invoices was performing. And when we dig in, we realized it's, well, we had a button that looked nice, but it wasn't super clear, and so they didn't know how to access the thing that they were trying to do. And so by improving that, we decrease the need for them to have to reach out, which is clearly not their want to have to call somebody to find the answer to their problem. And so with that, we've made an improvement and we, of course, improve the bottom line because of that.

(00:49:38):
So I actually think that maybe one of the steps that somebody should consider in their organization is just you have those examples, every company does, where quality leads to better business outcomes and to talk about those and make them known, because I think it's actually a false belief that it's one or the other, it's like, "Are we going to work on quality and it doesn't move the metrics? And where we do." Some of them are longer term and so you have to look out for a while to see that change and the beliefs of your customers or how often they're sharing your product or how often they're succeeding in what they're trying to do, but some of them are short-term impacts and that is an important thing for people to be aware of because it will give them ideas of, oh, we could do this in our team too, we could have a higher quality product and actually move the business metrics.

Lenny (00:50:28):
Is there anything you do in how you evaluate performance of teams that helps prioritize this sort of thing? So generally it's just, cool, this team moved this metric by a ton, they're doing great. Is there anything that you bake into performance evaluations at Stripe, especially for product teams that help them understand and prioritize some of these things that may not obviously move metrics other than just broadly we believe great experiences are going to improve growth?

Katie Dill (00:50:54):
Well, I think one part is being clear on what impact means, because I do think that in some companies impact is just, okay, what business metric did I move and how much? And there are certainly really important impact projects that folks can have that maybe they're multi-quarter, multi-year, and so maybe you didn't move this incredibly important business metric in one quarter, but actually the work that you are doing is instrumental to the success of the business. So there's that. And then, like you said, there are perhaps quality efforts that are harder to measure or they're longer term, but they're still impactful. So I think number one is that when you're thinking about how to come up with the rubric for how you're going to judge performance, it's just really honing in on what does impact mean, and then a lot comes from that and being able to and celebrate and recognize great work happening even when it's not necessarily materially moving that number.

(00:51:59):
The other part of it is we have a ladder system. So it's a document that's not meant to lay out here's the checklist of all the things you need to do, but it's a guide for this is what is expected in your role and at this level, and in these documents we talk about the importance of things like quality in that what we pursue is building these things that are great. And another part of that is also the operating principles, which is the thing that we align on underneath all of these levels and ladders systems that we have. And our operating principles include meticulous craft. It is one of the things that is really important to us as an organization is just having that meticulous care for all that you do, whether it's you're designing the space that we work within or that you're creating the API or that you're building the interface or that you're talking to people on support calls, the meticulous craft is something that is actually expected of everybody.

Lenny (00:53:04):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products, customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product.

(00:53:53):
OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/leti.

(00:54:09):
I'm going to shift to a different topic and this is just the last area I want to spend some time on, which is team building leadership, that sort of thing. So you've led design at three hypergrowth companies, two of them, Airbnb and Stripe, are two of the biggest companies in the world, and also just known for great design. And I'm just going to ask a broad question, what have you learned about building, leading, managing, scaling large teams, are there lessons that stick with you? Anything come to mind when I ask that broad question?

Katie Dill (00:54:40):
One of the things that has stuck with me through all the trials and tribulations of leading, and as I've already laid out for you in the very beginning of this call, haven't always got it right, but one of the things that has been a clarifying force as I think about growing and leading teams, it's actually something I learned at Airbnb when we were there together, it's a formula sort of. So performance equals potential minus interference.

Lenny (00:55:10):
I love that.

Katie Dill (00:55:10):
And I really like this, it's pretty simple, but it's a good reminder that, as a leader, one of the things that you are of course driving towards is trying to get better performance so that your team feels more purpose and motivation and is excited about their work and that you're building greater things for your customers and you're having more business effect, and, of course, performance. But the key pieces of that, of course, is potential, so thinking about how you increase potential, which would be, of course, hiring really well, developing the talent and helping them grow and increase their own potential to do better and greater things. And then paired to that though of course is decreasing the interferences, which could be that lead weight on top of great talent, because you can hire the best people in the world, but like a muscle atrophying underneath a cast, if there are interferences that are holding them back from doing great work, they're going to burn out, they're not going to enjoy the work, they're not going to be as successful, and you will not get as strong of performance from it.

(00:56:14):
And so I really do think of this constantly as to how can I increase potential, how can I decrease interferences? And over time, especially as your company grows, you're going to have to keep doing that. The design work is never done in designing a team, because the more people you bring in, the more it puts your processes in a faulty state. I have intentionally run teams where you get to a point where it's like running hot, it's just like, "Okay, we've outgrown our processes." And that's okay because then you can learn as to, okay, this is how people are actually trying to work and this is how we actually can improve it. So making those changes as needed helps to make them more sought after and more informed in terms of as you improve the processes.

(00:57:05):
One of the things that I've been working on since I worked back at Airbnb was this idea of improving awareness of the things that are happening. What happens at a lot of companies, especially as they grow, is people lose touch with what's happening in different parts of the organization, and everybody's got a doc, their PRD, where they've written down what they've done and it's got tons of words that nobody really understands and keywords for the different projects, and that isn't the best way to lead to clarity. And I'm a strong believer that a picture tells a thousand words and a prototype saves a thousand meetings. What we do, and I've been doing it for the last decade or more, is having people within the design team share as a screenshot or a prototype of what they're working on in a shared deck.

(00:57:54):
And so they add this to a slide, in Google Slides decks every couple of weeks, and we get to see what's happening across the design team. And this is really important for all the designers because they could see, whether or not they're a team of 10 or 170 or whatever it might be, what is happening, and they can say, "Oh my gosh, you're working on that surface, so am I. And let's talk about it. Or Oh, that's an interesting pattern, maybe we could use this in more places." And we send it to the product managers and the engineer leaders and the leaders in the company because it is also a really great way for them to understand what's happening and what are we building together. Because going earlier, as I talked about, the importance of thinking about things as a journey, so what's happening in the marketing side, what's happening in this aspect of the product and seeing how all these pieces really fit together, that has been absolutely one of the things I will take wherever I go, whatever I do, because it has just been a very, very useful tool.

Lenny (00:58:51):
I remember that at Airbnb, and there's nothing more fun than just looking through a bunch of awesome designs and products that are in motion and in a deck form is so handy, just flip through what's going on around the company, I'm like, "Oh wow, look at this thing. That's amazing." And it's interesting that ends up in a deck, it feels like Figma would be really good for that too, but somehow decks are still really handy for simple things like that.

Katie Dill (00:59:11):
One of the key pieces is just keeping it really low maintenance. Yes, the design team would definitely prefer that it would be in Figma, but critically I want all functions to be able to look at it. And if not everybody is on Figma, if they were, that would be great too, but if they're not, it's just flipping through really easy, touch of a button, you can just send it off, it's behaviors that people are really used to and commenting. But maybe one day Figma.

Lenny (00:59:42):
And the way you do that is it's just like a scheduled call for all designers, add your stuff to this deck and then you email it out every two weeks I think you said?

Katie Dill (00:59:48):
Yeah, and we experiment with how often we ask folks to share and also the granularity of what they're doing. It is not meant to be a status check. We're not asking everyone, "Show us what you're doing." It's more of what are the projects that are happening? And we might ask, "Show us the medium and large projects," if there's such, it's too much going on and all of a sudden it's a 200-page deck and no one's going to flip through it. So we have experimented and evolved that depending on the team size, and I think right now we're at monthly sharing of it, and that seems to be working pretty well. It used to be biweekly, which I loved because I really love looking through, but if it's feels like it's a arduous task then it's not succeeding.

Lenny (01:00:31):
And especially knowing designers, they'd want to make sure it's the best version of what they've done, and it takes all this extra time to, okay, we got to make this beautiful mock to show [inaudible 01:00:39] working on.

Katie Dill (01:00:39):
And actually another part of it that is another benefit of opening up the curtain a little bit of certainly we have to take things seriously in terms of confidential work, it's work in progress, it's not ready to go live, we're not ready to critique all the details about this. We do need to make it very clear to folks that this is work in progress, but also that it is really beneficial to bring the work out because what isn't great is that you get to the end of the project and people have worked tirelessly on it for some long stretch of time and then find out that, oh my gosh, this is the same project that we're doing over here and this can be completely redundant, or these two things are on a path to collide.

(01:01:25):
So we want to know that sooner because it, absolutely, in the end of the day, will make the work better, save time. And so opening up that curtain and showing the work in progress, it can feel hard at first, but I think people have started to see the benefits in doing that and then usually that will lead to better outcomes in the long run in the culture too.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Going back to this formula you shared, which I love, performance equals potential minus interference, is there an example that comes to mind of helping with the interference where you found that, oh, wow, this is really slowing things down and you change something?

Katie Dill (01:01:59):
It actually goes back to org design that we talked about earlier and where people sit. So when I joined Lyft, as I mentioned to you earlier, I was like, oh, I had learned from the experience that I had at Airbnb and I came in needing to transform the organization, and was hopefully much better at it because I had learned so much. What actually was going on there is that the way that the team was organized before I got there was that actually physically the design team sat separately. They sat in a room that was just beautifully designed, separated from engineering and product and all the other functions by a locked door. And that was really interesting to see because of course there were a lot of benefits to it, which is that design had this very safe space for creative discovery and exploration and communication, there was work all over the walls, it was wall to wall whiteboards, and it was just absolutely a place where creativity could thrive.

Lenny (01:02:58):
It sounds exactly like the Airbnb situation, by the way.

Katie Dill (01:03:02):
The current Airbnb situation or the past?

Lenny (01:03:05):
The original, the [inaudible 01:03:05] times.

Katie Dill (01:03:07):
Yeah. And absolutely there are a lot of tie-ins to what I had seen. And the interesting part about how actually teams were working is that you would see that there was a lot of wasted work and there was a lot of misalignment in what we were trying to do because there was product managers and engineers that were sitting alongside each other making decisions and talking about the work and deciding things, and then designers were sitting over here in this other room and they were working on something, and then they'd meet up and it's like, "That's not aligned. No, that doesn't fit the goal. And you went that way, we were supposed to go over this way." And so interference in the sense that it was wasted work, it wasn't actually aligned to the goals, it was slower. And there were definitely benefits, there was real reasons for doing this, and I know there are companies including Apple that have separation of these things.

(01:03:58):
But I think if you're going into that way of working, there's probably a lot of other decisions you need to make too in terms of the way the teams work. And so what I was seeing there was just the composite of all these aspects coming together that was not leading to more efficient and less interference. And so what we did was to evolve the way we were working and bring better alignment to the different functions.

(01:04:22):
And, again, had done it with an approach about listening and came into that with a better understanding of getting to know the team and getting to know engineering and product and see what our goals were together so that when we were making changes we were making the changes together and we actually were aligned so that on the day that we opened the doors and brought design and product together and had spaces for folks to work together and they actually sat with each other, we still kept the creative space for this is where we'll do grits, this is where we'll do working sessions, this is where the folks that don't work in an embedded fashion we'll sit, but we had the best of both worlds in that way. And so with that alignment of the way that the teams were working together, there was much faster iteration cycles, better clarity on how the work was working, and we still kept and protected that room for creative space, literally the room in terms of figuratively speaking for allowing for creative exploration, but more aligned.

Lenny (01:05:23):
And just so I understand, essentially you reorged the teams and not just physically moved people, but you changed the way the product and design and eng team was even organized?

Katie Dill (01:05:35):
Yes, literally and figuratively we broke down the wall and brought the teams physically together so that they would work together, and then we had an org chart where it's like, okay, these designers are working on driver, these designers are working on rider, these designers are working on the safety team, and then they would sit with their respective engineers and product managers. And then as I talked about earlier, we would come together at key moments to make sure that we as a design function, we're still aligning on shared goals about the overall experience, but also making sure that we could work well with our partners.

Lenny (01:06:11):
So interesting that that was a recurring pattern at the places you went. I imagine Stripe was not like that, there was not all designers sitting in that locked room.

Katie Dill (01:06:18):
Not in a locked room. When I joined Stripe, it was a Zoom universe, so it's a little bit different, but even today we have a studio space where we have all the great tools of craft, and when you do go into the offices, we do have places where designers sit together, especially in the functions that aren't embedded. For example, we have brand and marketing creative, we have the website team, and we have folks that work across all of the things that we do. And so for sure there usually is some sort of creative space, which I actually think having a physical space for creative discovery and exploration and having that up on the wall, I love that so much. And I go into the office about halftime now, and I think over time we'll probably build that out more and more, because it is really powerful in addition to having teams sit by the disciplines that they work with every day.

Lenny (01:07:17):
It reminds me of a quote I have on my wall that I think I found in the Rick Rubin book, but it's by someone else, so I don't know exactly where I found it, but it's the object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.

Katie Dill (01:07:32):
Ooh, that's good. I like that very much.

Lenny (01:07:34):
By Robert Henry. That's what I try to do in this little podcast studio that we got here.

Katie Dill (01:07:39):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:07:41):
Is there anything else that you think would be useful to share either from scaling design teams or broadly?

Katie Dill (01:07:50):
I think one of the other tendencies I see of companies in different stages of their growth is a fear of bold ideas. What happens is that... It can happen at small sizes and then it can happen at large sizes actually, it's just that a fear of shaking things up too much or big ideas with lots of things changing at once are really hard to measure. And so actually if we just make an incremental approach, it's very measured and we know what the outcome is going to be, it feels safer, I can get it done in the quarter, and depending on how your performance is managed, that might be more attractive. And so that is a dangerous tendency, because I think if we go back to what quality means, and you think about it as, well, quality is really your users are the judge of that, and the way that they experience things oftentimes across products, across surface, across time, if you just think about these incremental approaches to the scope of whatever that is that you own, you are very likely not to make the whole thing better.

(01:08:57):
So I think we have to fight against that. And the way I look at it is, the way I talk about it is reach for the stars and land on the moon. And what I mean by that is that vision work is really important, and I think sometimes you can get a bad name because you can end up with some folks that are doing vision work that goes nowhere, and they make a beautiful deck and then it gets seated on a shelf and nobody ever builds it. That is not what I'm talking about here, that is not what I recommend, but actually vision work that absolutely does look at the entirety of the experience, a comprehensive approach, a journey approach, and thinks about how these various things may come together to be better, and sketch out the ideal version. And I think Brian Chesky talks about it, I think it was the 11-star experience I think he once said.

Lenny (01:09:45):
[inaudible 01:09:45] stuff. That's what we talked about a couple of times in this podcast.

Katie Dill (01:09:47):
Exactly. Looking at it as a journey. It's not the five-star approach, it's not the six-star approach, but the 11-star approach, but show what that ideal version is, because if you don't know what that is, what are the chances that you're going to increment yourself to the right outcome in the end? And as I talked about before, building the house, you want to see what that picture looks like and how all these pieces come together, and I strongly recommend you want to see what it looks like in an ideal form, because you can always work back from that.

(01:10:17):
And so it's like, "Okay, if this is what we want to get to, this is what our product is going to look like in two years, how do we get there?" And what very likely is it's a team effort and various parts of your organization are going to have to own various parts, and maybe we ship this piece first so that we can study it and learn and make sure that the data is good before we move to the next piece, I'm not suggesting you have to ship the whole thing at once, but that North Star lays out the process in a way that I think allows for big risk taking in a way that is measured and thoughtful and actually also feels like progress as you step towards that versus trying to get their day one and likely end up giving up.

Lenny (01:11:02):
I love that, reach for the stars, land on the moon. That could be a metaphor for so many things. Let me try to squeeze in one more tactical tip for people listening. If someone's hiring a designer, so someone that's not a designer, just a founder of product team, what should you look for that may be a red flag or something that you want to look for to feel good that they're going to be a good fit?

Katie Dill (01:11:23):
The key, I think, to keep in mind is it's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character, so I would certainly pay a lot of attention to that. Their hit rate for great judgment and great taste, and how they've honed that, even if they're not very experienced, just to see do they have that natural inclination for great things. The other piece of it is that certainly you want to find somebody with great talent, for sure, and high craft, but you...

Katie Dill (01:12:00):
Talent, for sure, and high craft, but you also want to find somebody that's humble. Folks that are really good at what they do aren't always, but humility is a really important part. I think it's a really important part for anybody on a team because if you're working on a team, you need to work together. And it is important that they have that respect and empathy and understanding and enthusiasm for the folks around them, but also the users. Humility means that they're going to pay more attention to what the users are saying and hopefully be curious about what's working and what's not, and strive to navigate these things to make it better. The last piece would just be hustle or chutzpah. I'm not sure exactly what's the right way to put it, but the design and the creative functions is the act of creation.

(01:12:53):
And it's scary. To take a blank piece of paper and propose something that you think is better, is scary. To have the courage to say, "This is not good enough and we should do it again," is scary. Having somebody that has that courage inside them to fight for great is pretty important. And that hustle to try to execute on that rapidly is, of course, essential as you're hiring at any stage company.

(01:13:23):
Lastly, I think you were asking in particular, especially with younger companies or with startups, I think one thing that can be hard, it's like do you hire a more junior doer or a more senior thinker/operator? It's like if you had all the money in the world, all of it. But I do think in your early stages you probably do need a doer, but it is important to also have that lens of how do you build an organization that's user-focused and the way that they operate and the way that they work together, and bringing a strategy that will help to be user-focused from the start. Maybe a great way of doing that is having a more senior leader, design advisor, and then a kind of executor or doer full-time on the team.

Lenny (01:14:10):
That's a really cool tip. On the craft and taste piece, a lot of times people don't have that themselves necessarily. Any tip for how to measure that? Is there a book you'd recommend or trick? Or is it just trust your judgment and does this feel great to you?

Katie Dill (01:14:28):
It's contingent on what is the thing, what is the user need? Something that is really great, we do a lot of tools that we strive to make them power tools for our users. And a lot of times that means dense information that is still easily accessible, but will definitely feel different than perhaps a consumer product that is meant to be extremely light and sparse and directive to one individual thing at a time. So it really depends on the context of the product sometimes. That's why it's hard to kind of quote an individual book. But yeah, I can think on it and we can put it in the show notes. There are definitely books that talk about the principles of great design and we can look at that.

Lenny (01:15:12):
Amazing. We'll link to extra books that come to mind after. One other question I wanted to ask is, what's a favorite project that y'all have worked on at Stripe?

Katie Dill (01:15:21):
Oh yeah, we got a good one that I'm so excited about. First off, I don't know if everybody knows this, but Stripe prints books. Stripe Press, we print books that are, we consider, ideas of progress. It's our intention of bringing great ideas out there. Most of them don't have anything to do with financial infrastructure. It might be any number of interesting problems and opportunities of things and ideas that people have talked about.

Lenny (01:15:50):
I have many of them in my background here. I'm a huge fan of Stripe Press.

Katie Dill (01:15:55):
Nice. And we take great care to deliver these ideas of progress and books that hopefully feel beautiful. We have a new book coming up that you can pre-order now, and it is Poor Charlie's Almanac. It's actually-

Lenny (01:15:55):
Already pre-ordered.

Katie Dill (01:15:55):
You did? I actually excited to hear that.

Lenny (01:15:55):
I'm really excited for it.

Katie Dill (01:16:12):
It's a fascinating book. It's 20 years old. It's actually Charlie Munger's words, but Peter Kaufman, a friend and a colleague of his, assembled all of these documents over the years of things that Charlie had written and said and put it into this kind of anthology. And so this book is really fascinating and it's not really a linear story so much. We have reprinted this book. We created a teaser site that I strongly recommend you all check out. It's really, really fun.

Lenny (01:16:41):
Oh, man, it's unreal. I remember when you launched that. I was like, "It just keeps going and gets crazier and wilder and amazing." I don't even know how that's possible on a website.

Katie Dill (01:16:49):
It's pretty awesome. Our website team is... We talked about the importance of design and engineering working super closely together. It's just like that. That art and science coming together into something that hopefully is fun and engaging and people want to pursue it. So the book will be coming out soon and we're working on an update to the site that we're really, really thrilled about, so you can read the book online in a special way. So yeah, very big fan of this.

Lenny (01:17:17):
What's the website for folks? Do you happen to have the URL? Otherwise, we'll link to it in the show notes for

Katie Dill (01:17:21):
The book. Yeah, yeah. It is press.stripe.com will be where you can see all the books that we have at Stripe Press. And I believe the first one in the line... And actually what you'll see in the website is that we originally had a typical buying model of the squares outlined. One of the things that we sought to do with the website is to consider what would be a great experience for understanding different books. And when you go into a bookstore and you see the spines of the books and you pick them up and you turn them around and you look at them. And so that's actually what you will... I should stop describing it. Just go and check it out and you'll see we sought to deliver this work in a way that would be aligned with what a reader would want to pursue.

Lenny (01:18:07):
I can't help but ask, but how did that even come together? Was it just like this passion project of like, "This book's coming out, I just want to invest a bunch of time resources into this?" Or how does that happen at Stripe?

Katie Dill (01:18:19):
Stripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. We strive to build global economic prosperity because that's greater access across the globe. But there's more ways to do that than financial infrastructure. Financial infrastructure is absolutely a major part of that. It is like the lifeblood of businesses, and it enables them to accomplish more. But this notion of ideas of progress is another angle into that. While it might not be our core business, it is very much aligned with our mission. And so yes, it takes time, but we feel that it's important for what we're setting out to do. And it also relates to the pursuit of creativity and excellence. It is a part of our identity. It is a part of who we feel we are or we strive to be, and we're excited to share that with people. It's in some ways how they get to know us and they get to see the care that we put into any number of things.

Lenny (01:19:19):
Katie, is there anything else you want to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Katie Dill (01:19:24):
We talked a little bit about the importance of different disciplines and the importance of quality being a group effort. I hope this doesn't insult my function, as I say, but at the core, design is simply intention. You're bringing intentionality to the decisions that you make in thinking about who is this thing for. If you're designing a doorknob, let's say, and it's like, "Does the doorknob speak to whether or not I'm going to push or pull or turn? Is it comfortable in the hand? Is it easy to manufacture? Is it easy to put on and remove?" These are some of the intentional decisions one could make, whether or not they're a designer, an engineer, the product person, any old function can put that intentionality.

(01:20:17):
If you think about who is impacted by this, who is using this? And that literally could be anything from designing a doorknob to designing your org structure to designing your strategy. Obviously, great design is also creative, and it also is demonstrated with great taste for what is beauty. Of course, that's where I would say that design expertise with people that have these creative skills and this great taste is an incredible important thing to bring into the organization. Day one, everybody can bring more care and intentionality, and I think that will result in better outcomes, internally and externally, in the long run.

(01:20:56):
I think your podcast is a great example of great craft and great quality. I was just saying this to my husband the other day, as I was talking about doing this. It's just like, your podcasts... There's more usable learning per minute than most. I don't know if that's a metric that you're measuring, but I love how you don't have your guests tell about their background. Because when someone tells about their background, that is interesting, but it's not really usable information. It's like, "I can take this information and run with it and then bring it to my own team and make my work better." You have clearly thought about that. Well, I don't know if that's why you made that decision.

Lenny (01:21:38):
Absolutely. That is exactly [inaudible 01:21:40]

Katie Dill (01:21:41):
Okay, great. I also love the way that you set these things up. You had said to me, in the thing that you set me, it's just like, "If it's not good, we're not going to ship it." And you set it in very nice ways, by the way. But at first I had this like, "Oh gosh, what if it's not good?" But I also had this moment of like, "Well, that's pretty great because if it's not good, he's not going to embarrass me to the rest of the world, hopefully." And I love that because that was that courage that I was talking about earlier, too, of that you're not going to let bad go out, because you know that each one of these little things will end up leading to a belief of the level of quality of what somebody can rely on getting when they listen to your podcast. Again, one workout isn't going to be a six-pack, but every one of those things will end up leading to better quality overall. I don't know, kudos to you. You're nailing it. So great.

Lenny (01:22:36):
Katie, what a nice way to end it. I really appreciate that. That's exactly how I think about it, actually. You cracked my whole strategy of just making it as concretely useful as possible. I was actually on David Perell's podcast recently and he had this really good way of describing this, which is exactly what I've tried to do, but I haven't put my words into it of make it as useful as possible per minute without removing the humanity. And I realized that's what I do, is I could cut all the stories of everyone's backgrounds, but that sucks. It's optimize for value and concrete, tactical advice, but also make it fun and human and interesting.

(01:23:15):
So thank you for the kind words. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a number of questions for you. Are you ready?

Katie Dill (01:23:24):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:23:25):
Okay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Katie Dill (01:23:30):
One, How to Win Friends and Influence People. It's an oldie but a goodie. I forget how many years old it is, but many, many decades. I think it was in the 1930s? The cover is funny. You might be embarrassed to read it on a bus, I don't know. But the learnings from it are timeless, and I've actually read it four times and I can always do for another because it is a great reminder of just how important the way you articulate things are. And not in a negative or gross kind of way, but people care first and foremost about themselves. That's the body that they're within, that is the context that they're within. Recognizing that can be really powerful as you think about leading teams, as you think about working with other people, as you think about being a good spouse, whatever it might be. I'm a big fan of that one.

(01:24:19):
The other one is a newer book, I think actually still a couple of years old. It's about the Wright Brothers by David McCullough, I think. I've been learning how to fly, and so I'm very obsessed with this, but I think it's a book that's relevant to everybody. Especially even entrepreneurs, because it just talks about the impossible challenge of nobody thought it could be done. Even the American Institute of Science didn't think it could be done. And these individuals that had the resolve and the commitment to make it happen. I think also the power of this beautiful partnership. Of course, they're brothers. That doesn't always mean you get along, but they're brothers and they did, and it's a beautiful story. Big, big, big fan of that.

(01:25:05):
And then third book, I would just say is... Actually, I brought it over because I knew you were going to ask me this question. I don't know if you could read that, but The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse. This book was given to me by Jenny Yarden, which I think you may know. It's wonderful. It's a beautiful story. It makes you laugh, it teaches you a thing or two, and one of the best quotes in it is, "One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things."

Lenny (01:25:32):
Very Buddhist.

Katie Dill (01:25:33):
Yes.

Lenny (01:25:35):
What is a recent favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Katie Dill (01:25:39):
Oppenheimer was amazing. And TV show? Shrinking. And that one was really good, and it actually really surprised me how funny and positive it was, because the trailer for it does not give that impression. But it was really good.

Lenny (01:25:55):
I've not seen that. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Katie Dill (01:26:01):
Tell me what work you are most proud of. And the reason I ask that is because it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Lenny (01:26:28):
Is there a favorite product you recently discovered, be it an app or physical thing? Anything?

Katie Dill (01:26:32):
Yeah. As a parent, you should definitely know the Toniebox.

Lenny (01:26:37):
Ooh, I don't don't know this. The Toniebox?

Katie Dill (01:26:40):
It's so good. The Toniebox. I should have brought it over, too. So it's like a squishy box, but it's a speaker. And your kids can control it. And the way they control it is these little figurines. This is also a brilliant product because you want to buy all these figurines. But the little figurines, it could be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast or Elsa from Frozen, and they place the figurine on top and that activates the stories that the thing reads to you or the songs that it plays for you. You can record your own voice so that you're telling stories to your child. And they control it all by themselves and they can drop it on the floor and it's all good. But the Toniebox, pretty awesome.

Lenny (01:27:20):
I just texted my wife to check this out so I don't forget. Amazing. Great. Very handy and timely. Do you have a favorite life motto that you'd like to share, come back to, find meaningful?

Katie Dill (01:27:31):
I don't say this out loud, but I've had it as a Post-It in my jewelry box and that I see regularly. Tomorrow is today. And what I mean by that is that so often I will in my head be like, "I'll do that tomorrow. I'll eat better tomorrow. I'll think about that vision tomorrow. I'll communicate better expectations tomorrow." And it's like those joke signs that "Free beer tomorrow." Because very easily, tomorrow just always moves on. And I needed to remind myself that it's actually, it is now today. Tomorrow is now today.

Lenny (01:28:14):
I love that one. I feel like I need to take all these mottoes, which are amazing. I love this question that I just invented. And just put them all on my wall here in this office.

Katie Dill (01:28:22):
Yes, that's a great idea. You should make a book. Book of Lenny Mottoes.

Lenny (01:28:26):
Oh, man. The Tribe of Mentors version of Lenny's podcast.

Katie Dill (01:28:29):
That's awesome.

Lenny (01:28:30):
Is there a lesson that your mom or dad taught you that has really stuck with you, especially as a newish parent?

Katie Dill (01:28:39):
I think about this a lot. I am a mom of twin girls, and I feel so lucky that my parents raised me to see that accomplishment is based on merit and hard work. They never made me feel like because I was small and that I was not as strong as somebody, whatever it might be, that I wasn't able. My dad had me chopping wood and mixing cement as a young kid, and that certainly led me in one part to be a designer, but also to be able to pursue leadership. Even though sometimes I'm comfortable willing to be in the room where I am vastly outnumbered by people that don't look like me or just not letting that hold me back.

(01:29:31):
And actually, I thought about that the other day because I was riding in a Lyft to the airport. This was also at 4:00 AM, so it was a really hard time to be in a Lyft to gone to the airport. The driver was telling me about his kids, and actually he had twins. It was one boy and one girl, and so we were talking about twins. He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, my girl, she's my princess. My son doesn't understand why I don't let her take out the garbage and why her job is to sweep and that's his job." He's like, "I'm not going to let her take out the garbage." I was sitting in the back of the car wondering, "Should I tell him, you're screwing it up?"

(01:30:07):
Just because she's a female doesn't mean that she's not able to do the jobs, even the hard ones and even the bad ones taking off the trash. I really do think that I'm so fortunate that that was never the way that my parents were looking at it. Now, today, I feel like that is very much a part of a little bit of my chutzpah and willingness to step out there because I hadn't been held back from those hard jobs earlier.

Lenny (01:30:39):
Final question. You mentioned that you fly planes, and this is actually related to my last question. I guess one that I was going to ask if that's true, you mentioned it is true. Is there a lesson that you've taken from learning to fly and flying that you've brought into product, leadership, design? Anything come to mind?

Katie Dill (01:30:57):
First of all, learning to fly has been such an amazing experience because there haven't been many things in my adult life where you feel like yourself going from knowing nothing about something and being able to do something, and what an incredible journey that is. Whether it's learning a language or whatever, that is awesome and highly recommended. But one of the key things that has definitely sat with me from the experience of learning how to fly that I definitely thought about how to bring it into my work is that when I was getting to the stage of being able to do things myself... My instructor is sitting there next to me and usually is right there at the controls with me, so if something goes wrong when I'm flying, he's right there.

(01:31:46):
I remember one of the first times when I was learning how to land where he moved his seat back. A lot. And so he was now out of touch with the controls. He could jump there if he needed to, but he really pulled back. And it was such an incredible visceral experience. I was like, "He trusts me. Right now, he is showing his faith in me to take this and take this challenge on." And I think about that all the time. It's just like, "How can I show my team, people I work with, my support and trust in them to take that challenge on?" I can't always move my seat back, but what might be the way? And so that's been a pretty great example of something I want to pull forward.

Lenny (01:32:35):
That is an awesome metaphor. I feel like this whole episode is just full of beautiful metaphors. Also, just full of beauty. Katie, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Katie Dill (01:32:50):

# Twitter’s ex-Head of Product on Elon, consumer products, culture, more | Kayvon Beykpour

## Transcript

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:00):
The first time I ever met Elon was over FaceTime. He was just like, "Do you want to just come hang out? You can swipe left or swipe right."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:15):
We wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
Here's a list of stuff that your team shipped while you were there, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, Fleets, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, Twitter Blue, Spaces, and obviously, live video.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:31):
The sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
This was all relatively quickly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:39):
I was like, "I might flame out completely, but Hell if I don't try."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Today, my guest is Kayvon Beykpour. Kayvon was the beloved and longest-tenured head of product at Twitter and also GM of the consumer business at Twitter up until the day that it was sold to Elon Musk. He landed at Twitter through an acquisition of his company, Periscope, which was the world's largest live-streaming platform, which ended up inspiring Instagram Live, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and basically every other social network getting into live video. He sold the company to Twitter in 2015, continued leading Periscope for a number of years, and then moved into leading product and then the entire consumer business.

(00:01:19):
In our wide-ranging conversation, Kayvon shares what it was like getting Elon up to speed at Twitter, what it was like to be fired from Twitter, which actually happened during his pat leave. He also shares all kinds of lessons and stories from transforming Twitter's internal culture from a risk-averse, stagnant, product org to one that was shipping major features regularly. We talk about how they used acquihires and up-and-coming hungry product leaders to lead new initiatives and break through many of their sacred cows.

(00:01:47):
We also get into jobs-to-be-done, Elon's layoffs of most of Twitter's staff after the acquisition, his lessons from building and shutting down Periscope, and also building consumer products in general, and so much more. This episode is full of stories and lessons and a bunch of stuff that you haven't heard anywhere else. With that, I bring you Kayvon Beykpour after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:03:23):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug.

(00:03:45):
Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:04:28):
Kayvon, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:04:35):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. Great to meet you finally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):
It's amazing to meet you. I think this is going to be quite a unique and interesting podcast. A big thank you to Scott Belsky, illustrious former podcast guest for introducing us. When he introduced us, the one thing that he told me is that "Hopefully, Kayvon will share the story about our time getting Elon up to speed at Twitter." I would love to hear that story. I bet other people would too. Are you able to share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:05:03):
When all the drama went down with Twitter and Elon ended up buying the company and after the eight months saga of legal back and forth ended up actually taking control of the company, there was that first two-day period where it was complete chaos at Twitter with the sink and Elon spreading his tentacles trying to find out who are the people that he wants to keep and what are the projects that are interesting. In the midst of all that, Scott ended up getting contacted and being asked, "Who should Elon talk to?" Scott recommended that Elon chat with me.

(00:05:42):
So, the first time I ever met Elon was over at FaceTime where Elon was just very curious to ask, "Hey, you were at Twitter for a while. You seem to have done some things. What should I be digging into, and who I be talking to?" At the end of that conversation, we ended up arranging an in-person meeting where Scott and I went to Twitter HQ to actually meet Elon. I think this was day two of Elon having brought the sink in. So, we had this really bizarre, wild, but really fun experience of walking into Twitter HQ, and in my case, walking back to Twitter HQ for the first time after having been fired, which was a very strange experience for me, and we walked into the building.

(00:06:29):
I was scurried through the back door because I didn't want to make a scene and make it ... There was a lot of rumors around is Kayvon coming back, and I just wanted to avoid all of that. So, it was just a very weird experience of being scurried through the elevator and through the back door and go to this massive conference room, which we had on the second floor of the 110th building.

(00:06:53):
In that massive conference room, it was me, Scott, Elon, and then at the very, very end of the room, Walter Isaacson, who by the way, I had a hard time. I knew I recognized. I'd never met Walter in person, but I was like, "Is that Walter Isaacson?" But he said nothing the entire time, and we had probably a two-hour conversation talking about the past, the future of Twitter, the good, the bad, the ugly. At the very end of the conversation, Walter came up and introduced himself and was like, "Hi, I'm Walter. Can I get your information just in case I need to ask any follow-up questions?" And I was like, "Oh, shit. I guess that whole conversation was on the record. I don't know."

(00:07:31):
So, it was a very surreal experience for a bunch of reasons, including just being weird for me since I was very conflicted about coming back to Twitter, even physically in the office. But I must say it was really fun. It was fun talking to someone. Obviously Elon, I'd never met him before, and he's one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. So, that was exciting to go into that meeting. Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, "Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want. And by the way, here's some crazy dreams I have for doing it."

(00:08:35):
It was just a really ... As someone who had had their own dreams for the product, witnessing that it was really unusual and cool. I think that's probably what Scott meant when he said, "You should ask Kayvon about that," was that I think we both kind of recognized that something's about to happen here. Obviously, you have this very public spectacle of someone essentially having a takeover of a public company, but all of that stuff aside, also, you could tell Elon was scheming and cooking up, "What am I going to do with this?" It was cool to see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):
That's an amazing story. I love the Walter Isaacson component of it. Do you feel like you made a dent on his approach and way of thinking? Obviously, he made a lot of big radical changes. Do you feel like you made a dent in his view of where Twitter should go?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:09:26):
I don't know. I certainly don't think I've made any impression on how he should run the company. I think that's Elon's going to Elon in his way, and I think he certainly has had some radical moves in terms of how he's running the company, the decisions he made, how many people he let go, how the company is structured, the culture, and all that stuff is like ... We didn't even talk about that stuff.

(00:09:49):
I think what we spent time talking about is I shared my perspective with him of people I thought who were exceptional, who were at the company, and if I was in his shoes, who I would spend time with and embrace. Most of the people that I mentioned are still there, which is awesome, and they seem to be A, empowered, which is great, and B, having fun, which is awesome. So, hopefully, that stuff is useful.

(00:10:16):
We spent a bunch of time brainstorming products, and I had my set of projects that I was very passionate about because we'd given birth to them. I think a bunch of those projects, it seems like Twitter's still investing in and putting a lot of energy behind like Community Notes, which at the time was called Birdwatch. But I always felt really bullish on that being the future of essentially how content is moderated on Twitter, just because it was very clear that the way we were handling content moderation among many other flaws just wasn't scalable.

(00:10:55):
Spaces and Communities and the Creator Program of helping people make money on the platform, those are projects that we started over the year-ish prior to Elon taking over. My hope, having left the company and having had a new leader come in, was that those things would be given more oxygen. It's been awesome to see that those have been continuing to grow and be molded in different directions. Yeah, I think in that sense, I hope that our brainstorm was useful, but for all I know he doesn't even remember the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):
I freaking love Community Notes. It's such an amazing product. Let me ask two more dramatic-oriented Elon Twitter questions just to get these out of the way. The first is you said you were fired. I don't know if you've shared that publicly. People always wondered, I think, what happened. I know you tweeted during your pat leave, "I'm leaving Twitter," and no one really knows the story as far as I know. What actually went on there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:11:53):
It was weird, to say the least. Honestly, it took me some time to come to peace with it because it was frustrating and surprising. I guess the story of what happened starts with Jack resigning. Jack resigned in ... It was like November of 2021 at the end of the year. The board chose Parag to be the CEO of the company, and I've had a long relationship with Parag. I respect him, but I had mixed feelings about that.

(00:12:23):
To his credit, Parag very quickly addressed one of the biggest things that I was really frustrated about in the last three years essentially of my time at Twitter. One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model, meaning we had a head of consumer product, me, we had a head of revenue product, Bruce, we had a head of engineering, we had a head of design, we had head research. It was a functionally run organization.

(00:12:52):
And the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict and make sure the team is moving quickly. And Jack, for all of his amazing qualities, just wasn't operating that way, and so you had a group of highly opinionated people that often disagreed and would create either the need for consensus or deadlock. That just was driving a lot of people crazy, including me, and I think it really held us back from living up to Twitter's potential.

(00:13:29):
Anyway, all of that was super frustrating for me, and the combination of that and a dramatic change in leadership with Jack leaving and Parag coming in, I wasn't feeling too stoked. Parag to his credit, when he became CEO, quickly changed that and shifted the company to be a GM structure. And he promoted me to being the GM of consumers. So, for the prior three-ish years, having been responsible for growing Twitter's consumer product, I was only responsible for the product management team. I didn't have engineering or design, and that honestly was difficult. It's very difficult to change culture with one hand tied behind your back.

(00:14:10):
Still no regrets. Had a lot of fun. I think we had some impact, but it was frustrating. So, Parag changed that. The irony of this, by the way, is he was one of the biggest proponents of the functional structure. When he became a CEO, he changed the structure, promoted me to be the GM of consumer, and I was, at that point, one month ... This is one month before I went on pat leave because my daughter was due.

(00:14:35):
So, I went into my paternity leave being like, "All right, I'm going to give this a shot. We'll see. We'll see how this goes," as Parag addressed the biggest frustration that I had with the company and how it was being run. So, I had some trepidations but went into my pat leave feeling optimistic. Mind you, this was all before Elon was even part of the picture. He had not become a board member. There was no news about him having beef with the executive team or for that matter, trying to buy the company.

(00:15:06):
So, I went on pat leave maybe a week and a half before our daughter's due date. Three weeks goes by. In that three weeks, Elon joins the board, leaves the board, makes an offer, has a short dramatic feud about whether that goes through. And also during that time, my daughter was born. Some drama at the hospital for us, but a week afterwards, we come home. Mom's healthy. Daughter's healthy.

(00:15:35):
The day after we get home from the hospital, Parag called me and said that he was letting me go and that he was taking the team in a different direction. That night, Twitter signed a term sheet with Elon to sell the company. So, a lot happened in a very short period of time, and the reason that Parag gave is exactly what I shared publicly, which was that he wanted to take the team in a different direction. The only other thing he said is that given that new direction, he thinks that the things that I'm good at, Twitter doesn't need anymore. And the things that Twitter needs are not particularly in my skill set or in my interest.

(00:16:14):
He wasn't particularly expressive about what that direction was, but that was the reason he gave me. That was a huge bummer for me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love the company. I love the product, and also it just sucks to leave not on your own terms. And two, I was just confused. The timing was very frustrating and confusing for me, not least of which because I had just come home from the hospital while on paternity leave. But also because at that time, especially the fact that Elon was buying the company was ...

(00:16:48):
Well, I was conflicted, honestly. I was very excited because Elon is someone that I looked up to immensely, and you just look at the things that he's achieved in the world and you can't help but be inspired by that. And two, Twitter for all of, I think, the impact and progress that we had made, had a lot of challenges associated with its governance and the fact that it was constantly vulnerable as a public company. So, there's just always this drama associated with Twitter as a public company, even a private company before that, that made it extremely hard as a builder to get shit done and have the product live up to its potential.

(00:17:27):
One of the benefits of this particular takeover was that Elon offered a path towards solving all of that. It was like, "Oh, cool, now you've got one owner who happens to be, by the way, extremely opinionated about the product and a voracious consumer and creator of the product." I think there was an incredible opportunity in that that now you have this organization and this product and this incredible ecosystem that can be devoid of all the political bullshit associated with being a public company. Now, it has this conduit to just living up to its potential.

(00:17:59):
So, it was a bummer to be removed from that, I suppose, without having any agency myself. That was very a long-winded answer to your question, but that's what happened towards the end there. Like I said at the beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with it and to be at peace with it. I did eventually. Listen, there's a huge silver lining of I spent the first year of my daughter's life with her and my family. My wife Sarah had left Twitter eight months prior to me leaving, and so when's the next time we could all be together and have time and space to just enjoy each other and our new family, and frankly, to avoid a lot of the drama that ended up ensuing that not a lot of people could have predicted? The deal was on. The deal was off. It is just a whole lot of drama that I got to miss, which is the silver lining.

(00:18:53):
Then it was confusing there for a bit because when Elon did end up buying the company, in that conversation that I had with him, it was definitely ... I was conflicted about do I want to maybe spend some time working on this still? Elon was very cool about ... He actually used this phrase at the end of our conversation, which I still find hilarious. He was just like, "Do you want to just come? You seem like you care about the product, and you don't have dumb ideas. Do you want to come hang out?" And I was like, "What would my job be?" And he was like, "Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right." He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
For ideas that come up just like, "Here, I have this idea [inaudible 00:19:41]?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:40):
No, like swipe right on whether you want to be here or swipe ... He's like, "We don't have to make this a thing. Just do you want to hang out and work on the product with us?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:40):
That's so funny.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:51):
So, I ended up deciding that actually, I'm just ready. I'm ready to move on. I spent enough time at this company, at this product trying to shape it into something that I was passionate about. I think it's someone else's turn, and especially Elon. If you buy it's your turn. You can do whatever you want with it.

(00:20:13):
So, that was conflicting for a bit, but I would say towards the end of the year, it was pretty clear in my mind that I was ready to move on and start thinking about other problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
What I think about is there's always this tension being a PM at a company with a very strong-minded, product-oriented founder, and I feel like you would've been in the epitome worst possible situation there, where you're a product leader between Elon and the rest of org. So, I think it probably would not have worked out.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:20:40):
I'm not sure I would've been able to articulate it as succinctly as you did just now, but I think that is the feeling that I had that it's not my place anymore. I don't have a canvas to try and exert my dreams on this place. I think Elon took that mantle, and I'm excited to see what he going to do with it is the feeling I had.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
Yeah. You've touched on this. You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time, all kinds of stuff. So, here's a list of stuff that I've gathered your team shipped while you were there. Twitter Blue, which is I think called Premium now, Spaces, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, fleets, being able to see Instagram photos in line, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, tons of UX improvements, and obviously, live video. What did you learn about how to change a product culture from a company that's very risk-averse and essentially just not shipping a lot to taking big, bold bets and becoming a lot more open to new stuff?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:21:53):
Trying to drive culture change is both one of the most challenging things and rewarding things. For the first year of my role ... There was a chapter of my time at Twitter, maybe just to backup, that was just leading Periscope. In that first chapter of maybe two years, I was not really involved with Twitter stuff all that much. That started to change when we really tried integrating Periscope with Twitter, but chapter two of my time at Twitter was when I became the head of product. That first year of being the head of product was one of the most difficult of my career not because the work was difficult, but because it was so politically and bureaucratically exhausting to try and change culture in a way that just there wasn't alignment around.

(00:22:40):
It comes back to the point I was making earlier around the organization of the company was functional, and so it is one thing for me to have some ideas and a plan and a strategy that I felt compelling. But when you have to essentially drive consensus amongst your peers across the other functions, that's a different game. That's not execution. That's politics and consensus building. I both can't stand that stuff, but I think ... This is going to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but good enough at it and I have enough patience at it that I invested the time and the energy. I think a less patient person wouldn't have bothered and would've thrown their hands up.

(00:23:25):
I think honestly, a lot of it just comes down to I had practice. At my first company that I started in college with one of my best friends, Joe, who I ended up co-founding Periscope with, we got acquired by a big, public, ad tech company called Blackboard, and we were 19 at the time. We got thrown into a public ... I was a senior executive at a public company that was not your quintessential tech company. It was even more difficult to get things done. So, through the four years I spent there, I learned a lot about how to navigate that type of environment.

(00:23:56):
It all came coming back when I was given the product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like-

Kayvon Beykpour (00:24:00):
... product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some of those plans, I think it ended up, it got easier and easier. It becomes addicting. I think people end up feeling like, oh wow, maybe these sacred cows we had didn't need to be so sacred.

(00:24:37):
And so I think after that first year, it became a lot more fun. It was still difficult, but it felt like we were all swimming in the same direction a lot more. But I think my takeaway there is you can't change culture without having alignment from the top. It's difficult to change culture when you have a pocket of a company trying to advocate for change.

(00:25:01):
So I think we got there in the end. We didn't move as much urgency as I think we drove. We were not fast enough, we were not bold enough. I was consistently dissatisfied with what I was achieving and what our team was achieving. But I think we did make a change. Twitter was an organization that had a lot of sacred cows and became very [inaudible 00:25:24] in its ways. Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working.

(00:25:42):
And listen, as much as I was kind of throwing stones from the sidelines through that period when I was in Periscope land in our separate office a few blocks away from the mothership, that focus actually did help the company for some period. The reason why Twitter went from stagnant to declining DAU growth to growing DAU again is because they refined the core. This is when they went from the reverse chronological timeline to the ranked timeline, and the year after that was a lot of knob turning. It was like, how do we make these recommendations better? How do we make our push notifications more relevant?

(00:26:16):
Now, that is not an inspiring product strategy. That does not result in the product feeling materially different or adding new capabilities, but it did return the company to user growth. And I think that the fact that it did actually calcified the organization's reticence to take any risky bets even more. So it was a very interesting predicament because when I got into the role, the goal wasn't to change that progress. We wanted to continue reaping the benefits of refining the things about the product that were working really well. What we wanted to change was a lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product was changed at all.

(00:26:58):
Because you would hear people, I mean, one of the beautiful things about working on Twitter as a product is that you have literally customers being injected into your veins. Every single day, whatever you change about a product or whatever you don't change, they're telling you what they love and what they hate. And it is both exhausting and exhilarating. It is one of the most ridiculous luxuries of product development, is working on a product that many people use and therefore you get that much feedback around.

(00:27:25):
And it was a very common thing for us to hear people say, "What are you all doing over there? The product hasn't changed in eight years." And that was horrible to hear, and I felt it too, as a critic on the sidelines, as a user who wasn't an employee who eventually became an employee, I had the same feedback. And so that was my mission. I was like, I am somehow ridiculously in this fortunate position that I've been entrusted some responsibility here. I might flame out completely, but hell if I don't try. And so that was both fun and exhausting, like I said.

(00:28:00):
But it was as simple as starting with we are voracious users of the product ourselves, and if we aren't, by the way, that's its own problem. I think that in order to build something wonderful, you have to be a customer of the product. And sure, I'm sure you could point to businesses and products where that's not the case, and I'm sure there's a flaw in that philosophy somewhere, but I've always believed that one of the best ways to build products is to be a customer yourself and to find your own pain points and to build a product that you want to use. And so that's actually not that hard to do if you're a user of Twitter and you can think critically. It was ripe with opportunity. And so it was actually really fun and amazing to be able to craft a plan that started to take a swing at some of these things.

(00:28:50):
And the other thing I'll add to this is that there were so many sacred cows at Twitter that the sacred cows are their own roadmap. It's like a built-in free roadmap of like, all right, what are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there. Everything from moving from reverse chron to a ranked feed, that was a sacred cow. Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.

(00:29:21):
It's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you don't like it or it's abusive, we're not touching that. We can't annotate tweets with [inaudible 00:29:30], all that stuff, those are all sacred cows. And the process of starting to address those one by one reveals a lot of the cultural hesitations that existed.

(00:29:43):
So yeah, I'll never forget one of the first features, and this is such a tiny feature that we worked on after I started the role, we were building this feature called hide replies. It still exists in the product today. If someone replies to one of your tweets, in the tweet details area as a reply to one of your conversations, before you had no ability, the only way you could address unwanted content was reporting it. So that was like Twitter acting as policemen and policewoman, completely unscalable and challenging, especially in the context of someone replying to one of your tweets.

(00:30:18):
And so we wanted to add a feature that let you hide a reply to one of your tweets, and it's not impacting what people say. It's not impacting free speech in the sense of you can still broadcast whatever you want, but if you're going to come into my reply space and say some shit that I don't want to see in my feed, I should be able to hide that. Tweet what you want, but don't at mention. You can't scream in my face basically.

(00:30:40):
And I remember we had a PM on our team who was leading this feature who a few weeks into this project mentioned to me that she had had a conversation with someone on the engineering team that told them, "Don't work on this feature. This is bad for your career. This is not going to launch, and you don't want to work on this. You don't want to be seen as having worked on this." Because it was so kind of anathema to we can't let people hide replies to their tweets. And I just remember hearing that and my blood was boiling. That is the most, it was such an interesting representation of the culture, not just hesitation to try new things, which by the way, that product might've failed. And that's fine, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

(00:31:27):
But to go so far as to dissuade someone else who was excited about experimenting with a hypothesis to see if it could help customers on the platform and telling them, "Don't work on this. It's bad for your career." As a microcosm for some of the cultural challenge we had around trying big, bold bets, which by the way, this wasn't even a big, bold bet. It was such an innocuous thing to try. But there was a lot of that and it made it very difficult without some sheer force of will and also just a lot of effort. So there was a lot of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):
Kayvon, there's fractals of stories that I could infinitely follow. There's so much interesting stuff here. One that just stands out is this idea of the sacred cows become your future roadmap. It's like flipping it from here's the thing that we're all afraid of. No, this is not what we should be doing. I think that's really interesting and could be a lesson to people.

(00:32:20):
The other is just, I love this point you made about the growth was most accelerant when you're just focusing on the core, that's what actually ... Like optimize, people bash on optimizing the existing experience and just micro-optimizing, improving, versus trying to take all these big, bold bets and experiments. Obviously, that's also valuable. But I think it's really interesting that that's what reignited growth and was responsible for growth for a while.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:32:44):
And continue to be, by the way. One of the lines that we had to maneuver was creating a portfolio of bets where some of them were not speculative at all. We knew that if we continue to invest in ML and getting better with recommendations in the main feed and through notifications and things like improving the onboarding flow, it was rife with opportunity.

(00:33:12):
You'd have really dumb things happen. We would learn. There was one just bizarre and incredible meeting we had where we finally had got more rigorous around instrumenting our onboarding flow. And we found that in a couple countries, like we had a bug with our SMS verification flow where we wanted to verify users who were signing up with a phone number and our telco integration to send SMS verification cards just wasn't working. And so a huge percentage of people signing up in the UAE and other countries just couldn't use Twitter.

(00:33:46):
And so of course at the scale that we were operating in with hundreds of millions of users, you need to be able to refine the basic building blocks of the product, and that's going to lead to reliable growth. But we wanted to balance that with a portfolio of other bets and product improvements that would materially add new capabilities. And that was a balance that I don't think existed. And by the way, I don't think we nailed it either under my tenure, but it was the driving force of what I wanted to achieve, was to create a better balance that would result in evolving the product and introducing new capabilities. And so that's what we tried to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
In terms of what actually helped turn things around, things that I kind of gathered from what you shared so far, one is just building a little momentum, having some quick wins of new products that people start to get excited about. So creating more excitement down the, oh wow, we can actually try new things. There's also, it felt like there's a sense of trust that you built with Jack and execs of just like, okay, we can actually trust this team.

(00:34:47):
Also, it feels like because growth started up, there's probably a sense of like, okay, we can try some new crazy ideas. It feels like another part of your strategy was [inaudible 00:34:56] hires and bringing in these entrepreneurial folks to take the lead on some of these big ideas. Can you talk about that? Was that something you actively thought about and was that a big part of the impact there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:35:07):
Totally. Yeah. So I think a couple things. One, the only thing I'd add to what you said in terms of the ingredients, it was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once. I'm talking internally, by the way. There's a whole other component of this, which is externally how do you tell, especially for a product like Twitter where it's a consumer product that hundreds of millions of people are using, and you have many constituents, you have users, you have advertisers. And so it was very important for us to tell the story of here's what we're doing and why. Here's why you should believe in us. And by the way, give us all your constructive criticism too, because we're listening and we're going to build that into ... So that storytelling was really, really important.

(00:35:51):
And this is oversimplifying the world, but there's two types of internal team members. There are people who hear that story, who have been a part of the organization who's been slow, or maybe they've been outside the company as a user of Twitter, and they're like, I'd never really want to work there because it doesn't seem like a particularly ambitious product company. And one of two things happens when you hear that story. Either you're inspired and you're like, yeah, we can finally take a swing at making this product better. And maybe I wasn't interested in working in this company before, but I mean, this is an iconic product, and to have an opportunity to reshape it is really exciting. Or again, oversimplified world, but there are people who are very pessimistic and maybe aren't excited by that vision. Let's just stick to what we know works. We're not going to take any big swings. That's a waste of time.

(00:36:35):
I think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there. And that's something that we were terrible at, and we didn't have the organizational structure to be able to enact that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
The wagon is they're excited and bought into this vision and want this to happen?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:37:03):
Correct, and contribute towards it. And off the wagon is like you're not at the company. And we didn't have an organizational structure that could allow for that, nor frankly, the fortitude. I include myself in this. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to make that determination. So I think we were terrible at that. And Elon is the whatever, if that's a spectrum, Elon is the opposite spectrum of that. His tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low. And I think it's one of the things that when I say A/B test, it's very interesting to see the extreme to which he has operated.

(00:37:37):
And I think I've learned a ton around, we didn't have the organizational structure nor the fortitude to be swifter, and that made cultural change way slower. We still were able to change the culture, not as much as we should have, and certainly not as quickly as we should have or efficiently as we should have. Because by the way, a lot of high performers who are aligned with that desire to change and build, they don't have the, there's not like an equal distribution of patients. If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact. So it's very difficult.

(00:38:16):
But anyway, going to your question, one of the things we found that was a really effective way of accelerating cultural change and also helping drive some of these product initiatives that were particularly speculative was doing small acquires. And really the benefit of that was, A, you bring in a founder type who is an entrepreneur, who drives urgency, who has ambition, who's ideally savvy enough to also work in the context of a large organization, which sometimes is a totally different skillset. I mean, it is a totally different skillset. And a lot of our most ambitious bets that were the riskiest and most misaligned with how the product worked or there was no easy staff to build on top of, a lot of those bets were driven by founders who we basically acquired and said, "Here, you are going to run this."

(00:39:13):
And they believed in it. They were able to rally a team around them, and it's all the attributes of a startup, but with the canvas of a product that hundreds of millions of people use and more resources. So Spaces, Communities, Community Notes, called Birdwatch back then, these were all projects driven by ... Fleets, as well. These were all projects that were run by small teams led by entrepreneurs who we acquired, like Keith Coleman runs Community Notes, last Birdwatch. He actually was my predecessor. We acquired his company so that he could be the head of product. And then when he moved on from that role, he was extremely passionate about this idea of crowdsource moderation and letting people annotate misleading content on the platform without Twitter acting as a policeman.

(00:40:03):
And that was a very speculative bet that by the way, a lot of people thought, most people thought was a terrible idea. We gave Keith a little silo to go build this vision, and then it was our job to make sure that bet didn't get suffocated in the context of a big organization that would otherwise have not had patience for it.

(00:40:26):
All of the community effort or the creator efforts started with Super Follows and tipping, and all these things were led by Esther Crawford, whose company we acquired and who had her own couple of viral moments with the Elon acquisition. But she's a phenomenal leader who, again, is a perfect example of balancing that entrepreneurial startup muscle with the savviness to be able to get things done at a large organization. Fleets was run by Mo Oladam, who's an entrepreneur, and Communities has gone through a few iterations obviously and still is in the product, but John Barnett and a team of people who we acquired from Chroma Labs.

(00:41:02):
So I think that that story of acquiring hungry, ambitious founders and giving them responsibility and latitude is a success story of Twitter's. I mean, I'm a beneficiary of such a bet as well. My company Periscope was acquired, and I was given the responsibility to eventually lead the product team. So I feel like that we ended up realizing, both through the company's history and through learning, that this is actually a very effective way to drive cultural change and to deliver impact because you need a special type of person to be able to both operate within the existing structure and change the structure, to know when to use the system and to know when to fuck the system.

(00:41:52):
And I feel like my whole life has benefited from other people taking bets on me like that, to the point that even I was like, "Really? You sure you want to?" And so I think I've enjoyed trying to pass the buck and do that for other people, and I've never regretted it. You always, taking a bet on people and especially throwing them in a deep end, which on paper they may be unqualified for, I think is one of the best ways of driving change. And by the way, supporting growth, you've learned so much more when you're thrown into the deep end than in other contexts. And so I think it's fantastic, it's an expensive strategy if you're going to go buy a bunch of companies, but it's a great strategy for the situation that we found ourselves in at Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
It feels like every big bet was one of these companies from the list that you just shared, and I'm glad you shared Periscope, obviously. That's a great example, too. I guess maybe just a follow-up question here, is there anything you learned about how to do this well? I know you talked about maybe creating a little silo for the team, because so many companies acquire and acquihire and they just go nowhere.

(00:42:59):
So I guess just a two-part question, just like what are some tips for how to do this well at a company? And then, two, you also, we were talking offline about this previously and I think it's a really interesting point, that a lot of companies staff based on who's available versus who is right for the role, and let's wait until that person is there for us to bet on this. Can you just talk about lessons there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:43:19):
That last one is a huge pet peeve of mine that I feel like we learned the hard way, and particularly it's a common pattern I think in highly functional organizations where you have different people making decisions on how to staff projects, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I think in the situations, in the situation we found ourselves in where we had this sort of cultural evolution that we were going through where some people just didn't agree with the things that we were prioritizing, they were begrudgingly going along with it, but you would end up in a situation where the combination of that sort of cultural shift and strategy and the fact that the way teams were being staffed was not, there's ultimately no single decision maker other than the CEO and Jack is not going to get in the weeds and debate a staffing decision on the team, resulted in a situation where oftentimes we'd have projects, like the one I mentioned about hiding replies, where there wasn't even an agreement on the team about whether this was a good idea and whether this is worth trying or how to do it.

(00:44:22):
And imagine, it's hard enough to build something from nothing. It's even harder if the team doesn't believe in it. This is to the point of just being toxic. The startup would never succeed if all the people who are working on that startup aren't to the point of being perhaps irrational obsessed with that idea. And still willing to see truth, you need to be able to see whether the thing is working or not, but if you don't believe it in the first place, I'm not betting on that succeeding.

(00:44:50):
And so this was common, and sometimes not as extreme as the examples that I mentioned, but I think one of the lessons I learned, and it's quite intuitive actually, is you need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative. It's going to make them have the sufficient level of ambition and desire to will this thing into existence. Because every project, whether big or small, there is an element of you need to will this thing into existence because it's hard. The only way you're going to get through that pain is by having that desire, and I think a very easy cheat code for an organization to employ is to say, if you're going to work on something, especially if it's speculative or risky, staff it with a set of people who believe in it and really want to learn whether this solves a customer problem or not. Because if you don't have that ingredient, it's going to drag everyone down and it's just not going to be as successful.

This kind of touches on something I wanted to touch on, which is jobs-to-be-done. This is maybe one of the most recurring controversies of the podcast, is jobs-to-be-done amazing or is it really bad and not something you should do? We've had many guests share their opinions. I feel like at Twitter, jobs-to-be-done was implemented so strictly that it burned a lot of people out on it. It's like, oh my, this is not anything anyone should ever do. I'm curious, just your lessons and experience of just with frameworks in general, the jobs-to-be- done specifically, maybe even OKRs.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:47:31):
I've only seen one interview on your show that covers this. Sriram was particularly spicy when he talked about jobs-to-be-done, which is unsurprising because. I spent a lot of time talking to Sriram about jobs-to-be-done. I mean, I guess I'll just start by saying I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful, and so it's a particularly sore subject for me because I was sort of charged with defending it and rolling it out. It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something. But...

Kayvon Beykpour (00:48:00):
It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something, but to me the critique is less about Jobs-to-be-Done though there are many critiques of it and more about every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process. And that's what happened with Jobs-to-be-Done. So I think that's my real critique of it. It's not the... I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true alternatives are outside of the narrow lens of your product.

(00:48:47):
And I think that's just healthy product thinking. You don't need a framework called Jobs-to-be-Done. You don't need to think about milkshakes in order to be able to do that. It's like you could employ common sense or you could leverage something like Jobs-to-be-Done, to be able to force your mind to think of things through that lens. So I think that's my charitable view on what Jobs-to-be-Done can help you do, but as a framework into and of itself as a sole governing principle of what to build, it's just not useful.

(00:49:14):
By the way, in the same way as, and I think Twitter had this problem as well prior to our detour around Jobs-to-be-Done, if the only way the organization is trained to think about what to build and what not to build is OKRs, it's equally unhelpful at the limit because sure, you can have a good sense of what you should build to drive metrics, but by the way, you might be focusing on the wrong metrics or that might not help you have the right balance of things to build. That might not help you see when the things that you're building are actually hostile to customers.

(00:49:47):
So just as an interesting example, the thing that I remember about your interview with Shriram, if I'm not mistaken, I think he mentioned, and I love Shriram, I'd be happy to debate him about this on his podcast, but he mentioned one of the examples I think was the Amazon. When you get order confirmation from Amazon, they intentionally bury the order details. You have to click the link and authenticate to go see what you ordered. I don't give two shits what metrics that drive for Amazon. That is one of the most customer hostile things I experience in my daily life. I order a lot of things from Amazon. I hate the fact that I can't search my email to see what I ordered. And so I think the problem with these frameworks is that you lose nuance and ultimately, and this is where I agree with Shriram, he actually mentioned this on your podcast as well, you need to be able to make trade-off decisions that balance what's right for the organization and what's right for the customer.

(00:50:43):
And sometimes based on how you devise your frameworks, your metrics aren't actually aligned with the customer's benefit. Like the Amazon example, and we had many famous examples in Twitter's history, which were the same. One of our key metrics that we always optimized Shriram growing was DAU and we had obviously the rank timeline did wonders for growing DAU and it was a great experience for many customers, but we often had features that would not lead to a good customer experience and the team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics and aggregate. And the famous example of this is we had this toggle, which we called Swish very affectionately, but it was like a sparkle icon.

(00:51:26):
Before you could switch between the rank timeline and the following, that reverse chronological timeline, which is still in the product right now, it was just the toggle. You would press a button and it would turn your feed reverse chron, which very few people use as a percentage of our users. But you had power users who really cared about having a reverse chronological timeline and we took so many baby steps on the evolution of this product. The very first baby step was you press the toggle, it turns you to reverse chron and then we would pull the rug out from underneath you and make the experience go back to the rank timeline after, I don't know, 24 hours or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):
Oh, wow.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:52:03):
And the reason that the team felt strongly about keeping it this way is it was better for metrics. Why? Even if Lenny wants a reverse chron feed, we knew that he would spend more time in the app if we put them in the rank timeline and this was the number of debates that we had about this because the team understandably was like, "This is good for metrics", but at the same time you'd have customers being like, "I fucking hate this experience. I'm telling you I want reverse chron. Stop randomly changing it for me."

(00:52:34):
Instagram has I think gone through their own struggles with this as well. They tiptoed their way towards ultimately giving people control and the difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes. And sometimes those things are aligned and sometimes they're not, and the answer isn't any one framework. Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste. And so that's where my take is different. I don't think the issue is Jobs-to-be-Done, although I'm not the biggest fan of Jobs-to-be-Done. The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):
I think that's really important advice and I love hearing the details if I actually think about this stuff. Actually finding this balance is very hard in practice. I'm curious if there's something you could recommend or have learned about how to know when you've gone too far with a framework like signs like you have implemented this to religiously and maybe you should be thinking a little more broadly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:53:41):
There's two, I think, simple and obvious ones. One is if the result of your framework is that subjectively bad decisions are being made, then something's got to change. Assuming the person who's making this assessment has good product taste, which is in of itself subjective obviously, but my personal view on this would be in the role that I had, if I saw that our organization was being incentivized to make decisions that to some non-trivial degree of the time were just bad decisions that I don't like as a user, I can't stand by as a user or builder, then something's got to change. Either bad judgment was made in following the process or the process was wrong, or if that framework, it didn't even lead to the right debates, then that's how you know. Either you have an incentive problem but the team did what they were incentivized to do or that there was bad judgment and that's a different problem obviously.

(00:54:38):
But I think in the situation we found ourselves in where the team was again understandably hyper focused on driving DAU because that was the strategy for so long. It left so little room for even taking ambitious bets that in the short term wouldn't drive DAU, like some of our bets that I still to this day believe in hurt DAU in the short term, but you had to squint and believe over time would improve some metric DAU or otherwise, like a product like Spaces. In order for Spaces to be actually used, you needed to make sure that when Lenny starts a Space that people would join. And how do you get people to join Lenny space when they're used to having an asynchronous feed of tweets? Well, you can send push notifications, you can occupy really trying real estate at the top of the app that lets people know, "Hey, Lenny's live right now. He's in a space, there's people here, come join."

(00:55:31):
Guess what happens when you put a bar at the top of the app that tells people when they're live? You move tweets down, you move ads down, DAU goes down, revenue goes down. And so if you have an organization that's just hyper focused on the thing that matters is driving DAU quarter over quarter, then that doesn't leave enough room for nuance to accommodate new speculative bets that might hurt one metric, but over time have other consequences that are positive and beneficial, like enabling an entire new vector of content creation and conversation on the platform. I guess the other answer to your question in terms of how do you know when the framework's not serving you right? When you start imagining and planning for a bunch of bets that the organization then sees is disincentivized to make successful, then something's got to change.

(00:56:17):
Either your strategy is just not the right strategy because it doesn't abide by the frameworks or the framework needs to accommodate the fact that actually we're going to try some things that in the short term either might not show up as blips on our DAU radar or are going to help some other metric that's important. And so that took us some time to get, and we tried a variety of schemes to make that work. Community Notes, the project that I was mentioning Keith started, we intentionally structured that like a startup. It was literally like we made a seed bet on Keith and his team and we were like, don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs.

(00:56:57):
And there's some pros and cons to that. A lot of our projects worked that way. Fleets started that way. Community Notes started that way and some other projects started more part of the core organization because they were so intertwined with how we were the nature of the product that it just made sense to... Separating it was going to do more harm than good. So you just have to figure out based on how execution is going, whether you've got the right framework and you've got to be willing to make adjustments when it's not working.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That's actually really helpful. The two that I'm taking away here is how often are you feeling bad about the features you're shipping? Like they're bad for users and you think they're bad for you as a user potentially. And the other is it keeping you from taking big bold bets that don't necessarily drive the metrics you're focusing on. Okay, so before I let you go, I want to spend some time on Periscope. I don't know if everybody knows the history and story of Periscope. Basically it was the biggest live video streaming platform in the world and I imagine inspired basically every other social network to build a live-streaming platform, Instagram live, Facebook, TikTok, obviously Twitter. So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story with Kobe Bryant and Periscope about him using it in some form. Can you share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:58:18):
Before Periscope launched publicly, which it was in March of 2015, I want to say, we had a small beta that grew to maybe 500 people in total before we actually released the app publicly. And in that time while we were still in beta, I was trying to personally onboard every single user and I had a shtick that I did, which was we'd get them in the app and I would start a broadcast. We had a feature called Private Broadcasting that we basically built for this use case, which is someone joins, I'm going to go live and they're going to join and I'm going to show them how the app works. And we were spending a lot of time in our office, so Kobe, Chris Saka actually invited Kobe to the beta.

(00:58:59):
And so Chris connected us and I did a private broadcast and Kobe joins and I was like, it was like 10:00 PM in the office and my routine was like, let me just walk around the office talking through the mechanics of Periscope through the lens of this demo of like, "Hey, let me show you around the office and here's how the chat works and you can tap the screen to send hearts and if you want me to do something, go to the room over there, just type it in the chat and it'll come up."

(00:59:22):
And sort of showed one of the things that was unique about Periscope was it was a one to many broadcasts, but still low latency enough that it felt like a FaceTime so you could have the bidirectional communication between multiple viewers and a broadcaster. And so I was teaching him how to use the chat and showing him the office and he was playing with it and at one point through the end of the demo he posts a comment that was like, "Why the fuck would anyone want to watch someone else stream live?" And I remember my heart sank and I started fumbling through like, "Well, we think it's cool."

(01:00:03):
And before I could even get the words out, he posted like, "I'm just fucking with you, bro. This is incredible." And I just remember it was just such a surreal moment that has, I'll never forget, I mean Kobe's a legend obviously, but to have him essentially troll me while also putting a point on what was cool about the experience and that was bidirectional and something he commented on to cause the broadcaster to change their behavior or change the experience, it was a really ironic full circle of showing off how the product works. But yeah, it's one of my favorite early Periscope stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
Oh man, if I kept doing that, the manual onboarding, I'd be like, "Who's coming?" Just always worried that someone else fancy is going to join. You never know who Chris Saka is getting, who he's talking to. That's amazing. Okay, so it's been about 10 years, I believe, since you sold Periscope and about six years ish since you stopped running at as CEO, something like that. Now as I shared, every single platform basically is doing this. They added live video streaming. I'm curious if there's anything you learned about just competing with these major platforms.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:01:14):
Well, there's a few reasons why Periscope failed ultimately and why we shut down the app. Obviously Periscope, the technology and the mechanics still lives on because you can go live on Twitter, you can watch live broadcasts on Twitter, you can do audio conversations on Twitter and all of that is the Periscope stack. Still there, which is awesome that the legacy lives on in a different form factor. The reason that the Periscope app failed, it really comes down to a few things. One, we did not address the core problem that retention wasn't good. Our poor retention was mapped by just an incredible surge in top-line user growth. And for Periscope, it was interesting because every month or two we would blow up in a new market that would just bring along an incredible surge in usage.

(01:02:02):
We blew up in the US, we then blew up in France. We then blew up in Turkey. We then blew up in the Middle East and you had these incredible surges, but underneath that surge, the core product had retention issues and we ultimately just did not, we didn't spend enough time prioritizing, addressing those. And in fact, we shipped product changes that made those retention issues worse. Compounding that was the fact that one of the theses behind our acquisition, the Twitter acquisition, was that we would leverage the scale and the community and the product mechanics of Twitter to make the product grow faster and also become more durable. And I think that's connects to one of the reasons why I feel like one of my learnings and one of the things that we knew but just failed to execute on was that I still am very skeptical that there can be a consumer product that is just focused on live video, like a generalized synchronous live video application for short form video I don't think can be durable on its own. I think you have to surround that product with enough features and capabilities to allow a community and an ecosystem of users to be able to stay in touch with one another asynchronously and synchronously. This is why a lot of the other products that you mentioned that incorporate live capabilities and we're shameless about copying. What was working about Periscope, they're surrounded by a scaffolding that lets people also stay in touch with each other. Asynchronously Instagram, it's an asynchronous product that has synchronous features like live. Same with TikTok obviously. And I think we were in this position where it was a live only product.

(01:03:39):
You are connecting with your audience and having a great time when you're broadcasting live, but you're not using the product to keep in touch with that community when you're not broadcasting. How often throughout the day would you broadcast live from your phone? And mind you, this is different for products that are live. There are live consumer products that focus on a specific vertical like whatnot for selling or Twitch for gaming that have very different properties that make it more durable as a standalone live product. But Periscope was really in this consumer generalized live-streaming from a phone land, and I think it was just not durable to have the product be live only. And the time it took us to integrate with Twitter was way too long. And there was reasons for that that come down to just how distracted Twitter was with its own roadmap and refining the core and they just had other fish to fry basically.

(01:04:32):
And all of that leads us to competition because at some point Facebook woke up and decided this is cool and we need to go build this. And I obviously wasn't there on the inside, but legend has it, Mark says, "Hey, you 300 people, stop what you're doing. Go basically make live exist in our product as a first [inaudible 01:04:56] experience."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:04:57):
And if you have that level of organizational effort put on building something that by the way, you don't have to spend any time wondering what the product looks like, just go copy these features basically and make them work. And they did a lot of other savvy things too from a partnership standpoint. We had a lot of prominent streamers that ranged from influencer or just creative people that became known on Periscopes, all the way up to celebrities like Kevin Hart and others who were prolific Periscopers that Facebook just went and bought out.

(01:05:30):
They were just like, "Cool, we're going to pay you a bunch of money to stream exclusively with us." So they hit us from all sides. They had the entire company put their effort towards building live in a way that was cohesive in the core product first with Facebook and then Instagram and then also attacked it from the creator as well. And we were too slow and it was very painful to think about because it was like many other insights that Twitter had early. Twitter had the right insight, but botched the follow through. I'm not pointing fingers, I blame myself for that just as much, but there's a pattern where Twitter is really great at spotting meaningful consumer behavior changes. They spotted Vine and acquired Vine, botched it, spotted Periscope, botched it, spotted Instagram by the way, before Facebook tried to buy Instagram, Twitter was trying to buy Instagram, and there are other reasons why that didn't fall through, but it's interesting to me, it's one of the interesting aspects of Twitter's history.

(01:06:35):
They were phenomenal at spotting meaningful changes in consumer social behavior, and actually putting their money where their mouth is in terms of trying to follow through on bringing those bets in-house, but then botching the execution. And so that was one of the things that was really motivating for me when I was in my role leading product of Twitter was I didn't want to make that mistake and we didn't end as up buying anything like Vine or Periscope and keeping the product. We obviously bought lots of small acquirers, but we did obviously have a bit of a story with Clubhouse that ended up with us building Spaces and competing with them. But anyway, that was a long, rambly story. Hopefully that answered your question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):
Yeah, there's so many. Again, it's all these fractals of thought threads I want to follow and ask you about. Real quick on the Vine and Periscope point, I was going to ask this. Twitter, as you said, had the opportunity to win in video in so many ways. Vine was amazing, killing everyone, loved it, and then it's fades away. I guess, you already shared a lot of challenges Twitter had with executing, shipping, Secret Cows, things like that. Is there anything specific with video? Was it just like, oh, this is not actually a huge priority and we're just going to ride it for now and that's why it didn't work out? Or is there anything more that?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:07:53):
No, it's even more like pathetic than that 'cause I think Twitter did believe in video, but it made this classical mistake that we also unfortunately recreated with Periscope, which was they had the insight around short-run video, they bought Vine. They then competed with Vine internally. So Vine was a separate organization within Twitter, separate office obviously in New York and then Twitter rather than integrated holistically into the product and pour gasoline on it, they built a native Twitter video feature that was a different stack, different team. It became what you think of as Twitter video now. It's like the most simple active uploading video and all the professional video tools called Media Studio that let publishers like ESPN put content. All of that was basically built as a separate team, separate organization, separate product that was competing with Vine. You had two visions for short form video that were manifesting, and that's the quickest way for things to get messy.

(01:08:58):
And of course the separate startup team is going to get, you're not going to be able to make good on the vision of buying the company and integrating it in all the right ways if you compete with it internally. And we had a similar thing happen with Periscope. We were very focused on Periscope with separate organizations, separate structures, separate app. Periscope at the time primarily was focused on UGC live video. So user-generated content being streamed from a phone. Twitter then decided to get in the premium live video business very famously with acquiring rights to Thursday night football, the NFL. Guess what happened? We competed internally rather than have a cohesive technical and product vision for how to embrace live video across the spectrum of UGC and premium live video, Twitter put a separate team in charge of premium with a separate product, separate technology stack. And so you had two ways to manifest live video on the product. It was like UGC live video, which was awkwardly not even really implemented well with Twitter at the time. And then premium live video, which had totally different UX, total different team, totally different architecture. And by the way, the company put a tremendous amount of energy and investment in talking about Twitter being a place to watch the NFL. And meanwhile you had this burgeoning UGC ecosystem, so this was like we're making the same mistake all over again. Now, luckily in the Periscope case with a lot of persistence and impatience and table pounding, we eventually fixed that mistake, but we wasted a tremendous amount of time. It was just a lot of headbutting in politics and eventually it took us a lot of time to technically reintegrate things together and now it's clean and awesome, right?

(01:10:48):
ESPN can go live with behind the scenes content at Wimbledon and it's the same technology stack and the same user experience, the powers, Lenny going live from his iPhone. But I think that was one of the reasons why it was an example of failed execution that ended up wasting time, resources and just leading to a subpar product experience that other companies I think have avoided making such mistakes. Facebook being a prime example, as frustrated, I am with them as a competitor for having really taken over the use case for live video. Got to hand it to them, brilliant execution, have a lot of respect for them. So we made sure to not make that mistake moving forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
I imagine there was reason for that. Partly I imagine this calcification of just like, we can't get you done, we just need to start a new team and do this thing. I imagine it always comes from like, oh, this makes sense. And then you realize, okay, this was a terrible idea down the road.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:11:47):
Yeah, it's that and also leadership. When you don't have unified leadership around these things, you end up making decisions that are in conflict with one another. They're just need a highly opinionated person at the top that avoids that kind of messiness from a.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:01):
That kind of messiness from a product and engineering standpoint.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
You mentioned Clubhouse, so I think what's interesting is one, many people copy Periscope as a product. I don't know if you'll describe it as copying, but it feels like spaces very inspired by Clubhouse. Do you have just a current philosophy on when it makes sense to be super inspired by another product and build it into your existing product versus like, no, you should not do this?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:30):
I think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste. I think some of the people who copied Periscope did so in poor taste, can't blame them. I wouldn't have done it the same way, but it worked. So you can't say it's the wrong thing. I think that it's possible to take ideas in good taste and take ideas in poor taste.

(01:13:07):
And I think with Clubhouse, we actually had been working on audio. Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former Periscope team, that when we wound down Periscope, I felt very strongly that there was still something to the idea of synchronous conversations. Because one of the famous things that I think we botched with Periscope is that we always... Our dream and our vision for Periscope and how we talked about it was was a mechanism for teleportation. You could see through someone else's eyes and be teleported somewhere else. It was like that was the story we told ourselves. That was the thing that inspired Periscope. And to a certain extent, a lot of people did use the product for that way. You could go see what it was like someplace in the world where it was something amazing happening or civil unrest happening or some important moment happening with breaking news or otherwise.

(01:13:58):
But it turns out the vast majority of our users were not using Periscope that way. It wasn't a rear-facing camera experience where you were showing someone the world, the vast majority of people were using it to just talk to other people. They were bored or they were lonely and they wanted to just have a conversation with other people. And it turns out video and audio is a very interesting way of doing that that allows for more nuance, more long-form conversation, more in-depth conversation, especially in contracts to Twitter, which has mechanics to really incentivize quick, snappy broadcasts that don't lead to much depth. And so when we shut down Periscope, we were like, man, we really need to enable a new form of conversation on Twitter that has some of those properties. And so we had a team that was working on a project that we sort of code named Hydra. Hydra because there were multiple heads on this monster and those heads are participants in a conversation.

(01:14:54):
And so well before Clubhouse was on the map, we had many different iterations of both video and audio only experiences that just didn't feel right, weren't working right, but we felt like we were onto something. And when Clubhouse came on the map, it really re-centered, it put into focus a user experience that felt a lot more right and now give them complete credit for that. Paul and Rohan and that team did an exceptional job crafting an experience that really enabled that mechanic and that premise of enabling these longer form conversations to shine. And so we did shamelessly seek inspiration from what they had done and what had worked and we put our own spin on it. The execution of Spaces within Twitter I think has some similarities, but also really took advantage of the mechanics that you had available to you in Twitter. It's a different product. And so we took the ideas that we felt were shortcuts to making the experience work and then we put our own spin on it. And so I have no problems with what we did there.

(01:15:55):
And having had experienced the pain of not moving quickly enough with Vine from the outside and Periscope having lived that experience, we were not willing to not be the winner with this use case. It is one of the projects I'm most proud of that we worked on at Twitter because we were very radical in our execution. Hydra went from this tiny project that six people were working on that no one knew or care about to, we made Spaces as the number one priority of the company literally above any other project period. And we put a bunch of people on accelerating that product and making it come to life within Twitter. And a lot of that was having felt the pain and burn of fucking this up with Vine and Periscope. And so I'm really proud of our execution. And it was also really energizing. I hope for the company to see that, wow, we pulled that off. So yeah, it was good. It was nice to have that full circle experience and also nice that, personally, I love that aspects of Periscope continue living on within Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
I did not know that. That is extremely interesting. Speaking full circle, when I joined Clubhouse the first time, Paul was there introducing me to Clubhouse and exactly the way you described Periscope, so I feel like he drew some inspiration from you one step back.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:17:30):
Paul's amazing. I feel like we're kindred spirits and I could see... It was one of the things I love about that team is just you could just feel how palpable their excitement was and their passion was for what they were building. Another universe we could have worked together more closely, but I think what they built was incredible and we took inspiration from it for sure. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):
So you've built some of the most successful, most beloved, most used consumer products. You continue to help other founders with their product. I'm curious just if you have any advice for how to get better at building consumer products in terms of maybe craft a product, product sense. What have you learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer product?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:18:19):
The best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products. And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's just no replacement for that. It's such an effective way of honing your own taste and seeing what's superficial but not useful, what's ugly but useful, what's beautiful and useful. And you hone that by having practice and building muscle memory. And so I think there's not a lot of science to it, I think. I mean obviously science can help you become more effective at lots of things. But I feel like I've just always been very curious about trying new things. I'm a very hungry consumer of new things that people are building and I'm not quick to judge. I'll try it even if it seems dumb because sometimes things that seem dumb at the beginning become very meaningful.

(01:19:20):
And so it's always been a very helpful cheat code for me. And it's also just personally interesting. Every tool, even the silly ones, people put their heart and soul into it and it's like an expression of themselves and it's always interesting to see that, to see people's creations and to learn from them and see what you like, what you don't like and how you might create something of your own that borrows from that. So if I could give people any advice through the lens of what's worked for me, it's that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):
Speaking of trying new things, what are you up to these days?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:19:55):
I'm building something in the consumer space. I started the company with a couple of co-founders late last year. We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but hopefully you'll be hearing from us pretty soon. But it's really nice to be back building something again, particularly building something with a small team again after seeing the opposite extreme with a really large company. We've just talked about lots of large company things. But yeah, hopefully you'll be hearing about it soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Oh man, I think this is breaking news. So mysterious and exciting. Kayvon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:38):
No, no, I think we've covered quite a bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):
We have. We have indeed. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:46):
I'm going to take a sip of water and then I'll be ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):
Okay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:54):
I love reading sci-fi. I just feel like sci-fi and mystery books are so healthy for jogging the imagination. And so some of my favorite books are by Neal Stephenson, I love Cryptonomicon. I love Reamde. I love a book called Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which is more like a fantasy book, but I just love escaping reality and thinking about sci-fi, thinking about fantasy is just, it's helpful for the soul and helpful for the imagination. So those are some of my favorite reads because it helps me. I feel like in some weird circular or wandering way, it helps me be more creative and imaginative. And by the way, that's true outside of reading as well. Some of the content that has shaped me, I feel like and help motivate my curiosity and a lot of things I built is sci-fi TV, right? Star Trek is incredible. We used to use as a metaphor for what Periscope was, we would think about Star Trek. It'd be really cool to be able to teleport or get beamed somewhere else in the world and we're not smart enough to go build that device, but what's the closest approximation to that that we can realize through software? Live streaming. So I think that kind of literature or content has always been inspirational for me and I think getting that through books is really healthy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
On that note, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that's inspired you in addition to Star Trek back in the day?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:37):
I mean the most recent movie I saw in theaters was Dune Two, and it was incredible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):
I just saw that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:41):
It's insane. I also thought Oppenheimer was... I'm a huge Nolan fan. Oppenheimer was captivating. To have that level of high octane in a biopic consistently for two and a half hours is so hard to pull off. And I thought it was exceptional. TV shows we're watching Tokyo Vice right now, which I really like. I think one of the best TV shows I've watched recently, I mean Succession was amazing, but maybe I'll pull a less popular one, which is Devs also in the sci-fi realm. I think it was a Hulu show. But if you're interested in tech and AI and you want great acting in Nick Offerman, Devs is a pretty amazing show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):
I haven't heard of that. Have you seen 3 Body Problem yet, by the way? It feels like it's squarely in your wheelhouse.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:33):
I haven't seen it yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Okay.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:35):
And it's funny, some content people are talking about it so much that I kind of want to not watch it now because I feel like it's really hard for shows to live up to the hype when you're mid-hype cycle. So I haven't gone around to it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I know it's the type of show that I would love, but I just haven't gone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):
Okay, great. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates you're hiring?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:58):
The thing that I find is both very illustrative and helpful is just asking people to talk about something they worked on that failed and talk about something they built that succeeded as well. But I think you just learn a lot about self-reflection and their passions. But particularly their self-reflection. If they talk through something that they really cared deeply about that didn't work and why didn't it work? What were the takeaways? What did you learn from it? I think it teaches you about how willing people are to take risks. It tells you have they experienced failure, what they learned from failure. And so I think it's always, you just get to know someone really well. It ends up in a well-rounded understanding of a person, if you can dig into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):
Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:24:51):
I love Proplexity. It's really interesting to me how Proplexity is a product that fits in your life and replaces a product that is so ingrained in people's behavior, which is using Google search for some set of use cases. And it's just really incredible to me how quickly Proplexity took that over. It is very hard actually to rewire your muscle memory if you're used to using Google for searching for 15, 20 years or whatever. It was just amazing to me how quickly my go-to became Proplexity. And frankly, it's one of the only non-development tool AI products that actually has retained. A lot of people try and consumer AI products that just aren't really, haven't retained. But Proplexity is one that it's a daily driver for me. It's on my home screen and I love it. I'm very impressed by it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):
Also a huge fan.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:25:46):
Yeah. Here's a bias one, my wife is actually working on a startup called Particle, and they're the news experience with AI. And what I love about what they're doing is that for the first time they're like they've rethought what the form factor and the unit of content for news stories should be. Articles are a failed format, is my belief, and certainly their belief. And so they've really come up with an elegant and engaging experience for understanding what's happening in the world in a way that's purely powered by AI. And it's awesome. Again, hashtag biased husband, but it's amazing. It's in beta right now. You can sign up on the wait list. The URL is particlenews.ai. They're letting people in on beta. If you sign up, use coupon code hashtag #KayvonLenny. That's not a real code. But yeah, so that's amazing. So that would be my second pick.

(01:26:48):
I'll give you a non-software one, which is actually a board game that I ran into, that I was gifted actually for my birthday. And it's called Crokinole. Have you heard of this game called Crokinole?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
I have not.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:01):
So Crokinole is Canadian. I think it's a Canadian board game and it's amazing to me because I've never seen a game be captivating to all age ranges. I love it. I play with my friends. My parents over Christmas were obsessed with this game. My daughter loves. It's a physical game. You flick a puck, like shuffleboard style, but miniaturized with a totally different set of mechanics. And it was just like seeing this game captivate, people of all age ranges was mind-blowing to me and it's really fun. So maybe a curveball answer for you there, but I think those are some of the products that I've been really enjoying and appreciating lately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
These are awesome answers. What's the name of that game again? I'm going to-

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:48):
Crokinole.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:53):
Okay. I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):
C-R-O-K-I-N-O-L-E.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:59):
Great. I love the K in there. That makes it really fun. And by the way, I think it's also Particle.news looking at it. It's so cool. It's basically bullet points of news items and then it links to all the articles that have written about it. So it just summarizes, here's the things you need to know and it's beautiful.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:13):
Yeah, basically they consume and aggregate everything that's happening in the world by among other things, ingesting articles and then crafting these story modules through them that are summarized by AI. And then they let you actually interrogate the news and ask questions. So leveraging LLMs and tool calls, it's able to actually help you understand what's happening in the world. And they also are building a social layer as well. So it was very cool. I'll definitely get you in the beta.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):
This is actually amazing timing, because I was a huge fan of Artifact, the news app, and they're going away, so this is the next news app, so thanks for sharing that. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with people that you find useful in work or in life?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:57):
Something that definitely shaped my work ethic and how I work that came from my first boss actually. When I was 14, I had a summer job basically replacing and doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. So I would drive into San Francisco, my boss would pick me up in his truck, we'd go to big commercial buildings, hospitals, high rises, and we would take all the fire extinguishers in the building, hundreds of them to the garage, empty them, fill them, tag them, inspect them. And that was my first job. And I don't even remember if I was getting paid. I was probably getting paid very small amount, but it was just first work experience. And I remember there was this moment that I had finished dealing with my extinguishers and I was just sitting in his truck twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. And my boss came up to me and was like, when you've got nothing to do, sweep never sit around.

(01:29:57):
And it was so funny, it was just very tiny moment, but I've never ever forgotten that. When you got nothing to do sweep. And it had such a profound impact on my work ethic of there's always something you can be doing to move the ball forward and being productive and being impactful. And I'm so grateful that Fred, my boss, had that moment with me. It was like, I don't even think he understands how impactful that was, but it felt so much a life motto, but it definitely stuck with me and shaped how I work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:35):
I love that you shared that story. I found that quote and story in GQ Magazine turns out is where you talked about this and I was going to ask about it and I didn't and I'm glad you shared it because I love it.

(01:30:47):
Final question, we're going to go full circle. Scott Belsky, you're friends with him. What's something people would be surprised about or don't know about Scott, that might be interesting?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:30:58):
Well, I'll tell you one funny story and then I'll first tell you something I love about Scott. Scott is a great example of someone who I think has driven immense cultural change at a massive, legendary company in Adobe obviously. But the number of transformations that Scott oversaw and led and contributed to at Adobe are incredible. And I'm sure having a fraction of this experience at Twitter, I can appreciate how difficult and challenging and rewarding that was, right? Going from package software to cloud, going from non-AI to AI, going from discrete tools to an integrated suite that worked really elegantly together. I think Scott oversaw a lot of this stuff and it's pretty incredible to see that transformation have been so successful at Adobe. So I love that.

(01:31:55):
I guess a funny story about Scott that people might not know, I consider him to have been the first Periscoper. So Scott believed in Periscope before it was Periscope, before we had turned it into live video, we had a previous version of our beta that was static photo sharing, same vision, same concept, but the product was called Bounty. And it was like you put a pin somewhere in the world like the Tokyo fish market and someone would respond with a photo of what it looked like there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:25):
I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:32:26):
Our vision was still to help you see through someone else's eyes, but the first manifestation was really static and had this marketplace dynamic, and it took us a while to get to the point where we were like, press a button, go live and have it be live video because by definition it's real time rather than static.

(01:32:42):
Anyways, before we built any of that, when we were playing with the idea and Scott was encouraging us to go in this direction, I remember probably the second time I ever met Scott, we did it FaceTime and he was at the TED conference, I want to say it was in Vancouver, and just to illustrate how cool it would be when he accepted the FaceTime and he's like, "Cool, and I'm going to take you on a Periscope." And he flipped this camera and started walking around the TED conference and basically pretending like he was prototyping the product, but using FaceTime. And it was such an amazing experience because having an investor essentially encourage you down a product direction by showing rather than telling, it was such a great encapsulation of how supportive Scott was and inspiring Scott was as one of our cheerleaders. And I respect him so much for everything he did to help Periscope make happen, and also for betting on us, because he was one of the first people who said yes to investing. He didn't know us, he just believed in us. And that helped everything else come together. And yeah, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):
We've got to get him back on the podcast. The story reminds me of your Elon's story, where he FaceTimed you, and it also makes me think about your lesson of building consumer products, just using it, being obsessed with it, Scott, just like, here's what it could look like. And actually using the product, not just talking about.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:04):
Yeah, he's a great example of that as well. He's definitely a gracious user of all tools and products, and that's why he has really great, really great product sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):
Kayvon, you're amazing. This was so freaking fascinating. There's so many nuggets here. Can't wait for folks to hear this.

(01:34:20):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and maybe follow up on anything if there's things you want to follow up on potentially? And then, how can listeners be useful to you?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:30):
People can find me on Twitter/X/whatever we're calling it these days. My handle is @kayvz, K-A-Y-V-Z. And yeah, if you're of this podcast and you're working on something cool and you need some help or advice or you're looking for an angel investor, don't hesitate to reach out and would love to try what you're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:51):
Amazing. And also check out Particle.news.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:53):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:54):
Support the wife.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:55):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:56):
Amazing. All right, Kayvon, thank you so much for being here.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:59):
Thanks Lenny. Great to meet you.

# An inside look at X’s Community Notes | Keith Coleman & Jay Baxter

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes.

Keith Coleman (00:00:09):
Someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note.

Jay Baxter (00:00:18):
We actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past. And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well- written, really, overall.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
There's many people that are very polarized. How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6?

Keith Coleman (00:00:36):
One philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate and sometimes people are surprised by that. We have all of humanity. We then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. Every post is eligible for notes. We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should be like everyone... Even advertisers can get notes.

Jay Baxter (00:00:58):
There have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a post with or without a Community Note, that actually people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with a note versus without.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):
Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:01:18):
If I were to start a company in that company, it would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group and I think because of a small group-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guests are Keith Coleman, Product Lead for Community Notes, and Jay Baxter, Founding ML Engineer and Researcher for Community Notes. This conversation may be my newest favorite podcast episode so far. Community Notes is one of the most impactful and clever and, also, underappreciated products in the world right now.

(00:01:52):
If you ever use X/Twitter and you see a note underneath a tweet correcting the misinformation in that tweet, that is Community Notes. I've never heard a deep dive into the story behind the product and the team that built it and I'm excited to bring you just that. We get into the surprising origin story of the product, how the algorithm actually works, how the algorithm emerged out of an internal contest within Twitter, the principles behind Community Notes, and why staying true to them has been so key to its success. Also, how it survived four different leaders, including Elon and Jack, and why it's now a big part of the solution to solving misinformation on the internet. Including recently being adopted by Meta as their main fact-checking tool. This is an incredibly special episode and I'm so excited to bring it to you.

Keith and Jay, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Keith Coleman (00:05:23):
It's great to be here. [inaudible 00:05:25].

Jay Baxter (00:05:25):
Thanks for having us on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):
It's so my pleasure. I'm so thrilled to be having this conversation. The work that you guys do has had such a tremendous impact on the way the world works. So many product teams are always talking about driving impact and want to drive impact. You guys have actually built things that have changed the world in meaningful ways and continue to do that. And I've never really heard the backstory of how Community Notes came to be and how it works and all these things, so I'm really appreciative of you guys making time to chat.

Keith Coleman (00:05:52):
Yeah. First, thanks for saying that. That's why we built this thing is to help people and it's great to hear it. It's great to see people enjoying it and finding it useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:02):
I want to start with just giving people a brief understanding of what is Community Notes. I think a lot of people kind of heard about it, kind of maybe see it on X. As they scroll through, they see these notes but they're like, "I don't actually know what this is." So can you just briefly describe what is Community Notes?

Keith Coleman (00:06:18):
Community Notes is a way for the people, like the public, to add context to posts that might be misleading. The basic way it works is that someone on X can see a post. If they think it's misleading, they can propose a note that they think other people might find informative. Other people can then rate that note. And if the note is found helpful by people who normally disagree with each other, indicating that it's probably accurate, it's probably really neutrally-worded, it's probably informative, then it will show to everyone on X. The goal is just to get people more information about what they're seeing so they can make better decisions in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:57):
Amazing, and I think hearing this, it's absurd that this works. I think when people originally heard this idea like, "No way this is going to work." And so, just to dive a little bit deeper, can you give us a deeper understanding of how it actually works? Because I think it's the algorithm that you guys designed that is so clever that allowed this to work. So talk a little bit about that algorithm.

Jay Baxter (00:07:22):
Yeah. So I think a key misunderstanding a lot of people have if they haven't really dived into details, they just think that maybe someone can write a note and it appears immediately or we're just taking a majority rules vote of who thinks the note's good. I think both of those approaches would probably lead to biased or inaccurate notes. I think the key thing, really, that we do is we actually look for agreement from people who have disagreed in the past.

(00:07:48):
And what we see is when people actually have that sort of surprising agreement, that's what makes the notes so neutral and accurate and well-written, really, overall. It's just that people who are very polarized, overall, often can't find agreement when things aren't accurate, right? I think it also provides some good anti-manipulation properties. I think people are often... If you said... I think back in 2020 before we started building anything here, whether this could work at all, I think a room of ML engineers would say, "Oh, you have to keep it closed source. People are going to be manipulating this all the time. You have to use ground truth labels from fact checkers. There's no way that you could bootstrap the system without external labels." But it turns out that you can do that with this kind of bridging-based agreement algorithm is what we call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:41):
Okay. So just to summarize and make it super clear. It's basically people... Someone writes a note. This information is fault... What's a good example, just as we talk about this, like a classic example?

Keith Coleman (00:08:50):
A really classic example is an AI generated image or an out of context image like, "Look what's happening here." But it's actually from five years ago in a different country and a different topic or something-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):
Oh, man. I've seen this so many times where it's like, "Look what's happening in San Francisco," and I'm like, "No, this is a whole different city and that's not-"

Keith Coleman (00:09:06):
Totally. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
Yeah. Okay. So someone posts this AI image. Someone writes a note, "This is actually five years ago in a different city," and this algorithm helps understand if this note is true and it's just regular people doing this.

Jay Baxter (00:09:23):
Yep. Regular people who have signed up to be Community Notes contributors. So there are a few checks, like you do have to have a verified phone number for instance. But yeah, at the end of the day, these are regular people. Not necessarily professional fact checkers or anything like that.

Keith Coleman (00:09:40):
And yeah, that was really important to us too. There was a question at the beginning, to the point Jay was making of like, "Did anyone think this was going to work?" Obviously, it was a crazy idea. We didn't know if regular people were going to be able to do this task and certainly people had concerns about whether they would do it effectively.

(00:09:58):
Initially, some people inside the company were suggesting like, "Hey, why don't you have journalists or some select group be the first participants?" But very specifically we were like, "No. We're trying to move away from the idea of curated editorial decisions being made around this. This is supposed to be open to everyone." So we very intentionally try to allow all humans in. People are randomly selected and that's important to it feeling fair, feeling open, feeling trustable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):
Yeah. And again, it's just like this sounds like the holy grail of understanding what is true and it actually works. And works so well that Meta recently, as you all know, decided to adopt this exact system for them instead of having tens of thousands of fact checkers reviewing things.

Jay Baxter (00:10:46):
One distinction that I would make, which maybe can come off as nitpicky but I think is important, is Community Notes adds additional context. It's not fact-checking necessarily, right? So there are cases where the post could be true. But maybe, it's just misleading because there there's no context or there's missing context. We cover those cases and I think that's an important distinction. We just have the philosophy that users should be able to make up their own minds, right? Like, "Here's extra context, take it or leave it," right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):
Yeah. What I think about, you shared this with me, this example of a picture with a cat and somebody's Community Note was just, "That's a dog." Or is it the other way around or that's a-

Jay Baxter (00:11:31):
Yeah. "A Palestinian boy shares his bread with a dog," was the post and it's a picture of this cat. So obviously, this particular note is not super necessary because it just says, "That's a cat," and links to a Wikipedia for cat. It's a good example that the system is... This is not something a professional fact-checker or whatever or you think would need fact-checking. But it's proof that the system is really run by the users at the end of the day and adds some comic relief, I guess. And the note is correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:06):
Okay. It's important.

Jay Baxter (00:12:08):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:08):
When does a post get triggered to even be considered for Community Note? Is there a threshold or is it just you can write a Community Note on anything and people decide what they would vote on? How does that work?

Keith Coleman (00:12:19):
So every post is eligible for notes and that was, again, another really important principle. It's like, "We shouldn't exempt Elon. We shouldn't exempt government figures. We should..." Everyone, even advertisers, can get notes. So any posts on the platform can get a note. And if you look in practice, you'll see notes appearing on world leaders, on Elon, on ads, on media organizations, and on, obviously, just regular people using social media. But yeah, the idea is really that it's an even playing field. For a note to be proposed, the person proposing it has to have earned the ability to write notes. So there is that aspect where you have to earn in to be able to do this. And the way you earn that ability is through your ratings by demonstrating the ability to help identify notes that are found helpful to a broad range of people. So basically, if you have an ability to see and know, recognize what's helpful with a lot of people, then you have the ability to start proposing notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):
I actually signed up to be on... What do you call these people? Note take-

Jay Baxter (00:13:24):
Contributors.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:25):
Okay. Contributors. Yeah. So I've been rating. I haven't achieved-

Keith Coleman (00:13:29):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
I can't write notes yet.

Keith Coleman (00:13:30):
Yeah. It's not super easy. It takes some effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:33):
Are there stats you can share about the scale of Community Notes at this point, especially things that might surprise people?

Keith Coleman (00:13:39):
Yeah. I mean, the service is growing rapidly, so there are hundreds of notes per day. And to put that into context, I saw some stats recently from someone at UC Berkeley saying there was something like 10 traditional fact checks a day. So in contrast, there's hundreds of notes a day that are getting shown. They span a huge range of topics from, obviously, politics, news, out to entertainment, sports, gaming. Just whatever is going on that day.

(00:14:07):
In addition to there being hundreds of these individual notes, they can also be matched to multiple posts. So if someone writes a note on an image or a video, like let's say it's AI generated or something like that, that note will automatically be matched to all posts that contain the same image. So you can have a single note matching to thousands of posts. And over let's say the last year, 2024, we had something like 95,000 notes that were seen about 30 billion times. That's more than double the prior year. Prior year was something like 37K notes seen 14 billion times. So that rate is increasing dramatically when you think about 30 billion views, that's a lot of information that is getting out there that might not have been out there otherwise, which is pretty cool. And part of the reason it is expanding like that is the contributor base is expanding. There's something like 950,000 contributors around the world. That's nearing a million people making this happen which is amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):
Wow. And I'm one of those, right? I count as a contributor?

Keith Coleman (00:15:15):
Yeah. Yep. No. If you're signed up as a contributor, you count.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
Okay. Cool.

Jay Baxter (00:15:18):
Then, there's more people on the waitlist too. So there's plenty of headroom for more growth. Regarding the matching on media and URLs, I think that's a huge way to get extra coverage. Also, I do think we've been very careful to make sure that those matches are precise. Because I think one thing that people love about Community Notes compared to other types of fact checking is that, actually, the notes are custom written for the particular claim you're seeing, right? So often, a fact check warning would just say something like, "Get the facts here." And then, there's a link to some generic page about voting information, which is so not helpful to have the information behind a click. So pulling the context up so that you have zero clicks that you need to make and keeping it specific is so important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):
One feature I love that I imagine you guys thought deeply about is if I liked the post in the past, I get notified later if a community note shows up, so that I'm not remembering this false information.

Keith Coleman (00:16:22):
Yeah. I mean, we try to make notes as fast as we can, so we want them to appear instantly if possible. But inevitably, there's going to be a time gap between when a post goes live and when people figure out what's going on and when they get the note out there. And so, we send those notifications to try to close that gap. And yeah, we get a lot of love for that. We see people take screenshots and share them. They're excited about it. And it's also a pretty cool example of something you can do on the internet, in the social media world that was difficult in a print or standard news world where you would see maybe a correction the next day in a corner of a paper that was hard to read. Here, you're getting a ping about it if you've engaged with a post and note shows up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:05):
One user feedback point is I'd love the push to just tell me, "Here's what you got wrong." Because I find that I actually have to go into it and read it and I feel like the push could just be like, "Here's more context to this thing." You're like-

Jay Baxter (00:17:20):
Agreed.

Keith Coleman (00:17:20):
We'll go take a look at that-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:21):
There we go. Live user feedback.

Keith Coleman (00:17:24):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):
Okay. I want to get into the origin story of this whole thing. But two more questions, because we're on this thread. One is what's the the threshold for a note to show up on a note? Is that information you can share, just how does that work?

Jay Baxter (00:17:35):
So just because of the details of the way the algorithm works, it uses this machine learning algorithm called Matrix factorization where we fit it with Gradient Descent and whatnot. The threshold is it's 0.4 on this made up scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:52):
0.4. Great.

Jay Baxter (00:17:53):
Yeah. I mean, in practice, what it means is basically a majority of people... If there is a polarized divide relevant to the notes. Obviously, some notes are not about politics or something polarizing. But if there is, then a sizable majority of people on both sides would generally need to find the note helpful. And then, there are other rules that come into play beyond that main one. So even if it's above that threshold, it might get filtered out if... There's a separate algorithm that's looking at agreement between people's incorrect tags. So like maybe people found the note helpful but incorrect, right? It happens. And in those cases, it doesn't matter if it's above the helpfulness threshold.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):
This is probably the wrong way to think about it, but is it 40% of people that normally disagree, agree-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
Okay. It's-

Jay Baxter (00:18:45):
It means nothing like that. It's just like on some arbitrary scale-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:48):
Okay.

Jay Baxter (00:18:48):
Yeah.

Keith Coleman (00:18:49):
Yeah. If we change random other things about the algorithm, that number would also have to change to an equally seemingly arbitrary number. We arrived at some numbers like that by gauging user feedback. So we could share a lot of notes with people, get feedback on which ones are helpful, and just a line emerged about indicating where things go from questionable to pretty clearly helpful.

Jay Baxter (00:19:13):
Yeah. And it is set right now, by the way, to be really conservative, I think. We just are pretty particular about quality and we really want note quality to be really high. I think Keith and I both believe that we live or die based on the quality of the notes at the end of the day. So we'd rather not show a note that maybe good, but we didn't have enough signal on than the other way around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
That makes so much sense. I've never seen a Community Note that is wrong and breaking that promise is a big deal. So I completely get why you guys are super conservative there. Okay. Two more questions [inaudible 00:19:53] because I'm just curious. These weren't on my list of questions to ask, but I feel like people wonder this. How many notes are written versus end up showing up and triggering on a-

Keith Coleman (00:20:02):
We probably show about 8% of notes that get proposed. It's been between, let's say, 7% and 10% or 11%, something like that over time. The number can vary a little bit. And as Jay said, there are undoubtedly... And you can see it, there's clearly more good notes than we show, but the goal is to hold a really high bar. We want to show a note when it's going to be helpful, when it's not going to appear biased and undermine trust in the system. We want these to be neutral, informative, helpful. And as Jay was saying, we view the worst possible mistake as showing a bad note because that's going to undermine trust and the trust is why people like the product.

(00:20:47):
So yeah, the bar is there. And like I said, there's clearly some in that remaining, let's call it 90%, that are good. And then, there's a lot that are just not that great and there's some that are bad. And if you write one of these ones that are bad which bad being defined as people who normally disagree find the note not helpful, so it's like the inverse of the ones we show. If you write one that people normally disagree, find not helpful, you actually will ultimately lose your ability to write and have to earn it back. That other 90% is a mix. Sometimes people look at the number, they're like, "Oh, why don't you show more?" It's like, "Well, you probably actually don't really want us showing most of those." The gold here is that the system is able to filter out the good ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
That makes sense. Okay. One other question is there's many people that are very polarized, like very disagreeable with a lot of things. How do they filter into this algorithm? How do you deal with people that are super anti-vax, super Jan 6, like all these very extreme potential views?

Jay Baxter (00:21:47):
If people really are so polarized that there isn't agreement among people that typically disagree, it's possible that this is one of those notes that might be correct, but it wouldn't be helpful to show as context. Maybe it's about a claim that people have really entrenched opinions about and they've read hundreds of things about it already.

(00:22:15):
Probably this is just not going to improve people's understanding. It's just not going to be a helpful user experience. So it might not be the worst thing in those cases to not show the note. People, a few years ago, were pretty pessimistic that maybe fact-checking never changes people's understandings about what's true. Actually, there have been external studies run by people totally independent of us who have found that if you take a community note or posts with or without a community note... That actually, people's agreement with the core claims in the post does change if they see it with the note versus without. So we are having an impact on this thing that people previously thought was maybe not so easy to do.

(00:22:59):
And so, it's nice to focus on the cases where there is the bridging agreement. I would also say there is this reputation component to the algorithm as well. So if you consistently rate notes in a way that is counter to the bridging-based consensus, then we will stop counting your ratings. So if you're the kind of person who constantly rates bad notes as helpful, we do filter you out. So there's a difference between those types of people versus the good but polarized ones.

Keith Coleman (00:23:30):
Yeah. I think one philosophical thing that's important is that we want all of humanity to participate. And sometimes, people are surprised by that. They'll be like, "Oh, aren't there people who shouldn't be doing this?", or like, "Their thinking is so extreme or something, maybe they shouldn't participate." But our view is it's actually we want to have all of humanity here. Because if we have all of humanity, we then have the data to understand what notes will be helpful to actual humanity. We can better model that better or better understand and better show those notes.

(00:24:03):
So it's advantageous to have people who have all sorts of points of views and we don't expect that every note will be loved by every single person. That's an impossible bar. But we do intend to show the notes that 80% of people are going to read and say, "Wow. I'm glad I knew that." And so, in that sense, it doesn't matter how maybe extreme someone views a person's views as. It's still great to have them in the program. So no matter what your views are, please sign up and participate. It helps identify what's really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
Cool. And we'll link to people if they want to actually sign up, so they know how to do this. Something we didn't actually specify, these are all volunteers. No one's getting paid to be doing these notes and voting, right?

Keith Coleman (00:24:49):
Yeah. It's totally based on intrinsic motivation and we think that's a great reason to be doing it. When you talk to the most active contributors, a lot of them, they want to have better information out in the world and that's a great motivation. So yeah, that's why they... If you think about, like for these people, the impact they can have is nuts. So when we first launched US-wide, this was like in 2022, a note appeared on a White House tweet and the White House deleted the tweet and reissued an updated statement.

(00:25:25):
Imagine being the person who wrote that. You probably have 12 followers. Your posts probably get a couple likes. And here, you just put a note on the White House and they changed their public talking points based on what you did. That is an incredible amount of impact. So you could see why people are motivated to do it when they care about what's going on in the world. You don't have to be a big, well-known person to shape the discourse and information flow in a way that's helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):
It's insane. There's so much to love about this. One is just the meritocracy of this whole operation of just anybody that is true and correct can participate and have impact. Also, it just shows you how much information we get that is just wrong. We had no idea how often we see things that are wrong and now we do.

Keith Coleman (00:26:18):
Working on this product has made me realize just how many things I used to trust by default, that now I look at more skeptically.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:26):
Definitely mean these days. Okay. Before we get to the origin story, is there anything else along those lines you guys think might be really important to share, that are really interesting?

Jay Baxter (00:26:36):
Sure. I guess one other thing is that although we don't actually use the fact that a post was noted in the core ranking algorithm, which we think is a nice property. There is a really big impact just organically, meaning not from the algorithm but just from user behavior, where people will like and re-share or quote posts way less when-

Jay Baxter (00:27:00):
Quote. Posts way less when notes are applied. I don't know, for people out there who typically run A-B tests on big platforms, you may already be familiar with this, but 1% is typically an awesome effect size for any algorithm change. We saw more like 30 to 40% engagement rate drops for likes and reposts in A-B tests we were ran when showing a post with or without a note, which is just crazy big. That's just an A-B test on the engagement rate, so that's not the network effect. If you capture the overall network effect of how post spread less by that person's repost, basically if you look top line with a difference in differences approach, multiple different external research groups have both found consistently that there's a 50 or 60% drop in total reposts, which is just nuts after a note is applied. It's having a really big impact on spread actually, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
That's so great to hear. It's what I would want to see and it's incredible impact. Basically, an AI image of something false would just go crazy on Twitter, and did before Community Notes came out, and now what you're saying is just adding that context, not actually... Like you're saying, the algorithm doesn't demote it. If there's something incorrect, it's just people are like, "Okay, this is false, why would I want to retweet this?" That makes sense.

Keith Coleman (00:28:28):
Correct.

Jay Baxter (00:28:29):
Right.

Keith Coleman (00:28:29):
Yeah, the notes just totally take the wind out these stories. The thing will be going viral, note appears, resharing drops 50 to 60%, and that's it. At 50 to 60% per generation, the virality quickly goes to zero.

Jay Baxter (00:28:45):
By the way, I have very mixed feelings about this next one, but authors become 80% more likely to decrease, sorry, to delete their post after they get noted, which okay, that's great, because less misinfo out there, but I'm pan about, because those are usually the best notes. If the note was so just good that you had no other option but to delete your post, those notes don't get seen by other people, right? Because-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:13):
That's hard.

Jay Baxter (00:29:14):
There's an argument, by the way, that seeing... Just because you might see the same misleading claim elsewhere off X, or somewhere else on X, it might be good to actually show... Better to have seen the post with the note than not see it at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:28):
Yeah.

Jay Baxter (00:29:29):
Unsure about that claim.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
That is so interesting.

Jay Baxter (00:29:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
Yeah, I'd be so sad if I was that community note writer and just... Man, it's so good. They just can't even keep the post up. Okay. Coming back from today's world, where this small amount of code is changing the way people understand the world and what they believe, and making the White House rescind their announcements, zooming back to the beginning of how this whole project started, what I heard just briefly is, Keith, you were just tired of managing PMs, you wanted to just work on something yourself, you wanted to work on something impactful away from corporate BS, and you basically just started looking for something that was impactful, important, and you found this. Talk about just how it all came to be at the beginnings of the story.

Keith Coleman (00:30:19):
Yeah. I mean, for me, the beginnings actually go back to why I joined, it was then, Twitter in 2016. I had a startup and we'd had some acquisition offers, and one of them was from this company, Twitter. It was 2016, it was the middle of the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and there were something like three televised debates, but every day, there was a debate happening on Twitter, and it was very clear, this is where people are talking about these things that matter, where information is being shared, where ideas are being formed. As a user, it was obvious that I could get good information there, but it was also obvious that there was questionable information floating around. I remember just looking, as an outsider, thinking like, "Wow, this is a really hard problem and it also seems really important," so we ended up going to Twitter and the company was in a turnaround at that point.

(00:31:21):
My first three years was just helping to get the company growing again, working on everything that was the consumer product, getting user growth going back and people wanting to work there again, et cetera, but a few years in, I was reflecting on what we had done. I think we had done a lot of good work getting momentum going, and people in the us and in the industry had tried things to deal with misleading information, but nothing was really working. It was obvious nothing was working. Nothing could handle the scale of the problem, nothing could handle the speed, and a lot of people just didn't trust the existing approaches. The existing approaches were either fact-checkers or internal trust and safety teams making decisions about what was or was not misleading. A lot of people just didn't want or trust that to be the way this was decided, which is very reasonable.

(00:32:19):
I'm looking at that, I was still managing a large PM team. That's a whole story in itself. That job required a lot of energy in, and I didn't feel like I always saw the output that I wanted to see from it. I didn't see the change in the product I wanted to see and I was contemplating, "Should I go start a company? Should I do something else?" And I kept coming back to this problem. I'm like, "Man, how is the world going to deal with this information quality issue of what we get on social media?" Wherever get it. I'm at this company where you can make a difference on this problem, why not go and try some crazy ideas and see if one of them might work? I had a kid, I came back from paternity leave, I went to my boss, Kayvon. I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. How about I just stop doing my job and I go work on this instead? 'This' being trying some crazy ideas to see if we can deal with misleading info."

(00:33:24):
He was stoked, so I went off and started working on that. It started with just reading any research I could on the problem and existing solutions. What was or was not working, what were the issues, and then into prototyping. Then it ultimately led to us building and piloting this idea that became Community Notes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):
Amazing. I have so many questions and we're going to keep going through the story, but when you joined Twitter, what was the... It was called Twitter. At this point, I'm going to try to call it X now, which I know is important to your boss. What era of Twitter was it at that point? It was Kayvon joined and who was the CEO? Because there's been many.

Keith Coleman (00:34:05):
Okay, yeah. I came in December 2016, so Jack had relatively recently come back as CEO to turn the company around, and just to give you a sense of the state of the company, something like a third of employees were leaving every year. Just imagine a third of your team gone every year. The stock was in the toilet, the product was not really growing, so Jack was working on a turnaround and Kayvon was there already. Kayvon was running Periscope with a bunch of video stuff, and that group continued to... Jack was there up through the start of the Community Notes, then Birdwatch Project, and... Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):
Okay, and it was called Birdwatch. I don't think we've used that term yet, but that's an important point. It was called Birdwatch initially.

Keith Coleman (00:34:55):
Yeah. It was originally called Birdwatch when we started the project, but obviously, somewhat famously the name changed along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:05):
Yeah, maybe let's just tell that story real quick, and I know we're zooming it forward, but just... I have this Twitter thread that I saw between Jack and Elon when they're debating what to call it, and Elon's like, "Birdwatch sounds creepy, I want to change it". Is there anything there you can share?

Keith Coleman (00:35:19):
Yeah, the story there... The story, that's funny. Elon came in, acquired the company, and we had just launched the product relatively recently in the US. It had been in pilot for a year, but we had just made it available US-wide, and I guess he'd been seeing the notes. Soon after the exhibition, he DM'd me and he was like, "Hey, this Community Notes thing is awesome," and I was like, "I'm glad you like it, let's talk," so we talked the next day and he kept referring to it as "This Community Notes thing." I was like, "It's interesting you keep calling it that, because that's actually the very first thing that I called it." The very first figma mockup I made depicting this thing was called "Community Notes." I don't know why, it just felt really natural, so that's the first prototype we had tested.

(00:36:14):
Later, the project changed the same to Birdwatch, but Elon was like, "Hey, let's just call it that." The next day, we just changed the name. It's always notable for the team when you change the name, but really, the team was excited about it. I think it is a much more understandable name. Jack has made fun of it, calling it "The ultimate Facebook name," or something like that.

Jay Baxter (00:36:41):
The most boring Facebook name [inaudible 00:36:44].

Keith Coleman (00:36:44):
Boring name, which is funny, because they're now launching Community Notes. I think it is a very understandable, intuitive name, and I think it has served the product really well. There's a reason it was the name in the very first mockup.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:57):
Yeah, I think descriptive names just makes sense. This connection with Elon, and I want to talk later about just how you've dealt with so many strong personalities over and kept this alive throughout so many changes, but before we get to that, you did something that I think a lot of product leaders, angel leaders, just people that have managed people dream of give up all this power, in air quotes, and career trajectory and influence and just, "Forget all that. I'm going to go back to just building something awesome, small team." Is there any advice there that you could share from that experience that you think might be helpful for other leaders to share or to hear to help them maybe do that same jump? Because that's really difficult in practice. Easy to talk about, hard to do.

Keith Coleman (00:37:42):
Yeah, I think it is a difficult jump. I've done it a bunch of times in my career and I've always been very happy with it, where I started with a small team, that it grew into something bigger, and then I was like, "We're dealing with a lot of big production stuff, team's really big. I want to go back to doing something like crazy and new with a small team again." I've done that sawtooth leap a bunch of times, but it can be hard, because certainly, the natural... The classic career path is, I don't know, rewards or running a large organization or being a manager, or things like that, but I think, at the end of the day, you got to work on stuff you love, you got to be having fun, and I think people want to be having impact.

(00:38:29):
I think there's one myth that can get in people's ways. The idea that the more people you manage or the larger your scope is, the more impact you have. I definitely do not think that is true. I mean, look at Community Notes for example. If I had stayed running a large consumer PM team, what would I have produced? 16 more pages of OKRs? I don't know, a bunch of documents? I think building Community Notes has had way bigger impact on the world. It's become the industry standard for how to deal with this now, which is super cool. People love it, it's the first thing that is plausibly dealing with the internet-scale issue of information quality. I think it's unquestionably a bigger impact than I would've had if I were just doing whatever, doing some standard management track thing like I was doing before. I think that's true of so many other small companies and startups. Someone screenshotted I think it's Blake Scholl's LinkedIn the other day. He went from director of coupons or something to building the first supersonic-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
Yeah, from Groupon.

Keith Coleman (00:39:41):
Those stories are everywhere when you look, so I definitely have found that, for me, I love building hands-on, I love trying crazy new ideas. I love the zero-to-one experience. It's fun to scale things up too, and it can be fun to operate at scale, but this team is a good example of one that operates at a very large scale, but that is still very small.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):
Yeah, I think the way you guys operate is what more and more companies are trying to do, remove middle management layers, create small teams that just execute and build impact, just like Ics. Whenever I say IC, I have a comment on YouTube, where like, "What is IC?" I'm just going to explain, individual contributor, non-manager is when I say the word IC. Let me follow this thread, and when I asked people about how you set up the team to operate effectively and protect it initially, there's this term, "Thermal," that came up a lot. It was like a thermal team, if that's how you describe it.

Keith Coleman (00:40:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:38):
What is thermal?

Keith Coleman (00:40:39):
Yeah, so anyone who's worked in a larger company probably knows that things can get bureaucratic or bogged-down, decision-making can be slow. There's these large planning cycles, people can try to take someone from one team, move them to another at random arbitrary times that can disrupt a project, all sorts of things like that. Our company, this is a number of years ago when we started this project, we had a lot of founders in the company. Kayvon is an example of founder who is helping to run the company, and he had this idea, "Hey, why don't we create this program, call it Thermal, where we could have teams that were somewhat isolated from that." They could run through their own process, they would have one clear owner. The team would be entirely dedicated to that project and we would just repeatedly make funding decisions as to whether to continue the effort.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:31):
Why was it called Thermal, by the way? What was the idea there?

Keith Coleman (00:41:35):
I think it was an old bird analogy of thermals lifting the bird on their wings. Twitter 1.0 obviously had a lot of bird analogies, bless its heart, so that was one of them. I loved the idea, as someone who liked the startup environment, so when we were starting this project, I was like, "Hey, Kayvon. Why don't we make this the first Thermal project?" And he was like, "Yeah, let's do it," so we started with that way of operating and it gave us, from day one, a lot of freedom and autonomy that I think was really important to make the product work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):
Just be very specific about it. What makes it a Thermal project? How do you set that up? This is asking from perspective, if a company wants to build their own something like this, what does that look like?

Keith Coleman (00:42:24):
Yeah, I think there's a bunch of key attributes. One key attribute is there's one clear driver of the project, who's effectively a founder. I guess maybe you could have two or something, but really clear, there's driver of the project and also there's one clear decision-maker that they go to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:43):
Outside of the team?

Keith Coleman (00:42:44):
Outside of the team. That was true back when we started and it is true now. If we need something or have a question about something, I talk to Elon. It was like that from the beginning, it's like that now, and I think that's a big reason we're able to make decisions effectively, quickly, in a simple way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:02):
It probably has to be someone very senior, not [inaudible 00:43:05] manager.

Keith Coleman (00:43:06):
Someone senior who can make the decisions you need made, whatever they are. I think that's really important, that clear decision-making structure. Another was 100% focus, so everyone on the project is expected to be totally focused on it. A lot of companies, it can be easy to have people's attention spread across a bunch of things, and it makes it hard to get stuff done. You'll talk to whoever that person is, you'll ask them for help on something, and they'll be like, "Yeah, I'll help you. I got to finish this thing, and it'll take me a week or two and then I'll get to it." A week or two delay totally changes the momentum of a project. When we were 100% focused, we talk in the morning, it's like, "Hey, Jay. Why don't we try this thing in the algorithm?" He's like, "Yeah." Then that afternoon or the next day, we're looking at results.

(00:43:59):
Because of that total focus, the rate of iteration goes way up. Then beyond that, there was also just the ability to use whatever our own decision-making process was. We didn't need to write OKRs or... For others standard practices. Obviously, we had to make sure we were responsibly building the product and everything, but we didn't need to use the standard practices. I think that's another great example, OKRs, I understand why they can be helpful, but they can also be not necessarily the right cadence at which to set goals. I think it's really unclear that quarterly or annual goals are actually the right pace. We would set the goal for the next milestone that mattered, and we would work on that. We reached that milestone, we would have an idea of what was coming after, and then when we hit that, we'd set the next milestone. Whether that was two weeks, a month, three months, whatever it was. We set our own pace and goals at that pace, and that just I think is a lot more natural for the development of something.

Jay Baxter (00:45:06):
The whole OKR determination and planning process took longer than it would take us to pick a goal and then execute on it and finish it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):
How big was the team early on that you set up? How many engineers?

Keith Coleman (00:45:19):
It started with just me and then, when we decided to build the thing, we figured we needed about five. We wanted it to be as small as we possibly could. It was clear we needed someone on ML doing scoring, it was clear we needed someone to do some client engineering work, someone to do backend engineering work. There may have been one or two other. We needed a designer and a researcher to help us understand the customer base and make sure we were building the thing in a way that was actually going to resonate with people. I think it was backend, frontend, ML, design research. That was the original team, from what I remember.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:01):
Amazing. Basically, one of each function. A question I have for Jay, actually, is there's all this talk of small teams and moving fast, but sometimes you just need more engineers to build the thing. Is there anything you've learned about just how to keep a team small while moving as fast as you are, and not need or need to hire more engineers?

Jay Baxter (00:46:22):
I think, in the beginning when we were iterating on what should even the requirements be, it was definitely good to just have one ML engineer, but I think, at some point, we got clear on what the goals of the algorithm should really be and we tried... I think, at the very beginning, it wasn't clear that we needed to build this bridging-based algorithm. The actual first algorithm that I put into production was very focused on anti-manipulation. It was this page rank variant, but it didn't solve the problem of bias, basically. If there are more users on one side, a page rank type graph algorithm can actually amplify those biases. I think, after building that prototype and getting data from that, it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was going to be the way that we needed to solve it, and at that point, basically I set up a bake-off. Kind of a Kaggle competition or something. That was the key time where it was really important to pull in other engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
That is such a cool story. I want to follow that thread. Before we do that, you just mentioned you guys yell "Thermal." What does that mean? Is that YOLO, like a version of... Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:47:43):
We're just going to ship, because we're thermal project.

Jay Baxter (00:47:46):
Ship it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):
Okay. Marketers, I know that you love [inaudible 00:47:52], so let me get right to the point. Wix Studio gives you everything you need to cater to any client at any scale, all in one place. Here's how your workflow could look. Scale content with dynamic pages and reusable assets effortlessly, fast-track projects with built-in marketing integrations like Meta, CAPI, Zapier, Google Ads, and more. A-B test landing pages in days, not weeks, with intuitive design tools, connected tracking, and analytics tools, like Google Analytics and Semrush. Encapture key business events without the hassle of manual setup, manage all your client's social media and communications from a unified dashboard, then create, schedule, and post content across all their channels. If you're working on content-rich sites, Wix Studio's No-Code CMS lets you build and manage without touching the design. When you're ready for more, Wix Studio grows with you. Add your own code, create custom integrations with Wix-made APIs, or leverage robust native business solutions. Drive real client growth with Wix Studio. Go to Wixstudio.com.

(00:48:52):
Okay, so coming back to this algorithm, this is actually really interesting, because I've never heard any of this. I was going to ask just what inspired this actual algorithm, and you basically did an internal competition amongst ML engineers to see who had the most successful algorithm. Netflix-contest style, Kaggle style.

Jay Baxter (00:49:09):
Yeah, yeah. This particular idea of finding content that is liked by people on opposite sides of a polarized divider who typically disagree, this was not an idea out of thin air. I think Keith had found some of Chris Bale's work, he had made this list of accounts that were often liked by people who were on both sides politically. There is other projects, like polls out there that look for agreement among people who typically disagree, but I think that it wasn't obvious that our project definitely needed to use that from the very beginning. When you implement it and compare it against these other type... PageRank seems, obviously, it's designed to be manipulation-resistant. Naturally, if you just have a voting ring of people who all vote themselves up, then PageRank can filter that out very well, but that just wasn't the main attack vector, I guess.

(00:50:15):
We had to get some real data from the pilot to realize that, "Okay, the real thing going on here is people are polarized," so it was only once we got that, the real data from the pilot, that I think it was clear that the bridging-based algorithm was the direction we really needed to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:34):
I want to come back to the way you operate the team. I hear that you run the whole team off a single Google Doc that's like a four-year-old doc that you just keep adding goals to, bullet points. Is that true?

Keith Coleman (00:50:47):
There is a very long-running doc that has had to be chopped and purged, because it was breaking Google Docs in Chrome at various points in time. It's like a note-taking doc. It's really where we coordinate what we're doing. The team meets on a daily basis, we spend whatever amount of time we need to get on the same page about what we're building. We might talk about anything from what's most important right now to, "What should we work on next?" To, "What are we trying to launch right now, and why is it not launched? What's in the way of launching it?" We might review new modeling or scoring algorithm update and try to understand what's working in it, what's not. We'll just cover whatever we want or whatever feels most important. As you said, we set our goals very dynamically, so whatever seems like the most important thing for us to work on now and next is what we spend our time on. I think that's served the project really well versus feeling attached to some quarterly goals, or something. We'll look at, "What is going to help people the most?" Or, "What's the biggest problem right now?" What are either one of those? And we will go tackle it. We might change our roadmap multiple times in two weeks based on what we see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:08):
I'm hearing no Jira, no Asana, no Monday.com.

Keith Coleman (00:52:11):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:12):
Okay.

Keith Coleman (00:52:12):
Yeah, I mean, we have to use Jira to coordinate with some other teams. Sometimes when we file a request, we have to make a Jira ticket. But no, I am not a fan of heavyweight task management. I love being on the same page, being able to keep most things in my head, and having a really light way to write down the things that the team can't keep in its head.

Jay Baxter (00:52:34):
We did use Asana briefly, but my memory of it is that you spent more time in the meeting grooming a backlog of irrelevant stuff than actually talking about the proper priorities. I think it's nice in the Google Doc that, if something becomes irrelevant, it can just fall off without needing explicit backlog grooming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:58):
Just to maybe summarize a little bit of how you guys operate that might inspire other companies to set teams up like this, so I'm going to go through a few things you shared. One is one person in charge of the team, like the founder almost. They're basically the founder of the team. They have one very senior, essentially, sponsor/decision-maker that they interface with. In your case, Elon, no big deal. In other cases, it could be the CTO, CPO, someone like that. The team is focused 100% on its product and goal. You keep the team very small, so you start with one person of each function. One front-end engineer, back-end, ML person, designer, researcher, PM, and then Google Docs is almost basically for your project management. Yeah, it's basically run with Google Docs, stop, don't use big, complicated products.

Keith Coleman (00:53:50):
I think that's a pretty good recipe. On the Google Docs, people can do what they want. If they want to use thumbnails, go for it. I think those first ingredients, really, are key structurally. Then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets-

Keith Coleman (00:54:00):
And then beyond that, it's a matter of having an ambitious goal that gets people fired up to go do great work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):
Yeah. Awesome. I think there's a lot there that a lot of people think they should do when they set these teams up, but they don't actually do, and it feels like each of these is just a really key ingredient to it to actually succeeding.

Keith Coleman (00:54:17):
It definitely really helped us succeed. I don't know that the project would be here if it was not for some of those elements.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:24):
That's a powerful statement. This thing that has changed the way the world understands what is true would not have existed if you didn't set it up in this specific way.

Keith Coleman (00:54:34):
Yeah. I don't know if I would've begun the project had I not known. We had that structure, that ability to make decisions, the autonomy, the speed, the ability to go fast. We started with that in 1.0 and it's been continued and if anything, furthered in X. X as a whole company operates with a lot of those attributes, and I think it's one of the reasons the product is successful. I think those are big reasons why at least, Jay can speak for himself, I have so much fun working on this. I love working on it. It's great to wake up every day and solve these problems. We get to do them efficiently, make decisions quickly, build stuff that helps a lot of people. It's awesome.

Jay Baxter (00:55:25):
This whether thermal or Elon way of operating is definitely more fun and the fact that... That combined with the awesome mission is super important for internal recruiting. I remember when I was first chatting to Keith about this back in early 2020, I had another project. I worked on a few, but one was like personalize the number of push notifications that we send, and it drove a lot of DAU without losing opt-outs significantly. So that was setting me on track, or if I had kept working on that, I could have probably gotten a promotion from that with low risk, or I could take this huge career... It's not as big at a career risk as joining or founding an actual external startup, but there is still career risk, I guess, in joining a team like this. I think all of the same aspects of recruiting that apply to external startups and apply internally, and if you can have an exciting vision, that is key.

Keith Coleman (00:56:30):
Related to that and your list, Lenny, one thing we missed that's super important is that on this project, and I think of successful projects like it in startups, is that people are self-selecting to join. We did not assign anyone to this project. People reached out to join or they applied to join the job. I and the team interviewed every single person that joined the team and we were like, "We want that person on the team. They want to be on the team." And so people are totally bought in to the goal, mission, the way the team works, the other people they're going to be working with. And that makes a huge difference.

(00:57:10):
So a great time to do that is at the start of one of these things. If you're going to try something crazy, it's going to be tough if you're just assigning random people to it. But if you let people opt in and self-select much more likely to be successful. And one thing that I have observed at X, which really surprised me was that this is also possible at a large scale. One of the things that Elon did when he bought the company was he basically asked people to self-select to stay. You had to click the button. And he sent an email out that was like, "Hey, Twitter 2.0."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):
Fork in the road. Right? [inaudible 00:57:46]

Keith Coleman (00:57:45):
Fork in the road. Fork in the road. Exactly. He's like, "Twitter 2.0, now X, it's going to be hardcore. We're going to do ambitious things. You're going to work your butt off." And you had to click on the form and say, "Yes, I want to join." And I think that was really important for the company because you want people to opt into that. You want the people to be saying, "Yeah, that's what I want to do," and the company's going to be a lot more successful. If people aren't sure, it's better for them probably to go do something else and where they're naturally more aligned and happier. And I thought that was a great approach to taking a large company and getting it down to people who are really excited about working together on a mission. So for us, we did it from day one, which I think is an easy way to do it, but it's possible to do it later as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):
I love that you described it as fun and I think a lot of people when they see Elon laying off a bunch of people, being very hardcore himself, people don't imagine it as a fun place to work. And it's clear how much you guys love working on this, how fun it is and how interesting it is. And it's interesting to hear that 'cause I think a lot of people don't feel that externally. Is there anything else along the lines of just working for Elon within an org Elon runs that might surprise people about just the way of working that's interesting or surprising or you think other companies might want to think about adopting?

Keith Coleman (00:59:07):
I've always liked lean teams, but my experience at X has made me change the way I would think about running a future org-... If I were to start a company and had to change the way I think about starting that company, I would be even leaner than I would've made it before. I've been amazed with just how much the team is able to accomplish with a small group. And I think because of a small group, shortly after the acquisition, we had this product called Spaces. It had been in the product before, but it was pretty small scale, and Elon wanted to run these large spaces. I forget who the first people he was going to bring on were, but he was going to be there. Ultimately, these things have gone on to host politicians and things like that, and he's like, "Guys, we got to scale this up." I forget the numbers.

(00:59:57):
He's like, "We need to be able to scale a million people," or something like that. I'm getting the numbers wrong. "You need to be able to scale way up." This is the kind of thing at 1.0 That would've taken a year if it had ever happened, and the team did it in two or three weeks. And it was really exciting and inspiring to see. I didn't work on that, but I watched it from the outside. I'm like, "Wow, with this tiny team motivated behind a big goal that was like, 'Hey, guys, it's not like, are we going to do this?' It's, 'We are going to do this.'" They got it done in two or three weeks. That must've felt amazing for them. It was certainly exciting to see. But I've definitely come to appreciate just how lean something can be and not just get by but actually thrive because it's that lean.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):
I think the point you made about people opting into that is important, 'cause I think a lot of people hearing that would be like, "I would never want to be asked to build something like that in two weeks." And I think a lot of people do, and we love that kind of experience, especially working with the Elon, especially shipping something at that scale. But I think there's an important element there of just like, "Okay, I don't want to do that. I have other things to do in my life other than ship spaces." So I think that's a key point you've raised of just there's an opt-in step.

Keith Coleman (01:01:10):
Totally. I think the opt in is important, and it may even be that you want to opt in at one point in your life, and maybe at another point in your life something else is better. I think whatever it is you're choosing to do, it's nice to be opting in to feel like it's aligned with how you want to spend your time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):
Something on my mind, and I don't know if you guys want to go here, but it's something I think a lot of people think about is when Elon came in, he let go of 80% of folks. And everyone's just like, "Twitter is dead. It's all going to fall apart. There's no way they can run this thing with that small of a staff," and clearly they were wrong. Clearly, it's working great. It's becoming a massive deal in the world and continues to grow. Is there anything about that that you were surprised by or anything about just how it continues to operate so well in spite of that big shift?

Keith Coleman (01:01:57):
I think the leaner team, the reduced process in bureaucracy is a big reason it does move as fast as it does. It's easier to get stuff done faster here. Yeah. I think that shrinking is actually a big reason for the increased pace of launches, the increased pace of experimentation. One thing that I noticed a result of that is the people who are here, they seem to all really feel like owners. They take the sense of responsibility that an owner takes in the product. They'll try to track down what's wrong, fix whatever is needed, jump in to help build or fix, improve any system that needs help, even if it's outside of their space. And there's the flip side of that too. For people who've worked at big companies, they may have experienced this thing where there's like ano-... You want to change something in some other system or product, and so you reach out to that team. And maybe they're a little resistant, they'll maybe be like, "Oh, we'll get to that next quarter or so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:07):
They have their own goals to hit. Yeah. [inaudible 01:03:08]

Keith Coleman (01:03:08):
Yeah. Exactly. They don't really necessarily want to help you or they're busy. Here, you're like, "Hey, guys, we need to do this thing with that other system you work on." And they're like, "Great! Here's the code. Here are the docs. Send us the fab if you have any questions, and we'll get it in." And it's just the thing, you can just jump in and get it done. And that kind of collaborative effort, like the sense of shared ownership, I think from my experience came from or was a result of the shrinking of the team down to people who wanted to be there and work together to build this thing. So I think that's been a really positive impact. It's not always easy. Certainly, a lot of people have a lot of responsibilities, but they're here because they're up for it.

Jay Baxter (01:03:53):
Yeah. I think one other thing that's key is when you are forced to have such a small team, well, this is important anyways, but deleting code is more important than writing it a lot of the time. So I think so often maybe due to promotion incentives or just regular human tendency, engineers have a tendency to add these little incremental wins that actually add more of a long-term maintenance cost than is clear, because you just run a little one month A-B test, you see this significant win and you don't realize the maintenance burden you just added to your team for the rest of eternity until you turn the thing off. So I think there's a lot to be gained and you get forced to do this, by the way, when you have such a small team. It's just auditing parts of your system and deleting the things where the maintenance cost is worse than the gains. So I think we did have to do this across the company after the big layoffs, and systems are leaner now and they can be worked on by fewer numbers of people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):
That's an amazing point. I remember Elon's being like, "Here, we have to throw away the whole thing. We have to re-architect everything. It's stupid the way it's built." And it sounds like that actually worked.

Jay Baxter (01:05:10):
Yeah, so-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:10):
Well.

Jay Baxter (01:05:11):
You don't have to rewrite everything from scratch. Some things are good, I guess, to rewrite. But just even deleting the unnecessary cruft and keeping the rest of the core system, that's awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:23):
I love that we're creating a formula to run these sorts of companies and teams. There's so much here. I want to go back to the building of the original product. I took us on a long tangent and an amazing tangent, but I heard a story of when you launched Birdwatch at that point. You specifically wanted to keep expectations very low and there was a GIF in the thing, and it just looked like clearly this is not ready for prime time. Talk about just how you did that, how you launched it in a way where people weren't like, "It's never going to work."

Keith Coleman (01:05:53):
We were very disciplined, I guess you could say, about having the product prove itself at every given point. When we built the first mockups, these were just pictures of depicting what community notes might look like. We showed those to people across the political spectrum. We saw, hey, people really like these. Whether they're on the right or left, they seem very open to reading these community notes even when they're critical to people of their own side. So we're like, "All right. That gives us confidence that if we can build this, if we can actually make this as a reality, it's going to work." Then there's a question of can we make it a reality? Will people in the real world be able to write notes that are of this quality?

(01:06:35):
And so we had an internal pilot test version of this where you could write notes. And we first basically ran this through an Amazon MTurk type of participant test just to see if you just put some normal people in there, will they be able to write these notes? All those notes weren't good, but it was clear that there were people out there who could write good notes. So then like, "Okay, this is possible. What will happen if we actually do this out in the real world? And let's run a pilot and find out." And so we took that pilot that we'd run the MTurk of test on, and we released it to at first 1000 people, totally out in public, and we didn't know what was going to show up. You could imagine the notes could have been terrible.

(01:07:27):
And so we were talking, "Well, what do we do? We're going to put this out there. Everyone's going to have all these questions. They're probably going to be really skeptical, and we know it might be a total dumpster fire. And so what do we do to set expectations appropriately?" We felt like we could probably get there in the end, but we just didn't know what was going to happen at first. We wanted to set expectations, and so we're like, "Well, why don't we just stick..." There's the page where you see a post in the notes below. We're like, "Why don't we just stick a dumpster fire GIF on that page?" And you go there, you're like, "Hey, anything you see below here might just be a total dumpster fire. At least it would show we were aware of that as a possible risk." In the end, we did not do that. It cracked me up, but we thought it was like-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):
Oh, you didn't actually launch. Okay. That was just a concept. Okay.

Keith Coleman (01:08:16):
We had mockups of it, and every time I looked at the mockup, I laughed, but ultimately we had so much to explain on that page, like, what is this thing and how does it work? Ultimately, we're like, "Okay, this is probably going to distract from the point." So we pulled it. I wish maybe it had seen the light of day at one point, but yeah, ultimately we kept it simple and we focused that page on explaining what was going on here. But again, as has happened many times with the project, we put the pilot out there and the notes were good.

(01:08:48):
They weren't all good. It was a mixed bag, but there was gold in there. And from the very early days with just 1000 contributors, it was obvious that people could write notes that were informative, that were neutral, that spoke to controversial challenging topics, and that if we could just identify those from the rest, this was going to work. It was going to work as well as the very first mockups we had made. So that became the focus that is, how do we sift out the gold from the rest?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
I think you may have shared with this with me, when someone noticed you guys were testing this and they took screenshots and tweeted it, and I think Elon replied, "This is cool."

Keith Coleman (01:09:27):
Yeah. Yeah. So in the very early days when it was just a Figma prototype, we were running these usertesting.com on moderated studies. I guess one of the participants sent one to an NBC reporter who wrote a bunch of stories on it. Anyway, that day, there was a lot of chatter about it on the service, and Elon... To put this back in time perspective, this is, I think, 2020, so two years before any acquisition stuff happened, Elon is just a Twitter user building rockets and electric cars and other cool stuff and stumbles on this thing that depicts the prototype that we've been testing. And he writes back, "Definitely worth trying, IMO." And I remember thinking that was cool back then and it's interesting to see, he's obviously had a very consistent point on it. I think the idea was appealing and he has obviously been a big fan of it in the product and had been a big supporter proponent. So yeah, it was cool that it came from... that support has been from the very early days before he was ever involved in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
I love that moment. That must have felt really wild for Elon to be commenting on this Figma prototype retesting.

Keith Coleman (01:10:42):
It was cool. It was cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:44):
Oh, man. So when we were preparing for this interview, I asked you guys what's the main thing you want to make sure people get and understand about why community notes has been so effective? And Keith, you specifically said that it was the principles behind how you wanted to approach this and how you continue to stick to this throughout. And we'll talk about how you kept it alive throughout all these different CO changes in leaders. But just talk about these principles, what the actual principles are and why that was so key to it working out.

Keith Coleman (01:11:16):
There are a number of principles that I think when we first shared them with people at the company seemed maybe a little bit crazy. But I think they are the reason the product works, and I think they've been very important, and we do. We come back to them regularly, today, all the time. Probably the craziest one is just that this thing is going to be the voice of the people. It's going to represent the voice of people. It's not going to represent the company's voice. So it is not a tech company deciding what shows. It is the people deciding what shows, and that had a lot of implications on the design. First of all, we don't have a button that will change the status of a note. So if a note is showing because the people have rated it and found it helpful, it is going to show. We can't change that.

(01:12:08):
And that is the kind of thing that when we first propose this, that's unsettling to people. They're like, "Wait, so something can go up and the company can't take it down, or can't change its status, get it to stop showing." And we're like, "Yeah, and it has to work that well. If it doesn't work well enough to do that, then it doesn't work." This is one of our key principles was, if there's a problem with a note that's so bad, you want to do something about it's a problem with the system. We need to redesign the system to be showing good notes. And so yeah, we had to get everyone comfortable with the idea that there was no button to change the status of a note. Similarly, as we talked about earlier, we wanted this to represent all of humanity.

(01:12:53):
And so we didn't want to be arbiters of who can come in and be a contributor and who can't. So we open it to everyone. You just have to meet a really basic objective criteria. You have to have a verified phone to help reduce the likelihood of having bots or things like that participating. But beyond that, it's random selection and it still is that way today. And again, that people took some time to get people comfortable with it. But I think that the fact that this is the voice of the people and reflects their output through an open and transparent process is so key to both why it is good, why it works, but also why it's trusted. So that's number one and I think will forever be the heart of the product. Another one that people thought was crazy was transparency.

(01:13:49):
The previous approaches to dealing with misleading info, it felt to a lot of people, like black box tech companies or media companies or leads or whatever making decisions. We're like, "People need to get comfortable with this. They need to trust this. So the whole thing has to be out in the open." The code that decides what notes share has to be out in the open. All of the data and ratings that make it happen have to be out in the open. People should be able to take the code and data and replicate the whole service and that we have done exactly what we've said we've done. And they should be able to audit it. They should be able to go and look and say, "Hey, I think this part could be better."

(01:14:28):
Or if they think we're biased, they should be able to work with the data and point it out. And if people have good observations, that should factor back into the code. And this is, again, something that's difficult to get people comfortable with, that everything is out there, you can't cover anything up. But I think that's so essential to people trusting it. Yeah, we set these out on day one. We go back to them constantly because we're always evolving the product, and we're always like got to make sure every new change is open. Whenever we update the scoring system, there's an update in GitHub when the data is published daily so you can download it. And so yeah, I think those have been really essential to the thing working.

Jay Baxter (01:15:13):
And by the way, these do not come without a cost. It's actually really hard from an end perspective to actually open source the actual algorithm that's running on the actual data. Because the way large-scale services like this are usually architected does not naturally lend itself to being run as a script by someone who's downloaded a TSV. So we actually have to take weird architectural decisions to make this possible in a way that probably wouldn't have been if we didn't start with this assumption from scratch. We would've had to maybe rewrite the system to make it like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:49):
What's an example of that?

Jay Baxter (01:15:50):
For instance, there's a matrix factorization that we train. Usually, you would train a matrix factor... train your ML model once and then serve it, I guess with a separate service. But we didn't want to have people externally spinning up services to be able to replicate the system that we had. So basically, I don't think it would've been actually very cool if we had open sourced the code in a way that wasn't actually runnable, I guess, by someone just... At this point, you can download Python code and run a script. You do need a lot of RAM right now, but you can do it on one machine.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
Okay. How much RAM are we talking about?

Jay Baxter (01:16:37):
Oh, only like 500 gigs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):
Okay. Okay. That's reasonable.

Jay Baxter (01:16:41):
It'll take a day if you don't do anything special to speed it up. Good to know, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:45):
Cool.

Jay Baxter (01:16:46):
Possible is the key thing, and people have done it. Vitalik Buterin had a blog post where he talks about his explorations, making sure the algorithm really does what it says it does. And I think just the fact that a handful of people have done this, there's enough people who have done it that there's someone you'd probably trust who's verified it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
And that's rolling out to Meta. No big deal. I love just as you described these principles, just I could imagine a PM at a company being like, "Okay, guys. Here, I want to do this project." There's so much idealism to it that rarely works in real life; going to be open source. You're going to give it to everyone. We don't have actual control over what it's going to do, don't worry about it. It's going to just change the way people see this thing that we've been very careful about and then it works. And I think that's very rare and it's really impressive. And what I'm hearing partly is that sticking to those principles was actually really fundamental to it working and not bending over when someone's like, "No, no, no, we can't do this. What if we change this part?"

Keith Coleman (01:17:54):
I think if we had broken with any of those principles, if there was anything black box, if there was whatever, the product would be a lot harder to trust. And so I think it's because we've just stuck to them so cleanly simply that people can trust it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:11):
You've talked about a few moments when it was like, wow, the White House changed their announcement because of the community note. We talked about the dog is a cat. Are there any other moments that after you launched of, "Holy shit, this is working? This is going to actually work."

Keith Coleman (01:18:26):
All along, we saw it working. We wanted to be confident whenever we expanded it to new audiences or new countries or whatever, we wanted to be confident it was going to work. So maybe held our breath a little bit just to see that it would do what we expected, but we always expected that. But that said, there were definitely stress cases. The one that comes to mind is the start of the Israel Hamas conflict in 2023 in October. That was probably the largest deluge of misleading information I've ever seen shared on the internet at one time. It was overwhelming. A number of photos and videos and whatever coming out related to that, it was insane. And just to give you an example, I think it was first three days or something of that conflict, we had 500 notes covering all sorts of different... out of context imagery.

(01:19:32):
Someone would say, "Hey, this is happening here." It's actually from 2013 in Syria. There were people making fake battle footage in the video game simulator Arma 3. So there were notes explaining, this stuff looked realistic. And unless you saw the note, you wouldn't really know. There are all sorts of claims about what was going on in the ground, and that was definitely... The product was still pretty new at that point. We'd expanded in the U. S. less than a year before that. We had been rolling out throughout the world that year and then this large event happened. And I felt like we were just enough prepared at the right time for the system to be able to handle that.

(01:20:16):
Probably one of the most important things we did right before that was launch the ability to write notes on images and videos and have those matched to other posts. I remember at that time thinking, "Wow, I'm glad we launched that feature a few months ago versus still had it on the shelf," because it was really important in that conflict. And I think even it was just a few weeks before we had launched a major speed up in notes too. When we first built the product, the number one focus was always quality. We knew that the product would live and die by the quality of the notes. That was the thing we could never give up on. We also knew it needed to deliver speed and scale, but we're like, "We will get the quality in the right place, and we can speed it up and scale-

Keith Coleman (01:21:00):
Get the quality in the right place and we can speed it up and scale it out over time. And we had actually just launched a speed-up that took three hours off the time it needed to go live, and it was I think a matter of weeks before that conflict happened, so again, super glad that was out there. In the first few days of the conflict the median time from a post going live to a note showing up was five hours, which is like crazy fast. Typical fact checking is like two to four, at least it's really common to see it take two to four days. These notes were showing up in five hours and we're like, we are so glad we got those things out before this happened, it made the service a lot more helpful.

Jay Baxter (01:21:40):
One other thing that was, I think, nice to see working then was, one criticism of Community Notes some people bring up is, well if you always need agreement from people who typically disagree, then in these super polarized settings, that conflict being probably number one, then you wouldn't see any notes. But actually the reality was there were tons of notes about that conflict. So I think there was this kind of nice property where actually, and maybe this is a surprising fact, that there's more agreement out there across polarized divides than maybe conventional wisdom says, and the places where people agreed were really objectively true and verifiable. I guess maybe this is more true the more polarized the setting is, but where the agreement actually lends you, and basically notes that are very neutrally written, very focused on the facts and easy to verify information.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
There's this talk for a while of just there's no more facts, nobody believes there is a single true fact anymore, everything is subjective, and I think Community Notes proves the opposite. Facts matter, there are facts that we can all agree with even on the most controversial topics.

Keith Coleman (01:23:04):
Yeah, we saw this really from day one, when we would show those prototypes to people just depicting the idea, it was really obvious that people cared more about, or they cared a lot about understanding reality and what was going on and they were willing to disagree with their side, so to speak, to recognize that. And I think that's not always that obvious to people. The world does feel really polarized, but people definitely are willing to cross partisan boundaries to get to accurate information and that's why the product works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
It feels like as we rely more and more on what we know and understand about the world is becoming social media online and moving this quickly, it's like I'm so thankful this exists because otherwise it'd just be, what do we trust anymore? This being out aligns with we need this thing to exist at the same time. And it feels like at the same time there's also people I just don't trust. I think people have shifted from I trust what I read to, okay, I shouldn't just believe everything I'm reading. Is there anything there you're noticing about just how people think about news they see and their shift of just like, I'm not going to believe everything. Is there anything that you've noticed about just human behavior or just the way we've shifted understanding what is true?

Keith Coleman (01:24:30):
We haven't done any research to look broadly at how people's perceptions are changing there, but I certainly have found myself that particularly seeing notes, I am more skeptical about what I read at first, and I think that's been helpful. And we hear that from people, that they think about things a bit more, and I think that's a good secondary effect and benefit of something like this, which is the more you see the patterns of how what you're reading can be wrong, the more you can thoughtfully question it and try to get a better understanding of what's really going on. So historically I think this was called media literacy, but basic idea of can you understand the ways in which things can go wrong and try to cut them yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:25:21):
Another aspect I think we help with that is discovery of the Community Notes. I think often before Community Notes you could have just been living in a little news filter bubble, or maybe there were fact checks out there that you should have been reading but you weren't discovering them. So the fact that the note applies, it is directly attached to the post and visible by anyone who sees the post helps cross those filter bubbles and can kind of... I think for some people it's the first time they've actually seen counter arguments to claims made in their own little echo chamber.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):
That's incredible, yeah. I love the point you're making about how it actually teaches people to be a little more skeptical of the things they read. It's an education system more than just, here, this one thing is wrong. I love that.

(01:26:13):
Okay, just a few more questions. There was an audience question asked on Twitter, we all asked on Twitter, "What do people want to know about Community Notes?" one was actually why you guys switched to anonymous contributors, what was the decision behind that?

Keith Coleman (01:26:26):
Yeah, we had this pilot where we were testing with a small number of contributors, a few thousand contributors, and we learned a lot through that pilot. Probably the biggest thing we learned was related to anonymity or pseudonymity of contributors. We had originally assumed that it was important that people contribute under their real handle, or their real name, or whatever it was. The first prototypes depicted that, we kind of thought that would be important for people trusting the note, and actually it was totally wrong. The best option was actually opposite of what we first tried.

(01:27:02):
We found a few things. One, people were hesitant to write a note on a controversial topic because they didn't want to get attacked or harassed online. And so some people were comfortable doing this but others were not, and so it meant there was more potential good notes to be written than were getting written, and this was very clear feedback from the pilot.

(01:27:24):
Two, and this is super interesting, people are actually more willing to cross partisan boundaries when they are anonymous or pseudonymous than when they are under their real name, and it intuitively makes a lot of sense. If you publicly are using your name, you feel are affiliated with one side versus the other, you might hesitate to be perceived as breaking with that side. But you may actually, for example, find a note helpful that's critical of that side, and there's a bunch of studies that show when people are anonymous, they're much more willing to cross partisan boundaries and work with the other side, agree with the other side, and we saw that too. And so by allowing people to be pseudonymous, you actually get more honest answers about what they really think and it helps find disagreement that really-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:11):
That's so counterintuitive.

Keith Coleman (01:28:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:12):
You never hear the opposite always, and it's so interesting it's the opposite.

Keith Coleman (01:28:15):
Yeah, yeah.

Jay Baxter (01:28:17):
I think the same principle applies to making the likes private.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):
I was just thinking that.

Jay Baxter (01:28:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:23):
Yeah, I like a lot more stuff that's a little, definitely, I wouldn't have liked, yeah.

Keith Coleman (01:28:28):
It allows freedom for honesty, which is pretty great. And one of the criticisms of pseudonymity is it can generate, maybe people have reached the quality threshold that they put out there, but we have so many quality mechanisms in the system that that wasn't an issue, so we could keep quality high while opening up for that honesty.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):
Another question, you touched on this a little bit, which is around navigating the existing trust and safety apparatus of Twitter, which as you described, basically, previously, it was like we make decisions on what is true and not, and every company works this way, you guys basically upended that like, here's a completely different way, you have no control over what we say is true or not. Talk about just that experience of overcoming that, I imagine, very difficult hurdle of like, okay, forget all that, we're going to do it totally different.

Keith Coleman (01:29:20):
Yeah, it was definitely, what we were proposing was very different. I will say that I think people were sort of open-minded to it, generally speaking, and I think everyone had a sense that what was being done at the time wasn't really working that well or solving the problem, and people were open to new ideas, so that's a good foundation.

(01:29:39):
But I think one thing we did that was probably very helpful in that is we wanted the product to prove itself at any point. First it had to prove that people could possibly find notes helpful, then it had to prove that people could possibly write these notes that would be good quality. And so anytime that we were proposing doing something with the product, like running some research test, or running the pilot, or expanding the pilot, we always had the data that had convinced us that that was a good decision, like we were stepping into the next phase of expansion that made sense. And so I think we probably rarely proposed anything that seemed unwise, because we were holding such a high bar for quality ourselves, and I suspect that went a long way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:33):
So it's partly, what I'm hearing is, take it step by step to prove this is actually working, and partly be confident it is working to yourself before you try to convince the trust and safety team this is the way to go.

Keith Coleman (01:30:46):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:49):
Was there a moment along that journey it shifted from no way this is a thing to okay, wow, let's actually consider this? Or was it this very gradual process?

Keith Coleman (01:30:59):
Whether other people were saying no way to wow, let's actually-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Yeah, just internally of just like, okay, we're going to actually stop this trust and safety way of operating and instead rely on Community Notes, was there a moment of like, okay, let's actually make that switch, or was that Elon actually, is that the big switch?

Keith Coleman (01:31:15):
The biggest change there happened in X, the biggest changes prior to that were just the decision to put this out there and have it be operating in public at first US wide scale. But yeah, then the bigger switches came in the X period.

Jay Baxter (01:31:36):
I think even though there was original research before Birdwatch had even started, or Community Notes had even started, from external researchers showing that crowdsourced fact-checkers, laypeople can do about as well as fact-checkers and actually the agreement rates were kind of similar between the groups. I think even though that research was out there, I think there were definitely a lot of people who didn't really believe it could work until it already worked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:04):
Basically prove it, prove that it works. Yeah, that makes sense, versus just a bunch of docs and strategy and thinking, it's just like, look, it's actually working, you can see for yourself.

Jay Baxter (01:32:13):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:14):
Makes sense. Okay, possibly last question, we'll see which fractals of questions you guys bring up here. I referenced this a couple times, this incredible achievement of keeping a project alive through Jack and then, I have this note, and Kayvon running the show then, and then Parag running Twitter, and then Elon, and then Linda taking over as CEO, quite rare, especially something this visible, this impactful to everything that X is. Any lessons or keys to that actually working, of this project surviving throughout so many work changes and leaders?

Keith Coleman (01:32:54):
It definitely has been a crazy time to be building something. It's been fun. The craziness has been entertaining. I think one reason perhaps the product has done so well and survived is the nature of the product itself. It is designed to produce information that is found helpful by people who normally disagree. And so even if you have CEOs or leaders who might disagree, there's a good chance actually they'll find it helpful, they'll be like, wow, this thing does produce pretty useful output. So I think there's something in the nature of the product itself, that when people see it, whatever side they're on, left, up, down, they're likely to find it pretty helpful, so I do think that helps.

(01:33:39):
I also think the team executed really well. We had ambitious goals that were exciting, they solved a real problem. This is a real problem that matters in the world. At every step, as we talked about, the product needed to prove itself, and we would make sure it proved itself and we would bring the results that convinced us and we'd share those with people. And so they would say, oh yeah, I agree, it kind of proved itself, let's take the next leap. And we've done that all along the way and we continue to operate that way, and I think that focus on the outcome and goal that matters, and executing against it, really helped.

(01:34:24):
The team did not get distracted by much all through the period during which the acquisition happened. There was a lot of opportunity for distraction. This team was shipping every week, we were super focused on the goal, let's make this thing work, let's get these notes out there, and I think people saw that execution and were excited to support it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:49):
Yeah, like it's working, why would we mess with that? And it's important, and it keeps us from having to hire tens of thousands of people to fact check.

Keith Coleman (01:34:57):
The interesting thing about that is no one ever asked us or brought up or seemed to care about anything related to cost savings in this process. And I think that's an assumption people have outside the company, that this must have been a reason there was interest in it. But that was never a goal, it was not at all why the project was started, it was not why people were excited about the project. And I think that's also, for people outside who maybe don't see the conversations, it's kind of a heartening thing to know, is that the focus was always on solving the problem. The other approach is even if you had 10,000 people doing it, the real issue is that they don't work that well because they're not trusted or they don't scale or they're too slow. And so the goal was really always just help people stay informed at scale. Let's build an internet scale solution to an internet scale problem that people like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):
Something I heard about you, Keith, when I was asking people about how this worked and why this worked so well is that they describe you with having a very low ego, and that allowed you to give up this whole team and power and influence and just the name, forget it, whatever you want, we'll call it Community Notes, great. Is there anything in there you can share of just how you think about that and how important that is as a product leader to have a low ego?

Keith Coleman (01:36:19):
For me, this project, I feel like I get to do community service with this project. I see my work as in service of the people and the community, and that's what motivates me. The only thing that I care about is delivering the outcome that the world finds helpful. And so in some ways the project has not been about ego, it's about truth-seeking, let's find... Not truth in the sense of what information is true, but let's find out what's actually going to make this work. How does it need to be structured, what should it be called? Whatever is going to produce the best outcome is what we should do. So I think I feel more attached to the product being helpful than to anything else, and so to whatever degree it might seem like low ego is probably more a result of wanting to actually solve the problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:15):
And I think partly what I'm hearing is just if you win and succeed, good things will happen, so focus on that.

Keith Coleman (01:37:20):
Certainly satisfying things will happen, it's very satisfying to have people appreciate it. It's satisfying that people on the left and right love it. It's satisfying that even people who receive notes, love notes, and reach out to them and post them, that's amazing, it feels so good to have helped give people that, and yeah, it's very motivating. It's a great reason to wake up in the morning.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:44):
It's absurd this has worked, but it's also like of course this would work, of course something like this should work. It's like such interesting-

Keith Coleman (01:37:50):
It's the internet, it's of the internet, that's why it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:55):
Oh man. Where's Community Notes going from here? What's happening, where's it going, what's the future?

Keith Coleman (01:38:03):
We're always working on basically more better notes faster. So there's clearly an opportunity to get more notes out there, we want them to stay as good or better than they are, we want to get them there faster, so we're always working on core product changes to help deliver that. Recently, for example, we just released an update to what we call the Community Notes bat signal, or the ability to request a Community Note. So anyone on X can say, "Hey, I think this post needs a Community Note," and now they can even add a source explaining why so that when a prospective writer sees that it's much easier for them to write a note. So we're always working on core things like that, core algorithm improvements.

(01:38:47):
I think there are also new frontiers that show a lot of potential, AI and LLMs are one. It's easy to imagine a lot of ways that AI could assist the people in this task they're doing of trying to get information out there quickly. And maybe Jay should talk about the Supernotes work that we've done with some folks outside the company.

Jay Baxter (01:39:13):
Yeah, so one cool thing about having public data and code is that external researchers can collaborate with you, and in this case Supernotes had this idea that we can basically take existing notes as input, existing proposed notes that maybe they have some problem, maybe they have part of the story, maybe they're worded in kind of a biased way. Basically take all these in, have an LLM generate a ton of different variants, and then basically make the simulated jury to basically get a representative group of contributors for community notes who would be rating the note and try to predict based on their past ratings how they would rate these LLM generated notes. And so this way you can actually, rather than just having an LLM write a note from scratch and hoping it's good, you can simulate the entire community notes rating process and explicitly create notes that are likely to be rated helpful by people.

(01:40:18):
So I think ideas like that are very promising for the future, and it's a nice way that LLMs and humans can work together. Obviously agents can browse the web too, and that's one way that you could imagine agents assisting humans is maybe checking whether a note is actually supported by the source. Although then you get into things like, well, are people going to actually be as diligent? Right now I think raters are very diligent because they know just some Community Notes contributor wrote this like, I better check this before I rate it helpful. But hopefully we can design things in a way such that people don't trust the output and actually verify it themselves before issuing a helpful rating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):
Yeah, that is such an interesting area to explore where you want to avoid AI hallucinating slop versus make it easier and scale it even further. What an interesting challenge.

Keith Coleman (01:41:23):
What's cool about this project, in addition to the AI element, is that it's being done outside the company. We talked earlier about the open source transparency. The key reason we made this all open source was so people could see how it worked, but the dream is actually that, it's not just that the contributions to the notes and ratings are from the people, but the dream is actually the product is built by the people. What if the scoring algorithm were significantly or entirely written by the public? That would be incredible. And Supernotes is probably the first very substantial potential change in the algorithm of the way it works, that was kind of coming from the outside and plausibly could be part of the core, so we'd love to see the product go in that direction as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:08):
Sweet, go Supernotes. Well guys, the work you're doing is tremendous. This is every product person's dream, I think to work, on something like this. Small team, lots of support, lots of impact, just innately interesting, and so I think this is going to inspire a lot of people.

(01:42:27):
So let me just ask you, is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you think might be helpful for folks to leave them with?

Jay Baxter (01:42:33):
Sure, I guess one thing that just I thought was interesting over the course of working on this product is just there's... I think in a similar way to how retweets originally were not something Jack came up with, I think users just started doing it and then it became a core part of the product. There's a huge way already in which there's just a lot of surprising things that people wanted to use Community Notes for that I don't think we really expected, and it's kind of cool to see those user desires emerge.

(01:43:04):
I think one example, I guess we had always been imagining political type of misinformation, but for whatever reason there's a lot of people who love debating whether Messi or Ronaldo got more goals. I guess it's kind of a funny one. There's a community moderation aspect, so I think we also thought that this would be specifically for adding context to misleading or potentially misleading information, but what you can see is that there are some notes that go beyond that towards calling out content that they think is spammy or something. So I think that's just another dimension in which commuted notes is a product that's driven by the people.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:57):
That's so beautiful, basically they're trying to keep Twitter/X healthy and they're just like, no, this should be taken down, this tweet of spam.

Jay Baxter (01:44:05):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):
I love that. Is there an answer on the Messi versus, who is the other soccer player?

Jay Baxter (01:44:10):
Ronaldo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:11):
Ronaldo, okay. Is there a definitive fact there or is that just unknowable?

Jay Baxter (01:44:17):
Yeah, I guess that's an interesting one because it's a case where raters are actually very polarized. I guess it actually kind of fits into the core algorithm where there's some people who are just diehard Messi fans or Ronaldo fans, just like they could be on politics, so we actually specifically modeled that topic, as well as some other topics, so we can estimate people's opinion on that particular debate. It's kind of funny that something like that would emerge.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:45):
You're saying that's the most controversial topic on X, Ronaldo versus Messi.

Jay Baxter (01:44:51):
That's a controversial one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:44:52):
Oh wow, who knew? Okay. Keith, is there anything you wanted to add?

Keith Coleman (01:44:58):
Yeah, community Notes is cool itself, but I think what it points to about society is actually even bigger. Society often feels really polarized, you hear people talk about it all the time, no one can ever agree on anything, but actually Community Note shows you people really can agree on quite a lot. Even on super controversial topics related to politics and everything, there's a lot of agreement, that's why notes work.

(01:45:23):
And I think that's a really big reason for optimism about the world, is that while it might feel polarized, there's probably like an 80% set of people that agree on quite a lot of things. And imagine if we could use the same kind of approaches we use with notes, but to find agreement on legislation, or policies, or things like that that people want the government or the world to do, possibly we could get a lot more momentum behind these ideas that the people really want and everyone would be a lot happier. Maybe 10% of the people on the edges wouldn't be happy, but I bet there's a lot of agreement that we are not identifying, and if we did it, we'd all be pretty happy. So I don't know, I think it's easy for people to feel pessimistic about the world, but I think this product is a good reason to be optimistic about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:12):
What an incredible way to end it. I can also see, Keith, why people want to join you and work with you and work on this team.

Keith Coleman (01:46:19):
Appreciate it. If you do want to join, we are hiring an ML engineer. You get to work on these amazing problems with us and have a lot of fun, so we're accepting applications at x.com/communitynotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:32):
Okay, great, I'm glad you gave the URL. Oh man, you're about to get flooded.

(01:46:36):
Guys, thank you so much for doing this. Is there anywhere other than that place to go off, join the team as an ML engineer, is there any other place you want to point people to, either your socials or anything else?

Keith Coleman (01:46:47):
I'm KeithColeman on X, please reach out if you have any feedback or want to help us out, whether you may want to work here or want to do something from the outside, we would love to talk.

Jay Baxter (01:46:58):
Yeah, I'm @ _JayBaxter_ at X. Yeah, I think in particular, besides just using Community Notes, it would be great to get more substantial contributions, pull requests, collaborate on projects like Supernotes, I think that's the most exciting type of stuff if people do want to contribute.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:22):
Ship some code guys. Amazing. Guys, thank you so much for doing this.

Keith Coleman (01:47:27):
Thanks for having us, Lenny.

Jay Baxter (01:47:29):

## Transcript

Keith Yandell (00:00):
Every business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going if you believe in the business is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone. And it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.

Lenny (00:44):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Keith Yandell. Keith is a longtime leader at DoorDash, where he's been for about seven years. And in that time, get this, he's led the legal team, the HR team, the marketing team, the customer support team, and currently he leads the BD and corporate development teams. Before DoorDash, he led litigation at Uber. He's also managed folks like Gokul Rajaram, who was previously on this podcast and who suggested that I have Keith on. And damn, was he right. Before I had this chat with Keith, I didn't know that much about him, but now you can count me as a huge Keith fanboy. I suspect you'll feel the same way after you listen to this episode. I'm just going to jump right in and bring you Keith Yandell after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:38):

Keith Yandell (03:15):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (03:17):
First off the bat, I just want to give a big thank you to Gokul Rajaram and Micah Moreau for suggesting you be on the podcast, helping make this happen, and also just suggesting a bunch of questions to ask you. So, I hope you're ready to be in the hot seat.

Keith Yandell (03:29):
Definitely as ready as I'm going to be. And those are two good folks to talk to.

Lenny (03:34):
Awesome. And Gokul's been on the podcast. Maybe we'll get Micah on the podcast at some point. I wanted to start off with a story. Apparently, there's a story of you interviewing what is now your VP of engineering. And I hear that in the interview, you called him an asshole. And more interestingly, he joined DoorDash because you did that. Can you just talk about that story and share that story?

Keith Yandell (03:55):
Yeah, actually, it wasn't during the interview. We were debriefing. And for me, one of the top things I always hear about DoorDash from an executive standpoint when we do the internal survey is it's a "no politics, no asshole" culture. And I'm not one to swear a lot, but after interviewing Ryan Sokol, who's now our VP of eng, he was just kind of aloof. He came off as aloof to me, really curt answers. And I just didn't have a great feeling about him. And I pride myself on being able to discern when people are really engaged or not. And I went to Tony Xu, who's our founder and CEO. I said, "Tony, I think this guy's a jerk. I don't think we want him at the company." And Tony was great. He said, "Keith, I want you to just have dinner with him, please, because I got a completely different impression. And if you have dinner with him, and you still think he's a jerk, we won't hire."

Keith Yandell (04:51):
And so I ended up meeting Ryan down the street. We actually live in the same general area. We went out to dinner, and I started right away. I said, "Ryan, during the interview you kind of seemed like an asshole. Are you an asshole?" And he was so great. It completely changed my perspective in a good two minutes. He wanted to know what he had said. He said, "I'm super embarrassed, and what could I do differently? Regardless of how this works out for me in this circumstance, that's just not how I want to be perceived." And we talked and joked about the things he had done, and he kind of told me the background for how he reacted or why he reacted the way he did. And by the end of the dinner, we ended up staying super late. We had a couple beers afterwards. Ryan and I have become really good friends.

Keith Yandell (05:37):
And six months later, he told me that one of the reasons why he joined DoorDash was that we were going to blackball him potentially from joining just because of his attitude, because his perspective is life's too short to work with people you don't really enjoy, and a lot of people pay lip service. And he knew he was going to be a tough hire for us at the time. And the fact we were willing to go all the way down the path and have someone super qualified but didn't meet the culture bar, for him was what pushed him over the edge to join the company.

Lenny (06:06):
I love that. I love the directness of that meeting, of just like, "Are you an asshole?"

Keith Yandell (06:11):
Think about it, right? And if someone really was a jerk, they probably wouldn't have taken it very well. Right? It's just like when you're interviewing someone, giving them tough feedback after the interview if there's an area of concern, but you otherwise like them, can be a really great way to see how they would interact with you personally as well as how they take feedback. And so that was my learning from the situation, is if you really enjoy an interview, except for maybe something on the culture side, to give the direct feedback and see how people engage.

Lenny (06:39):
This touches on another question I wanted to ask you, which is just about DoorDash's culture, which feels really unique, just feels very driven, very pragmatic. There's a story I heard where when you guys celebrated one of your biggest milestones, you bought the cheapest champagne and plastic flutes, and I think the founders brought that to everyone. Could you just talk about what makes DoorDash's culture so interesting and unique? And maybe if there's a story of just a microcosm of what DoorDash culture is like, that'd be awesome to hear.

Keith Yandell (07:07):
Founder-led companies tend to take on the personality of their founders. And if you spend any time with our founder, Tony Xu, you realize that he's a humble leader. He's competitive. He really wants to win, and he'll do whatever it takes to win. And the example you're referring to, I think, is when we raised our Series D funding, which was a really tough fundraise for us... We had very little runway left. We almost went out of business, and it was a huge relief when we had finally gotten the funding secured.

Keith Yandell (07:40):
And I remember I was in a meeting. I was running policy and communications, among other things, at the time, and I was in the meeting with a couple other folks, and we were talking about the press release strategy. Tony was there. And someone ran down and got some, I think it was Korbel or something champagne and some plastic flutes. And one of the women who was in the meeting with me was going to leave to go put those together. This is a very smart woman, who I think Tony recognized could add more value. And he said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. You stay here. I'm going to go put together the champagne flutes." And he called the other two co-founders, Andy Fang and Stanley Tang. They came, stayed up all night, put together... I don't know... 500 champagne flutes, plastic ones, for this cheap champagne and let the people who are closest to the problem try to work out the comms piece. And I do think that's one great example of the culture.

Keith Yandell (08:31):
The other thing I think that really exemplifies DoorDash's culture is a level of customer obsession. And that manifests in a few different ways. We have a program called WeDash, where, four times, a year all employees are required to go do deliveries. And I love doing it. I do it more than four times a year, and I usually take my daughters with me. And one time, I was out with my daughter, who was eight at the time. We got a delivery, and it was not the best delivery. There's clearly something wrong with the system. We got a sandwich and a coffee, and we're supposed to drive 18 and a half miles to drop it off. And that didn't make sense for the customer. It didn't make sense for us as drivers.

Keith Yandell (09:13):
And she'd gotten to know Tony over the years, and she said, "I really want to call Tony and tell him this thing's broken." "Honey, I like my job. I'd like to keep my job. Can we not call Tony right now?" But she was adamant, and I was so proud of her for feeling so strongly that she wanted to fix this thing that was broken. I figured, "He's not going to answer anyway. We can just call." So call. Tony picks up on the first ring. And I'm like, "Oh, this might go badly." And she just lays into him. She said, "This is going to take us 36 minutes to drop off. The coffee's not going to be hot. How could you allow this experience if you really care about your customers?"

Lenny (09:52):
Whoa.

Keith Yandell (09:52):
And I kind of sucked in my breath and said, "Well, that's how my time at DoorDash ended." But Tony was great. He was like, "Hey, Alice, we have people who do deliveries for months. We have people who deliveries for years, and they're always providing me feedback. And this is one of the most insightful pieces of feedback I've gotten recently. And you've only been dashing for a few different times." And by the time we got home, he'd actually sent an email out to the product organization, calling out the problem, suggesting the fix. And they were already working on it. And that shows the bias to action that I think really is at the heart of DoorDash, alongside that customer obsession. And it's not unusual for Tony to do customer support. It wasn't like just because he heard this from my daughter that he actioned it. He does support every day. And again, this goes back to that level of humility and companies really taking on the ethos of their founder.

Lenny (10:47):
What an awesome story. I want to chat a bit more about the, what is it called? WeDash? Is that the program?

Keith Yandell (10:52):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny (10:52):
So you say that you're supposed to do it how many times a year, four times a year?

Keith Yandell (10:55):
Yeah, at least four times a year.

Lenny (10:56):
And then you said that you do it a lot more often. How often are you doing it? And then, is there any other fun stories of that experience, someone like you delivering someone's sandwich?

Keith Yandell (11:05):
I probably do it once a month.

Lenny (11:06):
Wow.

Keith Yandell (11:07):
And there, there's all kinds of great WeDash stories, but I don't know how interesting they're going to be to the broader public because, for me, it's just about getting out and experiencing the product. I almost always find something that's broken, and I send an email to... We have a Slack channel that's devoted to experiences via WeDash. It's everything from, I found a bug once where it wasn't routing you necessarily the fastest route. It was going using straight line as opposed to road. That was something that we fixed. And for me, the best parts about WeDash are the experiences, the interactions with the restaurants, the interactions with colleagues. So I'll go delivering with Ryan Sokol, the head of engineering. I'll give him a hard time about refining the product and things like that. But that's, by far, my favorite WeDash story, is the one with my daughter.

Lenny (11:57):
That's a good one. So at Airbnb, we actually had a similar program, where Brian wanted everyone to be a host on Airbnb. But as you can imagine, that's much harder. Not everyone is able to. Not everyone has a place to. So it's always kind of a challenge to make people do that. I imagine DoorDash is a lot easier because a lot of people can go around and deliver things. But yeah, such a killer idea, such a good way of dogfooding your product.

Keith Yandell (12:19):
Yeah, it's a good point, but not everyone is able, for a host of reasons, at DoorDash to do it. And so there are alternatives. So you can do customer support, for example, in lieu of actually going and doing deliveries. It's just about making people have empathy and get closer to the product. It's also, going back to the culture point you raise, it's a great way to weed out people that maybe we wouldn't want to work with, right, because not every software engineer wants to hop in their Tesla and go out and deliver McDonald's to some kids. Right? It takes a certain level of humility, a certain amount of customer obsession, to even sign up for that. So we're really vocal during the interview process that this is something that's expected. And it serves as a governor to attract the people that we think are going to be most successful at the company.

Lenny (13:02):
I love that. Imagine all your programs have the Dash in there somewhere. Something Dash.

Keith Yandell (13:07):
We try. I think when I was head of a marketing, we did a much worse job. I think we're doing much better now.

Lenny (13:13):
Nice. And Airbnb, it was always Air Something. Okay. So, I think one of the most interesting things about you and your background, and maybe unusual things, is the number of teams that you've led over your time at DoorDash. I have a list here. So over your time at DoorDash, you've led the HR team. You've led the customer support team, led the sales team, the marketing team. Now you lead the BD and corp dev team. Initially, I think, you were chief legal officer. So here's my question. As someone that, I imagine, doesn't have a ton of expertise and experience in a lot of these areas, how are you able to credibly lead these teams? And I ask partly because as a founder, you have to learn how to lead teams and people that you don't actually know what they're doing as well as they do. And so I'm just curious what you've learned about being able to lead teams in such disparate skill sets and functions.

Keith Yandell (14:03):
Yeah, the one thing I'll say is, I did not run sales. That's maybe one of the very few non-technical functions I did not lead. But the question is a good one. And I had massive imposter syndrome the first time Tony asked me to take on something that I wasn't a subject matter expert in. And I told him I didn't want to do it. And he had me read this book called Range by David Epstein. And the general thesis is that generalists are better than specialists. And it goes through all these examples of about how Nobel Prize winners are usually amazing in something other than the field that they actually win the Nobel Prize in.

Keith Yandell (14:38):
And Tony believes pretty deeply in this philosophy, and the way he explained it to me is as follows. If you want to achieve a 10x outcome, hiring someone that's an expert in the field, it's maybe unlikely you're going to achieve that 10x outcome, because they're likely to do things the way things have always been done. So you might achieve incremental benefits, but the odds of completely reinventing the system and doing something that's vastly superior to others is much lower. And he said, "I know you don't know how to do this stuff. That's why I'm putting you in the role." And I said, "Okay."

Keith Yandell (15:10):
So, first thing he helped me do was believe that I could add value here. And then, the second thing for me was to go out and find the best people that really were the subject matter experts, and add the value I could to help them be successful. And I found that they were actually really attracted to wanting to work with someone like me, who came into the interview process and said, "Good news, bad news. I don't know your field anywhere near as well as you do. Here's the ways I intend to help you. Here's what I think you can provide. And at the end of the day, I'm going to get out of your way." And that's really proven true. So, I ran marketing. Hired initially a head of brand, Kofi, who now is our CMO. Hired ahead of legal, who's now our GC, Tia Sherringham. And these people have really just excelled at their function and, with the warmup that I was able to provide, have really proven that they're much better at the jobs than I was.

Lenny (16:08):
You don't strike me as someone that is trying to build empires and take over all these teams. I imagine this kind of came at you because you've been doing a great job at other things. Is that how it worked? And, I guess, is there anything, any lessons there that you can take away?

Keith Yandell (16:21):
Yeah, hundred percent. I run a 12-person org today. So I've gone from running 1,500 people in the company to 12. And for me, people talk a lot about hiring people better than you are. People don't talk a lot about what you do when you hire those people. And if you really care about the company and your long-term brand as an individual, as a manager, you realize what you want to do when you find the person that's better than you is you want to slowly get out of the way. And it's really good for the company. It's my favorite part of my job, is seeing people that either I've hired or managed be successful on their own.

Keith Yandell (17:02):
And I think it's a big part of our success, is this desire to be successful, regardless of who's in charge. And that comes from the fact when I joined DoorDash, we were getting our tails kicked. We were in fourth place in the space. Uber had just launched food and rocket to market share leadership. And I think that was really good for us as a company because we realized unless we all worked together, and it wasn't about who was doing what or things like that, we weren't going to have a shot at being successful. And I think that ethos has really pervaded and persisted since then.

Lenny (17:40):
Yeah. I think most people don't realize DoorDash actually has the biggest market share in food delivery. Imagine that's still true. I've always seen these line charts of market share, and DoorDash is always the top. And I think people kind of think Uber Eats is winning, but it's not true.

Keith Yandell (17:52):
Yeah, I mean, the category charts I've seen are consistent with what you said by a pretty wide margin. But we try not to focus on things like that. We try to focus on the customer experience. And it's humbling in our space because we're doing millions and millions and millions of deliveries a day, and those deliveries will go wrong, no matter how hard you try. And we read those experiences. We do customer support, and we understand that there's a long ways to go. So we're just getting started, and we know that.

Lenny (18:21):
You mentioned that you ran this 1,500-person org at one point, and something that I've heard you do, that helps you do that, is you have this document that you put together that kind of explains how to work with Keith, and also, just broadly, how things work at DoorDash. Can you talk about this document, and why you thought it was necessary, and kind of the impact something like this has had? And then we're going to share a link to a redacted version of this in the show notes.

Keith Yandell (18:45):
One thing I've learned is it's super hard to scale culture, especially when you're growing as fast as DoorDash has since I joined. We were two or three X'ing the company, from a head count perspective, for the vast majority of my time every year. And so one thing I noticed is, it's hard to come into a place and be new and understand how things work and what it means to be successful there. And so the idea was to do our best to scale that. And one thing that Tony taught me is one thing that scales really well is written work [inaudible 00:19:16]. And so I put together this document. There's three basic subject matters. It's my expectations slash what I've seen as traits in successful people within the company.

Keith Yandell (19:28):
Two are how I can improve, like basically, feedback I've gotten in things I'm working on. For example, I'm a litigator by training, and so I tend to argue about things, even if I agree with people to the test levels of conviction. And I got feedback from my team that was really confusing because I'd be arguing against something, and then we would execute that exact thing. And so I try to be transparent about that and explain how I work through problems, but also in saying, "Hey, this is something I'm trying to improve on, is not being quite so argumentative for sport." And then it talks about what my commitments are to team. So, "I'm committed to finding you your next job even if that's not at DoorDash. Life's too short to be in a job you don't like," things like that.

Lenny (20:16):
I've heard from a few people how impactful this document ended up being. I guess, what impact have you seen this have on the org that you've run in the company and then, yeah, any other examples of just why this is powerful? Because I imagine some people listening are like, "Oh, I should do something like this."

Keith Yandell (20:32):
Yeah, I mean, for me, one of an executive's main jobs is to attract and retain top talent. And going back to why people have joined DoorDash, Kofi Amoo-Gottfried, who's now our CMO, joined me as head of brand when I was running marketing. And it's comical because this person is a legend in the marketing space, and I had no idea what was going on. And so convincing him to join, I was really nervous about. And the point where he decided to join, I had sent him this document. He wanted to know what it was like to work with me. I said, "Well, I've actually written that down."

Keith Yandell (21:01):
And he later told me that that was a really important factor for him, that someone was so transparent about their areas for growth, how they thought they could be helpful, and he liked the fact that I knew that I didn't know. And so he knew he was going to have a lot of autonomy on the role, and that was really important to him. But more broadly within the organization, how it's been helpful is just being able to have people engage with me in a way, and with the company in a way that is so consistent with the culture from day one. I've had people come and tell me, that I'd never met before, that they'd read the doc, even if they're on a different team, and just how helpful it's been to try to acclimate to this fast-paced environment, where you're learning while drinking from the fire hose, effectively.

Lenny (21:44):
Yeah, that makes sense. Touching a little bit on it, you talked about all these amazing people you've led and how you've been able to do that. Something else I've heard that you do that's pretty unusual is you help people that you manage find their next job, which may not necessarily be within the company, maybe at another company. You kind of help them land it and find something else to do. I've never heard of that before, really. I'd love to hear why you decided to do that, how you do that, and just the kind of impact, second-order impact, maybe, that has, maybe that leads you to be doing this.

Keith Yandell (22:15):
It wasn't a calculated decision why I started doing it. Then I gave it a lot of thought because I was afraid that I might get some blowback when people started taking jobs elsewhere. And as I thought about it, I realized it really is better for the company to have that type of open dialogue with people that work on your team. I think that's true for a few reasons. In this "How to work with Keith" document, I say, "I will help you find your next job." And what that means is, number one, people are going to be transparent with you, or more transparent, if they're looking for something else or if they're not happy. That's going to allow you to lay the foundation for a backfill so you're much less likely to get surprised when someone leaves.

Keith Yandell (22:59):
Number two, what's going to happen is if someone runs a blind reference on me at this point with someone that I've managed, which in the current environment is more and more common, people diligencing the managers, what they're going to hear is, "Keith's going to put you first." And I think that's really motivating for a lot of people. So if you're thinking on a five-, 10-year horizon of your career as a manager, whether you're an entrepreneur hiring people into your company, whether you're a product manager who's trying to build a team, building that long-term reputation, I think people take much too shortsighted perspective on that.

Keith Yandell (23:34):
And so now if I get a blind reference, people are going to hear that, "It's not all about the company. It's not all about Keith. It's about you and your career," and that's going to pay back 10x. Maybe you lose one really talented person, but they probably shouldn't be there anyway. They're probably going to leave anyway. And this way, you can participate in that and really drive value for them, as well as for the company in the future, by creating a much better reputation for the group of managers. So it's been really helpful for me. I keep in touch with a lot of people who have left, and we get a lot of boomerangs, too. There's a lot of people who leave DoorDash and come back. And that's something I love seeing because it shows that people have gone out and seen what else is out there and realized this is the right place for them.

Lenny (24:20):
Can you talk a bit about how you operationalize this? Because this is just out there. "Tell me if you're thinking about a new job, and I will talk to you through your options and help you find something." Or is there anything else there for folks that maybe want to offer this to their employees?

Keith Yandell (24:33):
So, first of all, I put it in this document. And so I say how I run one-on-ones in my "how to work with Keith" document, and the last 10 minutes of my one-on-ones are career development conversations. That's a really fertile ground for having the discussion. But for particularly more senior folks, if I get pinged for a GC job, or when I would get pinged by a recruiter for a GC job, I would forward that to Tia Sherringham, who's now our general counsel but was basically head of legal for years before she got the general counsel title. And I'd say, "Hey, Tia, I don't know when this job's going to be available here. I'm still liking what I'm doing. I think I'm still adding value. If you think it's time for you to leave, I think this is a really good opportunity."

Lenny (25:11):
Wow, that's [inaudible 00:25:12].

Keith Yandell (25:11):
And I say, in addition to that, "You're going to learn the questions they asked during the interview process. You're going to learn what type of qualifications they're looking for. And if I'm not getting you that experience, you can tell me." And thankfully for me, Tia decided to stay and has now grown into the general counsel of DoorDash, and doing a much better job at the role than I ever did. But she had the opportunity to leave, and I think she learned from some of those in-bounds and the experiences she had.

Lenny (25:40):
Wow. That's amazing, that your bosses forward you recruiter pitches to go work somewhere else.

Keith Yandell (25:48):
Think it made her want to stay. Right? If I wasn't invested in her success, she could have left any time and gotten a job, super qualified. But I think she felt a sense of loyalty based on my sense of loyalty, and I think it worked out best for all involved.

Lenny (26:04):
I love it. This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the road map, their OKR process, getting internal feedback. And essentially, their whole product development process is done within Coda.

Lenny (26:44):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location, regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special, limited time offer just for start-ups.

Lenny (27:23):
Something else I hear about you, which I'm sensing as we chat more and more, and I could see why this is true, is that on the DoorDash kind of C-suite and board meeting and board in general, you play this really strong unifying force that helps the group come to fast decisions on really complicated topics. And I'm curious. One, would you agree with that? And two, what is it that you do that helps a lot of strongly opinionated people come to decisions on really complicated decisions?

Keith Yandell (27:51):
I hope that's true. I think that, for me, it all comes down to empathy. And what I mean by that is, you have to understand what different people's motivations are in the room. Different people are goaled on different things. People come from different life experiences and different work experiences. And I think it's really important to make each person feel heard. We had a situation, for example, where we were deciding between a trade-off between two business lines. It was a profitability question for one business line, to make one business line much more profitable to do a certain partnership, but it would come at the expense of the growth of another business line that was more nascent.

Keith Yandell (28:30):
And so it's hard when you get the GMs for all these businesses together, and they have very strong perspectives and good reasons on both sides about why path A is better profitability, path B is better for growth. And they're arguing very strenuously, in part because they want to hit their numbers, in part because they believe it. One thing I found super effective in those contexts is I try to ask the other side. So, let's take the profitability side. I ask them to make the growth case. I say, "Tell me the three best reasons why we should actually focus on growth here." That generates instant empathy for the other side. And sometimes, they'll even persuade themselves as they're talking and say, "I think you're right that we should focus on growth here. We can achieve this profitability measure later" or vice versa. And so generating empathy and having empathy for the other side, understanding how they're goaled and what they're bringing to the conversation, I think is the first step to having those really tough conversations.

Lenny (29:25):
I love that. What other steps are there? I like that as a first step. Is there anything else you have that you end up finding is really helpful there?

Keith Yandell (29:32):
Sometimes these conversations can go on forever. Right? People just want to keep going back to an argument they've already made, because they're not willing to settle, and there needs to be someone that says, "All right. We got to be clear on who the decision maker is here. If we haven't reached a consensus, who's the tiebreaker?" And a lot of time that's our CEO, Tony Xu, but a lot of times it's the GM for a certain business line or a head of product or a head of engineering, depending on the decision to be made. I think being really clear about, "Hey, we're all going to come together. We're going to have a healthy debate. We're going to make sure everyone's perspectives are heard. We're going to try to reach consensus, but the end of the day, here's the person that's going to make the decision, and we're going to make it on this time horizon. And once the decision is made, we're going to [inaudible 00:30:16]."

Keith Yandell (30:17):
And I think that having someone that's in the room that has run a lot of the functions that are trying to articulate the perspective is helpful, and someone who's been at the company as long as I have and given up as much as I have... Right? To your point earlier, everyone knows I'm not trying to build an empire. I'm trying to find a way to win. And I think it gives me some credibility to call the question, figure out who decision maker is, set a time line, and move on. The only way it works is if there's empathy on both sides.

Lenny (30:46):
This is great, so I just took a few notes. One is there's essentially the steel man component. Have them steel man the other side, argue why that's the better decision. Clarify a decision maker. Make it clear like, "There's the tiebreaker. If we can't get there, this person's going to make the decision." And then create a time horizon of like, "We need to make a decision by this time." Is there anything else, before we move on to a different question?

Keith Yandell (31:08):
I think that's the right framework. I can tell you're product guy. You're very good at distilling it down to the essence. I think that's a good summary.

Lenny (31:16):
Yeah, you got to do it. You mentioned the one-on-one meetings. And I took a note on this, actually, and I wanted to come back to it. You mentioned at the end of your one-on-one meetings you have this kind of coaching career conversation. Is there anything else you could share about just your approach to one-on-one meetings, your agenda or how you think about one-on-ones?

Keith Yandell (31:32):
This is super tactical. It's something I think is really important, is I'm very clear, in the document we talked about earlier, about how I like to work, is I demand feedback for me. And so we set aside time during one-on-ones where I want the feedback. First, constructive feedback. And I expect it, and if you don't give it to me, I'm going to press you on constructive feedback. And then I give feedback. I tell this to managers all the time. If you create a space where you require constructive feedback, it's a lot easier to give feedback. One of the top things I hear from managers, especially new managers, they don't like giving constructive feedback. They want to be positive. They want to be liked and things like that. And so it's a nice way to create space to have that dialogue.

Keith Yandell (32:15):
And that's something I actually learned from Travis, when I was at Uber. We had a system called T3 B3, where during reviews or pulse check-ins, you'd have to say three positives about your manager and three constructive pieces of feedback for your manager. And the first time I did it, I just did the T, the tough things, for my manager, who was the general counsel at the time. And Travis came over, and, "This is totally unacceptable. You have to provide constructive feedback," which made me super uncomfortable but created the right environment, where people could have these tough conversations because, "My manager can't get mad at me, because she knows the CEO's going to come give me a hard time if I don't provide some constructive feedback." And I think having that as an expectation is super important to building open lines of communication.

Lenny (33:05):
Wow. I like this T3 B3. So T is top good things and B is three bad things.

Keith Yandell (33:10):
Yeah.

Lenny (33:11):
Cool. I'm trying to imagine you in this meeting with the CMO you mentioned, and them having to give you constructive feedback. That's always hard, even though you expect it. Is there anything else you do to help people feel comfortable giving you hard feedback in meetings like that?

Keith Yandell (33:26):
You have to thank them for it. Right? I mean, there's a saying, "Feedback is a gift," but you have to say stuff, and you have to action. And that's one thing I've found that can be really demotivating for folks. A lot of these companies have these pulse surveys, or they talk about what the company can do better, and they put the results on the screen, and, "We're going to work on it," and that's the end of it.

Keith Yandell (33:50):
And that was something I learned early on at DoorDash that people didn't like, unless you were going to come back and say, "Hey, this was our lowest performing area in the pulse survey. Here are the three things we did to action it," because that's how you would treat the business. Right? If we got feedback from a customer or from another business line, you would say, "Heard it. We're going to come back and report out on what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to track the progress." And so I think that's really important when you receive feedback. You have to show people that you're actioning it and say, "I heard this from you. Checking in. Am I doing better? Here are the things that I've changed." And so making sure that there's that feedback loop, I think, is another important part of creating the right structure for a good, healthy culture.

Lenny (34:33):
Another guest on the podcast had the same exact advice for getting feedback, and the way he described it is you want to be enthusiastic about like, "Thank you so much for that." And the way he described it is even though you're melting inside because you don't want to hear, "Thank you so much. That was so helpful."

Keith Yandell (34:48):
It's really good advice.

Lenny (34:49):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about the DoorDash kind of journey. There's been a lot of high highs with DoorDash. There's been some low lows. I know that there was a funding round at one point, where it was very precarious and may not have worked out. Question I have for you around that is just, leading through hardships and through tough times, what have you learned, as a leader, about how to lead through challenging times? And ask partly because a lot of companies are going through that right now. It's pretty hard for a lot of folks out there, a lot of layoffs. And so yeah, I'm curious what you've learned about leading through challenging times.

Keith Yandell (35:23):
Yeah. I'm going to regurgitate some advice I got from some folks on our board at the same time, when we were having really tough times, which I really didn't like hearing at the time, but I was kind of new to the space. And that is, "Tough times make companies," for a host of reasons. I mean, this is super healthy for the start-ups out there right now. It's because, number one, you're going to find out who the mercenaries are on the team, that are people that are there for the mission, versus they're there because they think this is going to be a quick road to riches. We had a lot of people leave the company when Uber launched food, and we fell quickly behind. And that was good for us because the people that stayed were there because they wanted to work on this team, on this mission, and they really believed in it.

Keith Yandell (36:11):
The second thing is it forces discipline. It's a good thing to focus on unit economics. And we didn't have the funding that a lot of our competitors did, which forced us to be super focused on our unit economics and efficient and serve the customer in unique ways from the start. And I think a lot of our success, even to this day, emanates from those tough times. The last thing I'll say is if you're a founder, and you're looking for talent, tough times are great because there's a lot more talent out there. I saw... I think it might have been Bill Gurley. Someone tweeted, "This is the best time in recent memory, since 2008, to start a company." And that really resonated with me because there's a lot of talented folks out there who are looking for their next thing. And three years ago, it was tough to find talent. And so I think there's a lot to like about tough times.

Keith Yandell (36:59):
The last thing I'll say is, one thing that I found surprising is, from our surveys internally, people actually like crises at DoorDash. And I dug into that recently, and I was trying to figure out [inaudible 00:37:10] like these crises, and it's because there's singularity of focus. You know what the job is. You know you're going to get whatever resources the company has, when you're focused on the main thing. And these tough economic times will create that work. It's crystal clear. You got to cut, burn, and everyone's going to be doing what they need to do to achieve that outcome. And I think talented folks really like that, one, resourcing, and two, singularity of focus about what the main thing is. And crises manifests those for folks.

Lenny (37:42):
It's interesting that there's all these benefits to tough times. It's hard to recreate artificially. Reminds me a little bit of Frank Slootman, I think his name... and his book Amp It Up, where he talks a lot about the importance of urgency, always creating urgency. And obviously, a downturn like we have today is an urgent situation. Have you found that to be true, the power of creating urgency? And then, is there something you've learned about how to create that urgency at a company [inaudible 00:38:07]?

Keith Yandell (38:07):
Yeah, this is something Tony's talked about since the day I joined, and he's very good at, frustratingly good, at that, because just when you think you've achieved the goal, the goal might go up. It might get shorter if you're from the product side. And speaking specifically on the product, compound interest is a really hard concept to fully explain to people, to make them truly appreciate. But that's something Tony is fantastic at, which is, he understands that by pushing a road map up, even by a week, if you can continuously push up what you ship by a week, you're going to end up lapping competitors who are just one week behind because you're going to start the next thing a week sooner, and you're getting that 1.1, 1.01x return. And then it grows and grows and grows.

Keith Yandell (38:51):
And he's as good as I've ever seen, combined with our president, Christopher Payne, at creating that sense of urgency and just pushing people. "Do we really need to test this thing again or can we ship it? How can we move that much faster?" Even if it's by a small margin, understanding that you can compound those gains over time has been really impactful for our success.

Lenny (39:11):
I saw the same thing at Airbnb. It feels like, "Things are going well. Maybe we could take a little break," but it's constant just like, "How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? Okay, what's next? We launched this thing. Let's move on." And it feels like such a pattern across companies that do really well, is the founders continuing to keep that pressure on.

Keith Yandell (39:28):
I remember our IPO day. We had this thing. I had to wake up super early. It was a virtual bell ringing, and the second it was over, we had our weekly business review, and there were tough questions being asked. There was not champagne being passed around. I mean, people were in a good mood, but it wasn't like, "Wow, this is so great." It's just like, "Hey, how are we going to serve our customers today?" And I thought that was really emblematic of, "Hey, if we take too deep of a breath and are patting ourselves on the back..." It reminds me of the saying, "Somewhere, someone out there is practicing, and when you meet them, they will beat you." It's the same kind of thing. It's if you take too long to be self-congratulatory, you're going to fall behind the people who are still hungry. So it's important to stay hungry.

Lenny (40:12):
Wow. Reminds me, I think it's Bill Gates talking about someone's in a garage building the next Microsoft, and he's always trying to stay ahead of them.

Keith Yandell (40:18):
So true.

Lenny (40:20):
The other thing this makes me think about is just, it's wild that founders... like Airbnb founders have been at this 15 years. Tony, I'm not exactly sure. We're probably a similar amount of time. It's just like they have to keep that pressure on within the company and also keep themselves motivated and excited and continuing to push. Just such a hard path. There's benefits to being that founder, but it's such a challenging life, too.

Keith Yandell (40:42):
Yeah, I think it can be lonely to be a founder, for sure. I know that Tony's tried to develop a community, for him, of people who are similarly situated from other companies, and that's been helpful. And the real founders that I've come across, that drive, though, is something they can't turn off. They don't have to try to keep it, because there's a handful of traits I've seen that are pretty common. One is a level of obsessiveness. Two is hypercompetitiveness. And I think they're good at manufacturing straw men, even if everyone's saying nice things. It's like Michael Jordan used to take things out of context and make bulletin board material. There's definitely an element of that in the great founders that I've come across. And there's just a raw curiosity. So it's the competitiveness, but the curiosity in learning how things are working, and those all come together to create a drive that just never stops.

Lenny (41:33):
That resonates. Coming back to the DoorDash journey a little bit, I imagine the pandemic was kind of this microcosm of high highs and low lows, where, as an external observer, felt like everyone needed DoorDash immediately, and it was just probably the best thing for your business. On the other hand, I imagine you had to scale like crazy and keep the wheels on the bus through this time. Can you just talk about that part of history for DoorDash?

Keith Yandell (41:55):
I mean, it was just a wild rollercoaster. We were trying to get ready to go public, first of all, and so there was that overlay. And then, what you saw was our volume dropped right away, like the first or second day of lockdown. And I was like, "Well, this is going out of business because no one wants to order food from restaurants anymore." People didn't know how COVID was transmitted. And so just basically volume dropped out a cliff. And I was like, "Oh, went from a super high. We're getting ready to IPO. Super low. Volume's going to zero." And then, all of a sudden, volume doubled. And that was really exciting for a second, till we realized that our customer support center... I was running support at the time. All the support centers around the world shut down. So you're doubling volume. You have no one to serve it, from a customer support perspective.

Keith Yandell (42:39):
And our infrastructure, we weren't planning to grow that fast. We didn't think there was a chance of two or three exiting in a very short window. And so every Friday night, the app would crash. And if you're running customer support, there's few things you like less than the app going down. Set aside what it means for the customers and for the business. Selfishly, it's just super painful. The irony of it was, is our NPS was going up and that people were just so grateful to have the product, to be able to safely get the things they needed, for people to be able to earn money at times when they really needed it because maybe their job had been shut down, or they weren't allowed to go in. It became a really essential service for folks. And that was really motivating for me, and I think for the team, is to really be able to fulfill the big part of our mission of empowering local economies in a very unique way in a very special time.

Keith Yandell (43:30):
And the last thing I'll say on the pandemic was, one of my most vivid DoorDash memories was being on a Zoom call, where we were trying to figure out what to do to help restaurants. And again, we were trying to go public. And Tony made a decision, and I admit, I'm on the wrong set of history. I was arguing that this seemed extreme, just to cut commissions by basically 100 million bucks for restaurants, to help them stay in business. And I'm like, "Hold on. We're trying to go public. This is going to completely change the bottom line perspective. No one's asking us to do this."

Keith Yandell (44:06):
And Tony says, "Keith, you think too short-term." He's like, "This is the right thing to do." And reminded me of the Ted Lasso quote, which is, "Doing the right thing is never the wrong thing." And talk about how sometimes there's healthy debate. He didn't want to hear any debate on this one. He said, "Just shut it down." And he's like, "Founder-led decision. This is the right thing to do. We're going to cut these commissions." And I woke up the next morning and never been happier to kind of been overruled in a debate before than there. It was just such a meaningful moment for the company, and I was so proud to be a part of the organization.

Lenny (44:40):
Is there anything else you took away from that experience of just living through this up and down of pandemic times at DoorDash?

Keith Yandell (44:48):
It actually reminds me of the best advice I got when we were having our first kid. And everyone thinks they're going to give you the insight that's really going to be transformative. But one that stuck with me is, "For better and for worse, everything's temporary. So the highs, you can't get too high. The lows, you can't get too low." That really resonated with me during that period of time, as well as this general idea that you have to try to find opportunities to reach the potential for the business. And decisions sometimes have to be made in very short time horizons, and being able to seize those moments, I think, is really important.

Lenny (45:24):
I have a few questions about product that I want to get to. But one bigger question about DoorDash is, you've been involved in a lot of the bigger fundraising moments, DoorDash. I think you've worked probably with every major firm out there, raised large dollar amounts for DoorDash. Are there any memories or lessons that you can share from that experience?

Keith Yandell (45:44):
We've definitely tried to raise from everyone, been told no many, many times. I mean, raising the Series D was really difficult. Tony and I worked together very closely on that one. And there was a lull in the tech market publicly, and it translated pretty quickly to the private markets. And people didn't believe in either the TAM or the profitability of the business model. And it was difficult. I think one thing that process taught me is after we raised the D, almost every round, or I think every round ended up being led by someone who had passed in a previous round. And that was because we put up numbers we were highly confident we were going to hit.

Keith Yandell (46:25):
I'm an operating partner at a venture firm on the side, and I see that most people put up stretch plans, but they [inaudible 00:46:31]. But that was just not in our DNA. We wanted to make sure that we put forth numbers that we knew were going to hit, and that cost us some dilution upfront in the form of lower valuations, I think. And there's just a trust that builds from that, where when we tell people we're going to do something, that they have conviction that we're going to do it. And I would trade a couple of points of dilution for that level of trust with the right investor base over time.

Lenny (46:58):
For founders that are going through fundraising right now, maybe having a hard time, any just advice from that period for founders, yeah, that are having a hard time raising these days?

Keith Yandell (47:08):
It's fortunate because you only need one yes. Right? And you see all the people post the how many rejections they got. Every business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going, if you believe in the business, is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone, and it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.

Lenny (48:00):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit to a few product questions. Most listeners to this podcast are product builders, growth people, founders, and so I have a couple questions here. Today you're currently leading the corp dev and BD team, and I imagine you work closely with the product team. And so I'm curious what you've found to be an effective relationship between BD and product and from the experience you've had at DoorDash doing that.

Keith Yandell (48:26):
Yeah, I joke that our head of product, Rajat Shroff, is actually the head of BD, because he's both interested and good at it. And to do impactful BD, the two really have to go hand-in-glove. So when I think through how to make that relationship work, the first challenge I've confronted, and maybe mistake I made, is trying to figure out what the right cadence is. When do you bring in the product team? Because if you bring them in too early on a deal that really has no chance of getting done, you waste valuable cycles. And our tech talent is our most precious resource, probably, at DoorDash. And so you have to be really mindful about when you bring them in. But if you bring them in too late, it may be a situation where you've given on terms that you really shouldn't have, and that can be really detrimental to the partnership as well.

Keith Yandell (49:17):
So I think one thing to do is just give visibility. So without actually bringing them and having a full discussion, like, "Here's the pipeline. If you see things that are super impactful, let us know. If you think things you're not so sure that are going to make a difference, please let us know." That's been really helpful.

Keith Yandell (49:32):
Another thing that Rajat's taught me is the importance of building platforms, and whenever you can. So what we used to do is, I'd go out and negotiate a deal. We had a lot of deals around DashPass, which is our subscription product, and I'd ask the product team to go build a bespoke thing for this particular partnership, Chase or whatever partnership we were negotiating at the time. And Rajat said, "Why don't you figure out what the scalable solution is for this? We will build you a product. You won't need to come ask us every time to build something. And then you'll know the parameters in which you can negotiate. You can negotiate a better velocity. We might spend more time on the first version of this, but very little effort for the next. And we'll have a high return on the product hours and the engineering hours spent." And so that was a super valuable insight that I garnered from him, is to try to figure out how to create these type of platforms.

Lenny (50:27):
Any other lessons of just building an effective BD team within a product company, especially at the scale you're at?

Keith Yandell (50:35):
A few other things. Number one... This is something else that Rajat taught me. One of our core values is, "Dream big, start small." And he really brought that to the BD product org. And there were some painful times. We invested heavily in a partnership with a hotel chain. We thought we were going to build, "Hey, we're going to make sure that this is the new dine-in experience when you're at a hotel. We can actually replace room service." And asked for a lot of product worked. And it was a total flop. And the realization I had is that we should have gone out and tested this at one hotel with just some hacky operations and seen what the uptick was. And what I would've realized is this particular hotel chain was franchised. So even though corporate thought this was an important thing they were going to prioritize, if the franchisee doesn't care about it, they're not going to give you the visibility, in room or otherwise, to make it work. So we built all this great integration [inaudible 00:51:32] that was totally wasted because the operations weren't right.

Keith Yandell (51:35):
And I have probably two or three other examples of situations where I learned I should have just gone out and stood out front with a promo code, and handed it out in certain forums, and seen if that changed customer behavior, before going and asking for the product resources. And Rajat correctly was like, "Hey, this is how we have to think about these things going forward." So yeah, definitely building platforms, "Dream big, starts small," use operations to test a thesis around a deal before you actually expend the product resources, I think has been super helpful. And then, the last thing would be to engage early, but not too early, on deal opportunities.

Lenny (52:12):
It's interesting how the advice of doing things that don't scale just continues to be useful, even at the scale of a DoorDash. Like you said, you could just stand out there and see if people want room service through DoorDash before building a whole solution.

Keith Yandell (52:24):
Yeah, early DoorDash, that was a core value. Do things that don't scale. It's as relevant today as it was then.

Lenny (52:31):
Same at Airbnb, is something the founders brought up all the time. And speaking of that, another area that you have a lot of expertise on is legal. So, you led legal for a while at DoorDash. And I was thinking, as thinking about this question, "I wonder what's more difficult, to be head of legal at Airbnb or head of legal at DoorDash," both fraught businesses and ideas. But we'll avoid that question for now. So my question is just legal and product. It's always this interesting relationship, how much legal has say over what happens versus how much product has final decision-making powers. Any lessons there about just how to set up a product and legal relationship within a software business?

Keith Yandell (53:12):
Yeah. And both for the product folks that are listening as well as the entrepreneurs who want to be founders, I've had the pleasure of working with two founders who are very product-driven, product-first folks, in Travis and Tony. And I've found that the way they engage on the legal side is with the curiosity I referenced earlier, which is they're both hyper curious, and they will ask questions until they understand the law in the particular area about as well as the lawyers. And then they will apply a first principles product mindset to their understanding of the law, and they will push the lawyers to make sure that they're not being overly conservative, which sometimes they can be.

Keith Yandell (53:51):
And so, when you're on the product team, especially if you're in a consumer-facing business, it may not be as pronounced for SaaS businesses, but if you're in a consumer-facing business, working on a consumer-facing product, you had better have at least a general understanding of what type of regulations are going to apply to your business, and what type of constraints there are, and how to push those constraints. Yeah, and so for me it's just about that level of curiosity and actually engaging in the profession. Right? There's nothing magic about the law. There's a finite number of things that you can learn. And just like all the other functions I've learned, I think you can engage them in a way, till you are proficient and actually really accretive to your business.

Lenny (54:31):
Keith, this has been incredible. I can see why people want to work for you, why they keep giving you more teams to run. I learned a ton. I'm really excited for folks to listen to this and learn from you. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, or if they want to reach out or learn more, where do you point them? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Keith Yandell (54:50):
If you want to find me, LinkedIn is the place you can locate me. You can locate me there. I don't do any other social media. It is maybe unusual in this day and age, but that's my preferred medium. And then, as far as being helpful, always looking for referrals for great people. That would be the number one thing. And everyone has an opportunity to use our product. So if you have product feedback, I always welcome that as well.

Lenny (55:16):
For folks that maybe want to join DoorDash after hearing this, is there specific roles you're hiring for? Anything you want to share there, folks that might be interested?

Keith Yandell (55:24):
Yeah, I mean, select roles definitely on the product and engineering side is a place we're focused right now. But even if there's not a role open today, I like meeting great people. I've found that building relationships over time, even when you're not looking, is impactful.

Lenny (55:37):
Awesome. Keith, thank you so much again for doing this.

Keith Yandell (55:40):
Thanks, Lenny.

# Why not asking for what you want is holding you back | Kenneth Berger (exec coach, first PM @Slack)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You were famously the first PM at Slack and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching.

Kenneth Berger (00:00:05):
For me, the impact was about making this work sustainable so that we're not burning out or selling out, but actually able to pursue these hard goals that we have in startups.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
What we're going to be talking about today is your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator and seven plus years as a coach.

Kenneth Berger (00:00:23):
The core idea is ask for what you want. Turns out when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.

Speaker 3 (00:00:30):
You're hired.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
How do you know that this is something you need to be working on?

Kenneth Berger (00:00:34):
If you're more in the people pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind. And if you're sort of more in the control freak camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, "Go do this now."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
How do you know what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:00:46):
Complaints are great inspiration. Every complaint implies a dream. Let me envision a better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. See what it's like to not be sort of living in fear all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):
Today, my guest is Kenneth Berger. Kenneth coaches startup leaders to help them avoid burnout and live the life that they want. He was the first product manager at Slack and spent over 10 years in tech before transitioning into coaching. His core focus with leaders is to help them learn how to ask for what they want. This sounds really simple, but as you'll hear in our chat, this one skill is at the core of so many of the struggles that people have in their career and in their life.

(00:01:28):
Kenneth shares a ton of very tactical advice to help you figure out what it is you want, how to overcome the resistance that comes with asking for what you want, how to actually ask for what you want effectively, why the most important step is hearing the response that you get when you ask for what you want and all of the things that will change in your life if you get better at this one skill.

(00:01:50):
Kenneth also shares the story of him being fired three times from Slack, which is hilarious. With that, I bring you Kenneth Berger after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:04:20):
Kenneth, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Kenneth Berger (00:04:23):
Yay. thanks for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:30):
I love that, yay. That should be a tradition that everyone goes with. I love that. So we originally met when I was doing a post on being a first product manager at a company. You were famously the first PM at Slack, and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching, which is what you do now. What we're going to be talking about today is something that you described to me as, quote, your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator, and seven plus years as a coach to startup leaders.

(00:04:59):
And the core idea is simply asking for what you want, which sounds really simple. So let me just start broadly just why have you found that this skill, this one idea is so core to so many of the challenges that people run into in work and in life?

Kenneth Berger (00:05:19):
If I had to answer in one word, it would be integrity. I think that it's one of these funny things where everyone thinks they already know how to ask for what they want. We all ask for what we want. We order our coffee in the morning and we all think we have integrity. No one walks around thinking, "I'm lying to myself all the time or lying to others certainly." And yet we tend to fool ourselves a little bit. When it comes to are we really pursuing the things that we want in life? And I think to me, the flip side of that is sort of the reason that the stakes around asking for what you want are so high because we can't guarantee we're going to get what we want.

(00:05:59):
But if we're asking for it regularly, if we're listening to the response, we're expecting the nose we get from the world, then we can get the sense of, "Yeah, I'm honoring what's important to me. I'm honoring the world's response and I'm moving forward towards what I want." And if we don't do that, "Well, then we're fooling ourselves that we're actually moving towards of what we want." There tends to be all these unexpected secondary and tertiary effects that come out of that of stress and frustration, and unhappiness because of course, asking for what we want, pursuing what's important to us in life is just one of the most important things of fulfillment, of what's important in achieving our purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):
What are just some challenges that people have in their life and career that are just rooted in doing this badly? Not asking for what you want, not knowing what you want.

Kenneth Berger (00:06:47):
For me with clients, I think what I'm often looking for are just kind of this sense of being stuck because everybody has got frustrations. Everybody gets nervous at work sometimes. But if we're in the same stuck place week after week after week in our coaching sessions, probably you're trying the same thing and not getting any different results. It's that definition of insanity thing.

(00:07:11):
So really I look at that and say, "Okay. Maybe you're asking for what you want." Maybe. Although often people aren't. But even if you are, you're probably not achieving it. You're not getting the results that you want. So why are we not learning from that? Why are we not moving forward getting new data, trying something new, actually treating it as a sort of iterative development discovery process?

(00:07:32):
So I think that stuckness is one thing. And I think the other thing I look for is interpersonal conflict, right? Because I think that one mode of not asking for what you want well is holding back and not really saying it out loud. I think another really common mode is coming with a lot of entitlement of, "You know what? You better do what I say. I'm your boss. You're my report. You better obey or agree," or whatever it is. And of course the danger of that is interpersonal conflict. Even if you are their boss, that's a really disrespectful way to come into the conversation and it's an obvious source for a lot of issues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):
Before we get into how to learn to do this better and more of why this is so important, is there an example from your career where you did this really badly or you didn't ask what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:08:19):
There's so many examples. I think we will eventually get into the story of how I was fired from Slack. But I think for me, the thing that always came up was just being attached to being right. And I think a lot of us get into this boat. We enter into a meeting and we're sure from the first moment, "I'm right and they're wrong." And I think that especially in product management, we're supposed to be the holders of this vision for what the product should be. And so it's easy to come in with a lot of conviction and not really a lot of openness to other ideas.

(00:08:51):
Often what I try to introduce people to, and I've learned all this stuff the hard way, believe me, is it's fundamentally disrespectful to go into a meeting already deciding that you're right and the other person is wrong because you can't know that for sure. There's always a new perspective, new data that could come in. And so you want that conversation to really be a back and forth. And if you're coming in with this really ingrained sense of righteousness, you can't do that. There's no way to have that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):
I think you may have already answered this question, but I think it's really important is how do you know that this is something you need to be working on? How do you know like, "I really need to pay attention to what Kenneth is about to tell me?" You said one is you feel you're stuck in your career, something you're just not making progress, and this could be the answer. Or you said there's interpersonal conflict and you're just having a lot of conflict with people. Are those the two answers? Are there more?

Kenneth Berger (00:09:37):
I think those are great things to look for. I think it's also good to look for a sense of things being high stakes, because I think part of what can create a lot of conflict and difficulty in these situations is a sense of this is life or death. And that was certainly how it was when I was a founder of, "Okay, normally..." When I was at Adobe, it's a big company, they're going to be fine either way, no matter what I do. Right? I can be easy going. Let someone else have their way in the meeting. But when it was my company, when it was my vision on the line, I didn't feel especially flexible. The stakes seemed really, really high.

(00:10:12):
This is the success of my idea, of my vision, my reputation is on the line. And so I think often when the stakes feel high, we're kind of focused more on the fear of what we don't want to happen than on actually achieving what we do want. And that's a really critical distinction because if we're running away from our fears, it doesn't necessarily mean we're getting anywhere meaningful for what our desires are. And so that sense of high stakes that often we can get, whether it's in interpersonal conflict or being afraid of asking for what we want, that can get us really focused on the fears rather than focused on the goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
There's a question I was going to save for later, but it's something that's very top of mind for me is knowing what you want. How do you know what you want? There's basically knowing what you want and then asking for what you want. I like equanimity in my life, and so I often don't ask for what I want or push down maybe what I want, or I don't think about what I want. I just want other people to be happy.

(00:11:15):
I'm curious what people can do and what I can do to get better at knowing here's what actually want, here's what would make me happy and fulfilled? What are some skills there I could work on and other people can work on?

Kenneth Berger (00:11:27):
Well, first of all, I'd say you're very far from alone there. I mean, I think the people pleaser coping strategy is one of the sort of most classic, and it is effective, right? In the short term like, "Oh, you can feel safe and calm when other people are generally happy with you." And the cost tends to be long term in terms of am I really pursuing the things that are important to me?

(00:11:48):
So one of my favorite techniques here is this concept they call dream behind the complaint. Because you're right that we tend to not be that great always at really dreaming and envisioning and saying, "This is my dream of what I want out of life." That can sound really scary for people, but we're very good at complaining. Usually people are very good at saying, "Oh my God, there's this thing happening at work, it's so annoying. Or there's this person that really bothers me so much, why are they always like this?"

(00:12:17):
So the magic of that complaining is that every complaint implies a dream. It implies a better world where that complaint is resolved. And so often that's the tool that I'll take people to first to say, "All right, great. Let's complain. Right? It feels so fun and good and releasing to complain, and let's look at what that implied world is behind that complaint." What is this vision? And then to really check, "Okay. Let's imagine you get that. That's the world of the future that you get. How does that feel? Is that big enough or is it kind of meh?"

(00:12:50):
Are we like, "Oh, my dream is that I get to speak up a little more in meetings?" It's like, "Well, that's probably not a hundred percent of your dream. What's really behind that?" And so I think that check can help you sort of level up to say, "Is this really an inspiring dream for me that's going to motivate me more than those fears that might be hiding in the background?"

(00:13:13):
And on the flip side, with entitled people, you can also get really unrealistic dreams where I might say, "Okay. So it sounds like what I'm hearing is that your dream is that everyone obeys you and automatically agrees with you no matter what." And they sort of say, "Ah, I don't know if that's quite my dream." And so if your dream is so embarrassing to say out loud, you can't even really own it, maybe that's not the right dream. And so that checking whether it actually feels inspiring, but also sort of credible and possible is a good way to find that middle ground where, "Yeah, this dream is hard. I don't know that I'm going to get it, but, damn, it's worth trying. I want to go for it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):
I love that for someone that wants to try this on their own and help themselves get better at this without you being there, what is it that you do? Is it you dream about what would make you happiest? Is it complain and see what's at the root of it? Is it just imagine a world where you're really happy and see what emerges.

Kenneth Berger (00:14:11):
Specifically for articulating what you want because that's the first step of the asking for what you want process. It really is as simple as that of let's start with what you have consciously in terms of what you want. And if you have trouble, then we can try looking at complaints and starting to articulate a vision out of that.

(00:14:29):
But to me, really what's interesting about asking for what you want is that on the surface it's very simple, right? I mean, the steps I outline are articulate what you want, ask for what you want intentionally and accept the response and then try again. Because it's an iterative process. We're learning from the response and what it tells us because the response is usually no. So really what tends to be hard there, I mean, that's a straightforward process. It's not rocket science. What's hard there is the resistance.

(00:14:58):
The parts of us that are not so excited about that, that thinks asking for what we want is scary and articulating a big dream that we might not get is really scary. Because god, what if I don't get it? What does that mean about me? Am I a failure? Or what does it mean if I respect the no? What if I ask for my big dream and someone tells me I'm not going to get it? What does that mean? How am I going to feel?

(00:15:19):
So working through all that resistance is really a lot of what tends to be tricky about asking for what you want because otherwise it's articulate, ask, accept.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:28):
Okay. You're getting into where we're going to go. Before we get there. Final question. This idea of dealing with, no, I think this is the other big blocker for people is like, "Oh, that's so scary to ask for something I really want or ask for something big that is really important to you." What is it that you advise there of just getting over this fear of just asking for what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:15:49):
So I have a more expansive definition of no than most people, I think, because for me it's not a yes unless it's a hell yes. Because you really want enthusiastic consent. Not just, "Maybe, kinda. I'll try. We'll see. But yeah, absolutely, let's do this." And I think that often it's so tempting to settle for something less than that to say, "Oh, well, okay, we'll give that a try." And that often comes to bite us later on because we accept this thing that short of a hell yes. And then we realized later on, "Oh yeah, they weren't really in."

(00:16:26):
They didn't show up to the party or they didn't deliver on time because my CTO said, "Yeah, I think maybe we can deliver by May 1st." And then May 1st comes and surprise, surprise, your milestone is not done because you didn't go for that hell yes. And so I think part of what I encourage people to do is, one, to really hear anything short of a hell yes as a no. So it's not a bad thing. Mostly the world tells us it's actually really great data. It helps us figure out what are we going to try next? What are we going to try next, try next, try next? Because that's going to help us learn how to actually get to that hell yes.

(00:17:03):
And part of that asking process is of not settling for it, but actually asking and saying, "Hey, I'm hearing maybe you're lukewarm on May 1st as a date. What would be a hell yes day for you where you could say, absolutely, we can deliver on that?" And that way we're not making them wrong for saying no. We're saying, "Of course you get to say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want. But let's get to a hell yes. What would it take for us to get there?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
That's a really helpful framework and phrase to use is just what would it take to get to hell yes? Not just what would it take to get to you feeling comfortable with this? What would it take for you to just agree to this? It's more a hell yes. And your point there is hell yes is when they actually fully agree. Oftentimes people kind of like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah." And then they don't actually follow through.

Kenneth Berger (00:17:49):
Some people call this a whole body yes because sometimes your head is saying yes, but your heart is saying no or your gut is saying no. And so I think you can really feel in your body when you've got a hell yes, when all of you is fully in and ready to do this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
And this applies to, you're giving examples here of just getting like aligning a deadline. I imagine the same skill applies to everything in relationship questions and friends and family and work.

Kenneth Berger (00:18:19):
It does. And it is something universal, but I do think of it as being particularly relevant to my work with startups because I work primarily with startup founders. Because with startups you know that mostly they fail. We all know the numbers on that. And so to me, there's a perspective you have to take if you're going to operate in the startup world of being okay with not knowing that you're going to get the outcome you want. A lot of people, we operate in a safer world where we're more clear exactly what the outcomes are going to be, but if you're a startup founder, you've got to be okay with, "I'm just going to go for this, and I know I probably won't get it. But it's so meaningful to me, I'm going to go for it anyway."

(00:19:00):
And so to me, that's not just about the big picture of running a startup, it's about really anything you might want in life, because that's such a useful perspective to say, "I know I'm not going to get it. I know I'm not guaranteed to get it. I'm not going to be attached to that. I know people aren't obligated to tell me yes, but I'm going to go forward anyway because I want it and that's enough."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):
So let's actually get into the skill of learning how to actually ask for what you want more effectively. You already described three steps, so maybe just describe them again and let's just walk through them.

Kenneth Berger (00:19:32):
The first step is articulating what you want. And we've gone into this a little bit, but to me, I think that the key places that people tend to have missteps here, or one in this phrase, it's fine. I think of the "it's fine" cartoon with the flames and the dog, I think it is. But I think a lot of us fall into that trap of saying, "You know what? I'm fine. I actually, I don't need anything. I'm good."

(00:19:59):
And again, this is tempting, right? Because it's so nice to have this idea that I'm fine, I don't need anything. And in a certain way, that's a nice attitude because yeah, we're not guaranteed anything, so it's nice to be okay with the status quo. But for those folks, often what I'm encouraging that do is to really tune into the parts of them that maybe aren't so fine like, "Gosh, I'd prefer it a little bit if things were this way or yeah, I'm a little bit bothered by this, or I'm a little bit nervous about this."

(00:20:26):
And so kind of tuning more into those subtle emotions that are pointing them towards, "Sure, I'm okay with the status quo, but I want something more." And so helping them articulate that in a clearer way where they can want something without being attached to having to get it. The other extreme of this is people who articulate these sort of wildly unrealistic goals. So this is the founder that just wants everyone to agree with him all the time and to obey him immediately.

(00:20:56):
So for those folks, it really tends to be more about saying it out loud. Once you say it out loud, it is clearer. That's not really what it's about. And so for those folks, I tend to ask them to go deeper to say, "Yeah, I know you're not a control freak. You don't want everyone to think exactly what you think. What's it really about? What does that get you?" And so often it goes from being this more kind of objective external goal to being a more kind of social emotional goal of, "You know what, I just want to have a team that feels really aligned around me and we're just ready to go for it and we've got each other's backs."

(00:21:35):
That doesn't mean we agree with each other all the time or that we're a hundred percent aligned in everything, but it doesn't mean there's a certain feeling that I have when I go into work. Even though I don't know that we're going to get what we want or that everyone is going to agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):
Do you have any examples from your time you could share of someone articulating what they want and figuring out how they articulate, how to articulate what they want just to make it even more real?

Kenneth Berger (00:21:58):
To me a lot of the classic examples are around feedback. Because I work with a lot of founders who are not the sort of classic control freaks. They're super nice and their teams love them and they love their teams. So for them, it can be really hard to deliver hard feedback, to deliver negative feedback and even more to actually create consequences. Because the thing about accepting other people's no is that, "Sure, they can always say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want, but there are consequences." And so the classic thing I see with the nice founders is they're really afraid to actually create consequences when people are not living up to their expectations. Right?

(00:22:40):
When they're not aligned with the culture, they're not delivering in the way that the CEO wants them to be delivering because it doesn't seem that nice. They're like, "Oh, I think of myself as nice and of being so kind and of people loving me." And it's like, "Well, that doesn't mean that there aren't consequences for their actions."

(00:22:56):
Part of really respecting them is respecting that they can make the choices they want and they're grownups enough that they can deal with the consequences of those choices."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):
Can you even get more concrete there? Is it we need to hit this date, or are there going to be big problems? Or is it like, "I need you to hire this large of a team?" I don't know. What is it that they're not articulating that they later realize, "Oh, here's what I need to articulate."

Kenneth Berger (00:23:20):
So I think sometimes it is about alignment, the disagree and commit. So I see that a lot of founders saying, "Hey, I'm super respectful of your differing opinion here, and I totally validate you and I appreciate you. Thank you so much for sharing that." But they're not willing to go that extra step and say, "Yeah, but this is the call and I need you to actually follow through with that. I understand that might be disappointing or frustrating or what have you, but part of the expectation for this role is that you can roll with disagree and commit sometimes when that's necessary."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:52):
That's an awesome example. I fully get that and I could see how scary that is to a lot of people. One is just coming to terms with, "This is what I actually want to be doing, but I just don't feel like I can because it's going to, I think, upset people." Okay. So what else can you suggest people do to help identify what it is they want and articulate what they want? So you talked about pay attention to just like, "Oh, this would be better. If this changed, I'd be happier." Or things would probably run better. That's a really cool example of how to think do that because easy, just like, "Oh yeah, if we actually can make a decision in this meeting, that'd be really cool." Maybe we should try to do that and ask for that. Is there any other tips and approaches to helping you figure out what you want?

Kenneth Berger (00:24:40):
It always comes back to integrity. And a great way to do an integrity check is to just look have I fully expressed myself? And so I think we've talked a little bit about charting your feelings as a piece of that of like, "Yeah, am I really tuning into how annoyed I am or how frustrated I am or how nervous I am?" Because if I haven't fully owned those feelings and expressed those in whatever way is appropriate, then probably I'm not fully in integrity.

(00:25:09):
I think saying what you have to say is a piece of that too. "Gosh, is there something that I keep thinking about and I'm just like three or four days, I'm just like, man, I really want to say this to this person." At this point, you're probably out of integrity because there's something deep in you that really needs to say this, right? And so to me, articulating what you want is really about mindfulness is about checking for all these things.

(00:25:35):
What is the part of me that's not fully expressed? Because it doesn't mean I'm going to get what I want or that people are going to give me all my dreams immediately, but it feels so much better to have it out. That sort of suffering that fear usually comes from holding it in and saying, "Oh, having these stories of I'm not allowed to say that. It's not appropriate to express that I'm bored in this meeting." Versus saying, "Probably a lot of people would be grateful if we said out loud, 'I'm bored in this meeting.' Let's move things along."

(00:26:56):
Okay. This is a great segue too. Now I have a sense. I need to change this. This needs to change. I'm just scared to say this, to bring it up, to change the way people are operating to ask for what I want. What advice can you share for people to actually do this?

Kenneth Berger (00:27:12):
So for asking what you want, I think the really important tweak here is asking intentionally because I think a lot of us are stuck on a certain track that's comfortable for us when we ask. And so if you're more in the people-pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind and just magically knowing what you want.

(00:27:34):
And if you're more in the control-free camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, "Go do this now." And so for both of those folks, it's not about... I think if you ask any of them, "Is this working for you?" They'd say no. Of course, it's obvious from an effectiveness standpoint, it's not working well, but they more just haven't embraced that you can do it a different way that they only really see one way of doing it.

(00:28:00):
So part of asking for what you want effectively is really just recognizing the rut that you get stuck in and working through all those narratives that make us resist asking it a different way. Because often the people who don't want to ask have a story that says, "This is too risky. Or it's not worth it. They're going to say no anyway, so why even bother?"

(00:28:24):
So these are all very common things that people go through, but then they end up not actually asking for what they want. Now, actually expressing who they are and what they stand for in the world. And that has a really serious cost. I think that we tend to tell ourselves the story, "Oh, this is fine. I'll be fine." Versus owning, "I'm going to be living my life not asking for what I want." Do I really want to be at my funeral and have people say, "Oh, Kenneth played it safe. He didn't really go for his dreams, but he was nice. No one was ever mad at him." That's not what we want people to say at our eulogies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):
No. That's good motivation. Okay. So say in this example you gave of like, "I need us to make a decision. I know I'm trying to keep everyone happy, but we need to make a decision." Do you have advice for maybe phrases of how to approach. You talked about making intentional. How do you actually go about doing that? Is it the way you communicate it? Is it something else? How do you actually do this without pissing people off and also just risking too much?

Kenneth Berger (00:29:33):
Even implicit in that question, to me that's that question of, "Oh, how do I do it without being any risk of ever pissing anyone off?" That's a piece of the resistance right there. And so this is a great example of the type of work that we have to do, right? Because in theory, asking is easy, "Oh, you just try some way and maybe people are pissed off and maybe they're not." But probably it's going to be fine and you'll have the chance to try again and iterate and work from it.

(00:30:00):
But often we get stuck so we don't get to go through those levels of iteration because we want to make sure we're going to get the outcome. We say, "Oh, well, I'm not willing to ever piss anyone off ever. And so I'm just going to be stuck at this step because I haven't figured out what's going to guarantee me." And of course, there's no guarantee. We can never guarantee that people are going to feel a particular way.

(00:30:22):
So part of asking for what you want effectively is actually bringing some compassion for yourself. Of course, we all want to be sure that the way we ask is going to be effective and no one is going to be mad at us and we're going to get all of our dreams come true. But we don't get that. I wish we did. That would be nice. But is that worth not pursuing your dreams in life?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Such a good point about what you identified and the way... I think a lot of people that think about it, it's just like, "I'd always do this without causing anyone any pain or risking anything going wrong." I think that's, to your point, part of it. So you talk a lot about founders. You work with a lot of founders, a lot of listeners here are not founders, they're product managers, ICs on teams, other functions that don't have "power". Is there anything that you suggest these folks do differently or think about this differently or is it kind of the same thing? In the end everyone has power in some way. How would you think about this if you're just, say, a product manager, individual contributor?

Kenneth Berger (00:31:23):
I think one of the most important balances in terms of the asking step is both asking clearly, but asking with great humility. And this actually works whether you're in a position of power or not because I think a lot of folks will go so far to the end of humility. They say, "Well, I'm not going to say this out loud at all." But in fact, if you're willing to say, I really disagree with this product decision and I would really prefer that we make this different decision. I know it's not my call and I'm just one opinion and a lot of people are going to see things differently and that's fine, but it's important to me that you know that. So what do you think? Are you willing to reconsider this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:00):
That's such a great approach. It's very not scary to say that. It also, I think, highlights something I wanted to touch on is I think people have a lot more influence and power than they think they do. Say a PM on a team disagrees with a plan for a product. People actually care about your opinion and you could actually change things. But just telling them, "I think this is a bad idea." And you often don't. Is that what you find, that people have a lot more influence than they think they do? Anything along those lines that comes up?

Kenneth Berger (00:32:35):
You're giving me deep goosebumps because I think this is a really underappreciated thing in terms of asking for what we want because especially in the PM world, we're trained to look for data. We're not just going to state an opinion. We're going to say, "Oh, the AB test said this. Or 30% of our users do this, or the ROI on this is X." And data is great. We love data for a reason of course. And I think people forget about exactly what you're highlighting, that your relationships matter, and that just your opinion because you believe something or because you want something often that's enough.

(00:33:13):
Because guess what? You're in a relationship with these people you work with. They care about you. You have some sort of leverage with them. And I think that often people go the other way and say, "Oh, I've got power. I'm going to try and leverage it." But actually, if you go the other direction and you're humble and you say, "I know I can't make you do anything, it's not my call to make. But man, this is really what I want. I'm just going to put it out there and ask." That I think it feels really vulnerable and uncomfortable to not lean on data as a sort of way of saying, "No, no, I'm right, so you should believe what I believe." But just say, "Actually, I don't know that I'm right. This is just what I think and I hope that's enough on its own."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):
Do you find that that's actually a crutch a lot of times to people not saying anything is they don't have that data? They don't have evidence and they just, "I shouldn't say anything. If someone asks for why I don't have a great answer, I just think this is what should be."

Kenneth Berger (00:34:03):
Totally. And I think there's a balance there as with anything. Is ignoring data and going in gut all the time, great? Probably not, right? We use data for a reason, but I think there are all these moments when we are making a gut decision and having all the data there means having the opinion set out loud. I think often the dangers of people saying, "Oh, I don't have data to back this up. It's just what I think. And I'm not sure people are going to agree with me, so I'm just not going to say it."

(00:34:35):
So we don't have the data of all those gut opinions of these subject matter experts in the room, even though that gut information to me is just as important as anything we could get from the SQL database or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:48):
Before we move on to step three, you talked about the opposite of asking for what you want. This was just step two is just complaining and being angry later like, "I knew this project was going to fail. I knew this was a terrible deadline. I knew this design was not great." Anything more you want to say along those lines of just like, "If you're not asking for what you want, complaining is often a sign that you should be doing that more"?

Kenneth Berger (00:35:11):
To me, complaints are great inspiration. To me, I love radical candor, for example, where I try to go a step further than radical candor is to not just say, "Hey, here's my feedback. Just wanted you to know." But to say, "And I want something. I would like to see an outcome." And so I think that to me it's all about the effective framing that the complaint is probably not going to be an effective way to do it, but it can be great inspiration to say, "Gosh, that complaining means I'm frustrated. What am I frustrated about? Let me envision that better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. What's an effective way to communicate that desire that's actually likely to get me towards a yes?"

(00:35:58):
And so when we actually embrace that sort of frustration, annoying, complaining thing and follow that thread down and think about how to be effective that way, we can actually get something really compelling and useful, but it requires actually embracing that part of ourselves that sometimes we're a little bit ashamed of like, "Oh, I don't like that whiny part of myself. I'm just going to push that one down versus actually taking what it has to say as important data."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:24):
That's a really good point. I think that's actually another blocker for a lot of people is just, "I don't want to be a complaining person. I just want to be like, let's do this. I'm in, let's go. I don't want to be seen as a squeaky wheel." Is there anything you say there about as a resistance point for people?

Kenneth Berger (00:36:40):
Well, I'm a big fan of internal family systems, which is this sort of psychotherapy technique that really talks about parts and the sort of parts of ourselves and the ways in which they don't always agree with each other. Part of why I love this approach is, A, because we already use this language. We say, "Part of me thinks this, a part of me thinks that." And really when I talk about how to work through resistance, really it's about embracing and validating all of our parts.

(00:37:07):
Because often we're really comfortable with one part of ourselves that we think is, "Oh, this part is virtuous and good and great, and this part is whiny and bad, and not great, and I don't respect that part of me as much." So really to sort of ask effectively, we generally need to embrace all these parts and really bring in all the information they're bringing in because if we ignore the part that's really scared to ask, well, then we're going to stay stuck.

(00:37:32):
Versus if we come in and say, "Hey, buddy, why are you scared? You seem terrified. What's going on? Oh, well man, you think your whole professional reputation has staked on this and you're an imposter and they're going to find out, and then you'll never work again? Well, of course you'd be scared. That makes a ton of sense." And by embracing that, instead of ignoring that and being ashamed of that, that is often how we soften those fears and say, "I know that's scary, but we also know that's not really true. You're not an imposter, right? You're an experienced professional."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:01):
Man, there's so many threads we can't follow here. This whole line of internal family systems, right?

Kenneth Berger (00:38:06):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:07):
That's its own podcast episode potentially. And then imposter syndrome, we've touched a bunch of different podcast episodes, but I'll avoid going in that direction. Something you reminded me of is we just had Carole Robin on the podcast who taught this class touchy-feely at Stanford for a long time, which is all about helping people learn how to deal with other people, which we never learned in life. It's like a class, how to learn to work with other people.

Kenneth Berger (00:38:29):
I took one of Stanford's T-Group Weekends, summer of 2020, I think a month after George Floyd was murdered and was facilitated by a black woman. And it was one of the most profound transformative weekends of my life. Because T-groups already people rave about them. But having it at that point in history with those people in the room, oof.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):
A lot of tears, I imagine.

Kenneth Berger (00:38:54):
It was crazy. I mean, it was really wild.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):
I feel like every single person that has gone through, I think it's called Leaders in Tech is the broader umbrella term. And Carole talked about it. Everyone that has gone through it, 100% have told me that it's a transformative life experience for them. And you had a bonus transformational piece. So anyway, if people want to check out that episode, I will include it in the show notes. But the reason I brought it up is Carole shared this framework for how to actually give feedback in a way where people can receive it that I'll just highlight here. I have it here.

(00:39:26):
And it's somewhat related to nonviolent communication, which is what you touched on. And she told me, actually, she taught this way before nonviolent communication came out with their whole philosophy. And it's basically when you want to give someone feedback, the template is when you do a behavior, I feel a feeling, and she's big on like say actual feeling word not like, "I feel like, or I feel that," blah, blah, blah. And step three is, "I'm telling you this because..." and then what you want them to change. Do you find that sort of approach helpful?

Kenneth Berger (00:40:01):
I do. I teach the same thing. I think sort of Carole's approach and nonviolent communication, DBT teaches a similar approach. They call dear man.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:12):
To me, what's DBT?

Kenneth Berger (00:40:14):
It's a dialectical behavioral therapy. It's related to CBT. So there's kind of rough consensus in the sort of personal development world of how to ask. And really what they have in common is around staying really factual because I think that what can we know factually well? We can know our thoughts, we can know our feelings because no one else can know that better than us. Maybe we can trust our eyes. What would a video camera have recorded? And that's about it.

(00:40:44):
So I think often we get really distracted by all these stories we have about the data, but when we bring it back to that fundamental core of this is what I think, this is what I feel, this is what I've observed in the world, it tends to make the ask a lot clearer versus these stories like you mentioned of, "I feel like you're an asshole." It's like, "Well, that's a story. That's not a fact."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):
Yeah. I feel that is not the right way to say I feel. What do you actually feel? No. Okay, so let's move to step three. We've been going on this whole tangent of therapy and stuff, which is amazing, but let's make sure we cover all three steps. So step one again was articulate what you want. Step two is ask for what you want. What's step three?

Kenneth Berger (00:41:28):
So to me step three is actually the trickiest for most people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:32):
So far, they're all tricky to me.

Kenneth Berger (00:41:34):
Oh yeah, they're all tricky, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:36):
The most tricky.

Kenneth Berger (00:41:38):
But step three is accept the response. And it might seem so simple, but it actually is kind of subtle. And so one reason is that idea of sort of the whole body yes or the hell yes. Because I think often we really want a yes. And so we're very, very biased to look for a yes versus accepting no, "That was a no." If someone made this face, that's a no. It doesn't matter what comes out of their mouth. And so the challenge of accepting the response is often that of hearing the no, but not over accepting or under accepting it.

(00:42:18):
Because I think sometimes what people who are really afraid to ask will do is they say, oh, well, that was a no. So it's no forever and I should never ask again. My dream is dead and nothing is ever going to happen for me again." And that's because they get so scared. But actually no, that's over accepting. The no is just from this person right now in the way that you asked, which doesn't necessarily mean anything about the next time you ask to a different person in a different way, in a different time.

(00:42:44):
And on the flip side, in that sort of more control freak mode, I think for them they'll often skip over the response say, "Well, they said no, but they don't know what they're talking about." Or they're my direct report, so they have to do what I say. So these are all fundamentally disrespectful ways to operate in this relationship. When we're talking about asking for what we want, we're talking about influence. So you need to have good relationships. You can't be influential with a bad relationship.

(00:43:13):
So really accepting the response is about, yes, I'm going to be genuine about what I want, but I'm also going to genuinely care about you and have deep respect for your ability to consent or not consent to whatever the ask is. Because I think the counterintuitive thing is that often when we really respect people's no's, it can actually be more influential, more motivating. If someone says, "Okay. I'm not ready to deliver this on time." Be like, "Okay. Well, I'm going to give the project to another person."

(00:43:46):
I'm taking your no at face value. And they say, "Oh gosh, well, I didn't realize that was going to be the consequence. Maybe I can get it done by that time." And so that way you're not forcing them and you're not coercing them, right? You're just saying, "No, you said no? So that your no is no, and I accept that."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):
So it feels like part of the skill here is preparing, is knowing. Some people just say no and that's okay. That's part of the experience. Part of it is if there's this not yet component... We had Mihika Kapoor on the podcast. She has a PM at Figma and she had this really great approach to building new things within companies is just like everything to her is not yet and no is a not yet. And the way you phrased it is it could just be the way you asked. It could be, maybe they'll agree if you can figure out a better way to pitch the thing. Is there anything more you can add there about just this idea of it's not no forever?

Kenneth Berger (00:44:36):
Acceptance of the response is primarily an emotional regulation issue because once we get our emotions intact, it's just, is it yes or is it no? And if it's no, which it probably is, most of the time the world tells us no, then the question is, "All right, what can I learn from this? What am I going to try next?" And so when we're able to emotionally regulate, it's all very cut and dry, right? It's like, "Okay. Here's data to tell me what to try next."

(00:45:02):
And so really, 99% of the challenge tends to be all the feelings that come up for us when we hear no. Because We hate hearing no. It's so uncomfortable. And so part of the practice of getting good at asking for what we want is recognizing you're going to hear no all the time, and that's completely normal and fine, and it doesn't need to be something so scary or awful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):
Easier said than done in real life. Is there an example of either a client of yours... I know you can't actually share specific details, but I'm just curious if there's an example that comes up of someone dealing with this and getting better at it, or your own career.

Kenneth Berger (00:45:38):
I gave a talk about this sort of right after it happened, but I was fired from Slack three different times, which I feel like has to be some kind of startup record. I don't know who would be the record-keeping body for this. But now 10 years on, I have different perspective, of course. And so this was almost exactly 10 years ago, spring of 2014 and I just gotten the job as the first PM at Slack. It was already the hottest thing out there. It was only a couple dozen employees.

(00:46:03):
I came in excited, but also a little insecure because I had just come off my breakup with my co-founder. I just wanted to put my head down and do a good job. I was engaged at the time, so Slack already knew I was going to be going away on a bachelor or backpacking trip. I have a wedding and honeymoon in the fall. And so I came in naive and overconfident of, "I've been a founder. I've worked on iconic products. I know how to do this. I'm a pro. I'm just going to go in and do the work."

(00:46:32):
So instead of getting really clear on what does success look like here or what's your culture or what are your expectations of me, I just went in and made my best guess and went for it. And lo and behold, turns out what I came in with, that supreme overconfidence was not what they wanted at all. They'd kind of been in the trenches reinventing from the game to Slack. They'd been through layoffs, really hard times together. So they wanted someone to come in humble and to earn their trust of this kind of core team that had been together for years.

(00:47:07):
I just didn't get any of that. I wasn't hearing that feedback. I wasn't hearing those nos, and I wasn't articulating what I wanted. What I wanted was really very basic. I just wanted to figure out how to do a good job, and I wanted to have a good relationship with the CEO because I was working for him. And you need to have a good relationship with your boss. But the problem was in the first firing anyway was I had not articulated those goals.

(00:47:36):
And so I shouldn't have been surprised when six weeks into my tenure at Slack, I came back from my backpacking trip with my bachelor buddies, and I had an email in my inbox saying, "Hey, you're fired. It seems like it's not working out. Let me know how you want to wrap it up." So as you can imagine, I freaked out. I loved this job, I love this company, so I profusely apologized. I said, "I'll do whatever it takes. I'm so sorry. I'm going to be committed to turn this around."

(00:48:07):
And so early stage startup turns out firing doesn't always stick. Monday morning, I had my job back. But obviously things were not the same as they'd been before because in the second era, what I wanted was sort of better articulated more clear, but all of a sudden that fear that had been under the surface, that insecurity was now very, very present every day because I was terrified of was I going to get fired? Was I going to not make the most of this opportunity? And so I went fully into people pleaser mode. And so that meant that even though what I desperately wanted was to have this good relationship was to be successful, build a great product. I had a year of one-on-ones with the CEO.

(00:48:52):
I never, never ever asked for what I wanted. I never said it out loud because I was scared. I was scared of what the consequences were. I knew there were a hundred PMs standing behind me ready to take my job if the CEO is ever a moment unhappy with me. I said, "No, I'm not going to take the risk. I'm too scared of what the consequences might be." And so I held all that fear and all those desires of, "I just want to do a great job. I want us to be awesome partners and build this amazing industry changing product."

(00:49:22):
I never said any of that stuff out loud. I just put my head down and I tried to obey. And so as you can imagine, this didn't work very well. I was feeling horrible day to day. I was terrified of this guy I was working for. And so again, I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was, when I got fired for the second time. It wasn't quite firing. But this time I'd come back from my honeymoon and I had a phone call on Monday that said, "Seems like product management is not working out for Slack. We're actually just going to get rid of product. You're going to be user research. It's going to be fine."

(00:49:56):
And for me, I love user research, but that was the beginning of my career. I was not interested in going back to that. What was fascinating was at that point, I was actually able to articulate what I wanted there and was willing to say it out loud. Because what I wanted was, "No, let's keep me in product. I've got an idea for how we can run it." So I wrote a proposal, I sent it around to the management team. Turns out, when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.

(00:50:21):
And so within a week, this new plan had traction with the management team team and I had my old job back again. Everything was fine except of course it wasn't fine because now I was scared, but the stakes seemed really high, and this is where that deep imposter syndrome sit in. I was like, "Am I even any good at this? Should I even be in product management? Am I ever going to work in this industry again? Is this going to be my dark secret that I take to the grave that Stewart Butterfield fired me three times?"

(00:50:58):
I think what I couldn't be with in that moment was the no's, because I was getting no after no after no after no from Stewart and the rest of the management team saying, "What you're doing is not working for us, right? Your ask are not landing. You're not being effective in the way that you want to be effective." And because I wasn't able to hear those no's again, because to that emotional regulation standpoint, I couldn't handle the feelings of like, "Ugh, maybe what I'm doing is not good enough."

(00:51:26):
So instead of pointing the finger at myself, I pointed the finger at him. I said, "You know what? Actually this guy, he's not such a great manager. He's not so good at product. I'm the one who was on the ground with the users. I know what's right." Against all evidence to the contrary, by the way, is this product luminary, visionary, famous person.

(00:51:45):
So clearly not based on any facts, but it was an emotional issue of I couldn't deal with the reality of what I was doing was not working. And so again, because I was not articulating what I wanted, I was not asking for it and I certainly was not listening to the no's. I shouldn't have been surprised when finally the third time it came down, and this time it was serious because we had HR.

(00:52:09):
So it turns out once you hire HR, the firings are final. And so I only made it to a year at Slack and it was a year of just utter torture because I spent that year being fully out of integrity with myself. Never saying what I really wanted, how I really felt because it didn't feel safe. I was too scared. I kept it all inside. And it took me six months or a year even after that to really feel safe and okay again. It was a serious decompression time.

(00:52:39):
My wife and I had a baby during that time. I was on zero sleep. It was a rough, rough period. But the irony is that when I actually came out of that experience, the reality of it was extremely simple. I hadn't articulated what I wanted. I hadn't asked for what I wanted. I had not listened to the no's in response to my non-ask.

(00:53:02):
And so of course I was unhappy with the result. Why would I have expected anything different? I wasn't the victim. Stewart wasn't the villain. It was just ineffective asking. And so to me, especially because I was already on that path towards coaching, that lesson hit really hard in terms of how do we make this work more sustainable?

(00:53:24):
We stay in integrity with ourselves even when it's hard, even when it's scary, even when we don't know exactly what the outcome is going to be. And so that's really the story of how I became a coach, of seeing exactly how much I'd screwed up at Slack and seeing how much I had suffered and how much a lot of people suffer in these similar circumstances. All you have to do to turn it around is ask for what you want.

(00:53:45):
So this is why I'm so passionate about this stuff because it can sound so fluffy to say, "Oh, focus on integrity. Honor your desires. No, it's real life stuff of a year of suffering, of pain, of fear." I don't want other people to be going through that and that's why I'm so passionate about this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):
Wow, what a story. I love that it's kind of a microcosm of everything we've talked about. You've did all the things that you teach people to avoid.

Kenneth Berger (00:54:18):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:18):
And I think what's interesting is you went through these three phases. Interestingly, at the beginning, your first phase was you were not hearing the no's, but it was rooted in this confidence that you're a founder, you're awesome. They're so lucky to have you. I know what I'm doing, get out of my way. And then the third phase, you also, the issue there was you weren't hearing the no's, but it was more from fear of being fired again. And so it's interesting that there's these different reasons you're not hearing what people are actually saying.

Kenneth Berger (00:54:46):
Totally. Well, and to me, the first one is about articulation as well because I think that if in the beginning it articulated that, "Yeah, I'm confident, but actually I want to do a really good job and I want to have good relationships. So let me think about intentionally, how do I create those outcomes?" But because I hadn't articulated that's what I wanted, it didn't even occur to me like, "Oh yeah, I need to do some intentional relationship building, figure out some metrics for success."

(00:55:11):
It was an early stage startup. There wasn't a ton of sort of process or structure in place, suffice to say. And so if I wanted that, I needed to create it myself, but because I hadn't articulated that any of that was important to me, I just flew by the seat of my pants and it took failing to get some data to say, "Ooh, yeah, maybe I need to look at this more closely."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
I imagine you've gone through this exercise many times, but say you were to do it again, what would you do differently and what do you think would've happened? Do you think you would've stayed there for many, many years, had a product at Slack at this point? Just imagining that reality, what would you have done differently? And then what would you have imagined have turned out?

Kenneth Berger (00:55:49):
Well, I mean obviously broadly, I would've asked for what I wanted and what I wanted was I wanted to do the best work of our life. I wanted to have a deep professional partner in the CEO and the rest of the product and management team. And I wanted to produce great work that people loved. And that was part of why I was attracted to the culture and the mission and the company. And so this is what's tricky is of course, that's what I would've done. Now, do I know what the outcome would've been?

(00:56:16):
No, I might've been fired even sooner. They might've said, "No, this is not working out. Let's just be done here." So that's what's tricky about this is it really isn't about the outcome. Of course, asking for what you want makes you more likely to get the outcome you want, but you don't do it for guarantee of a certain outcome because no one can promise you that. You do it so you can stay in integrity with yourself and not suffer through all this. Because at least then I would've said, "You know what? It didn't work out. At least I'm not sitting here suffering. I can get another job at another startup. It's not the end of the world."

(00:56:51):
And I think that the mistake we make is pretending that it is of saying, going into fight or flight and saying, "This is a severe existential threat to who I am and my safety in the world," versus being like, "I'm disappointed. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
That's a really profound point that this practice isn't necessarily to just have everything work out beautifully and to get the things you're looking for. It's to feel like you did, which you could have and to feel integrity with yourself that you did what you needed to do and you're not going to regret something down the road.

Kenneth Berger (00:57:29):
Indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):
I'm going to take a quick tangent down the being the first PM route real quick. There's a lot of people that think about being the first PM at a startup join as the first PM. I imagine you work with people asking for advice along these lines. It's classically a very challenging role. Many people don't last. Many people follow your trajectory where it's like, "Oh, shit. What have I done?" Any advice for people that are a first PM at a company or startup or thinking about that role?" What can you tell them to help them be successful or at least not suffer?

Kenneth Berger (00:58:05):
To me, it really is about the relationship with the CEO or with the founders because that's the root of a lot of the issues that come out of that scenario because it's not always you. In my story, I think it was primarily about me, but I also work with a lot of founders who are going through really tough things. My clue to people who report to a founder is to say, "Imagine if you're confused about how your founder is behaving. Imagine that they're terrified all the time, and see if that makes their behavior more clear."

(00:58:38):
Because it is scary to be a founder. Everything is on your shoulders. And I think a lot of people do feel that sense of high stakes all the time. And so I think being real about that of what is the state that the person or the people you're working for are in and sort of working within that versus sort of pretending that it's something else or wishing that it were something else is the path to having a healthy relationship. Because if you don't have a healthy relationship with the person you're working for, you're not going to get anything done. You're not going to succeed in any meaningful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):
I love that framework of how to think about why a founder is behaving in a certain way. Just maybe a last following thread there is just what should people look for to help them understand if the founder and them are a good fit, if they're going to have a good time working with that founder? Is there anything just like questions they might ask or ways of operating that are useful to understand like, "Okay, I think I'll be okay with this founder in this company as the first PM or not.

Kenneth Berger (00:59:34):
I think it's a hard thing to generalize about, but to me it really is about understanding expectations. I guess this is a predictable coming from me, "But what do you really want? Because I think that often the founders put together a job description, but then they're faced with a real human being who has real human subtleties and things they're good at or not so good at." And so being very, very clear about expectations and of figuring out collaboratively a way to work together that's effective to me is there's no guarantees of course, but it gives you a more sure path to having a productive relationship.

(01:00:13):
It's actually something that I recommend to a lot of founders for maybe their first 10 or 15, or 20 employees of just have a relationship design conversation with each of them when they're first hired. Because I think a lot of us come in naive the way I did, assuming, "Oh yeah, I'm just going to come in and do my thing the way I've always done it. It's going to be fine." Versus coming in and saying, "I actually don't know how I'm going to operate at this company. I have range like anyone has range, and I don't know what this company needs and who else is here and sort of what my role and what my place is going to be within these other people. And so by really understanding that intentionally and not from a place of performance management, you're already doing this poorly, you're in big trouble. But what is the best way to work together given who we have now and what we want and what we need? Let's figure it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):
Coming back to our core topic, is there anything that we didn't cover, anything that I should have asked you about the skill, the art of asking for what you want? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?

Kenneth Berger (01:01:12):
I do want to mention something that I hear a lot from founders when I talk about the piece of working through resistance because I think a lot of them say, "Oh, you want me to let go of fear and focus on what I want? Well, I mean, I've been running from fear my whole career. That's how I'm so hard-working and I'm so smart is I'm always afraid I'm not good enough."

(01:01:34):
Am I going to be able to do this job without fear hounding me every step of the way? I just remember the first time I heard this, it broke my heart, and now I've heard it dozens of times I'd say. So I mean, it really is. I think it's a belief that sits deep in the hearts of a lot of us high achieving Silicon Valley tech types of, "My fear of not being good enough is what drives me to be great."

(01:02:00):
And I just want to come out here and say there's other ways to motivate. You can motivate based on joy, based on vision, based on your inspiration in this vision of what you want. I think a lot of folks I talk to are skeptical understandably because operated a different way their whole life and all I can really say is try it. Try following an inspiring vision that's really meaningful to you and just see what it's like to not be living in fear all the time because it is a big difference and it's really meaningful. It matters a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
So is the fear there that if they ask for what they want, they'll get what they want and they let go of this drive to prove themselves? And is that the fear? How is it that they move away from that need to prove themselves?

Kenneth Berger (01:02:51):
Well, I mean that's a longer story. I would say managing our own fear as a sort of lifelong practice. I'm not going to claim I'm anywhere near done with it. But I guess I'd just say that I think part of the big shift I see in personal development for people I work with is from saying, "Oh, no, my fear is good. I need it. It's keeping me safe."

(01:03:16):
To saying, "Fear is for when there's a tiger chasing you and there's no tiger chasing me." I'm sitting in my office in a desk chair on a zoom call. There's no real danger here. And so fear is not particularly functional. And so when they start realizing that, the practice becomes, "Oh yeah, I'm feeling afraid." But I'm reminding myself there's not a tiger in the room. If I really want to get things done, achieve my goals, I need to focus on vision on what I want to achieve in the world, not on avoiding all these fears. So that's the short of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):
Amazing. It reminds me, we have a chat... I had a chat with Matt Mochari, and we spent a bunch of time on dealing with fear and overcoming fear. So folks want to dig deeper there. They could check out that episode. Just maybe one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, classic contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't.

Kenneth Berger (01:04:16):
For me, I'm not a big believer in discipline that I think some folks come to coaching looking for a drill sergeant and say, "All right. Shout at me and tell me to do better." And I start to say, "That's not how I operate." Because it's not the discipline doesn't work, but it's like people-pleasing. It's a short-term coping strategy. Discipline will get you in the gym for a week, but it's not going to get you in the gym for a year. The people who are in the gym for a year are doing it because they want to.

(01:04:49):
There's actually something that's motivating for them in that. It's not just, "Oh, I hate this, but I'm going to go anyway." And so I try to be really clear with people about that, that I'm not going to be the drill sergeant because it's unsustainable. Someone shouting at you is not going to get you moving towards what you want in life over multiple years. It's days or weeks or even hours thing. And so I really look for a higher bar to say, "Let's look for true long-term sustainable motivation," which means relying on vision, pursuing what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:25):
I love that it all ties back to knowing what you want, asking for what you want, and then dealing with the answers that you get.

Kenneth Berger (01:05:30):
I am a broken record admittedly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
Amazing. Kenneth, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kenneth Berger (01:05:40):
No, but just thank you for letting me share this stuff. It really is my life's work and I'm very passionate about it and I hope it's helpful for people. I'm going to be writing more about it on LinkedIn.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Okay, amazing. We'll point people there. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kenneth Berger (01:05:57):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:58):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kenneth Berger (01:06:03):
Well, I already mentioned Radical Candor. I think that is for sure a modern classic and I think that whole idea of challenging directly, but caring personally is very much aligned with what I'm talking about, right? Because you need the relationships and you need to actually speak your truth. So I love Kim Scott's writing on that stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):
We had a Kim Scott on the podcast. Folks want to dig deeper there. We'll link to that episode. I'll let you keep going. Sorry for the interruption.

Kenneth Berger (01:06:31):
Yeah. I mean I mentioned before, but I actually took Jonny Miller's Nervous System Mastery course. I just wrapped up. So you've had lots of great personal professional development thinkers on the podcast, so thank you for introducing me to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:47):
I'm so happy to hear that. We'll link to that episode as well. I love that. What a circle of life we've got here, guests following other guests, taking their courses, joining the podcast. What a happy world.

Kenneth Berger (01:06:58):
Yeah, indeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):
Okay. Any other books before we move on?

Kenneth Berger (01:07:02):
I also love the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, so I'm pretty sure other guests have mentioned that as well. But to me, part of why I like that is that I think a lot of personal development books are not very directive. They say, "Oh, just dig deeply and find your truth." And while there is value to that, of course, I think sometimes it's nice to have some direction of, "Here's 15 things that generally your life's going to be better if you do them." And so to me, it's a nice balance of embracing the really deep stuff of how to live a good life and be effective in the world and be really directive. Try this stuff. It works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Kenneth Berger (01:07:43):
I'm a recent tennis fanatic, so it was one of the things I picked up during the pandemic, so I really enjoyed Netflix's Breakpoint because it's a documentary on the best tennis players in the world. I just find it so... I don't know. It is just beautiful seeing how everyone is the same because all these people, they all know all the strokes perfectly. They're technically perfect in pretty much every way. And so it really is mental.

(01:08:10):
For those folks, it is about working through resistance as well. When they have a that says, "Oh, I'm behind. The other person is better. I'm not going to be able to do this." Are they believing that or are they working through that resistance and saying, "That's just a story I have. I actually don't know what's going to happen, but I'm going to try to win."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):
I love that you see coaching opportunities in everything even entertainment.

Kenneth Berger (01:08:34):
I mean actually speaking of that, I mean, it's almost too on the nose, but there's this movie living from a couple of years ago. This British actor is this sort of tough, old sort of stodgy government office manager, and he gets diagnosed with cancer. And he has this real transformation where he thinks about, "God, I've just been sitting in an office filing papers my whole life. What do I actually want to do with the last months of my life?" And he builds this playground for children, and that's actually his legacy. Sorry, actually, spoiler alert. Whoops, should've.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
You mentioned tennis and you mentioned British people. I will actually be at Wimbledon this year in London with my dad in July and we're going to host a meetup there while I'm there just for anyone listening right now, just to give you a heads up.

Kenneth Berger (01:09:26):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:27):
How fun is that going to be? Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Kenneth Berger (01:09:33):
Well, it's funny. I used to be a big wine aficionado, and I think as with many of us, I am discovering I feel better with less alcohol in my life. And so one of the things I've been picking up is oolong tea. I've got a little cup of Taiwanese [foreign language 01:09:51] in front of me, and I feel like it's all the nerdery that I put into wine of regions, and varietals, and history and processing, but it's actually good for me. It's like full of antioxidants and makes me more focused and I can drink it during the day. I've been totally going down a nerdy tea rabbit hole, and I recommend it. Taiwanese mountain teas especially.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:16):
I got to give me some of that. I always have tea here when I'm doing these podcasts. I'm a less sophisticated tea drinker. I just go with Earl Grey, but a really nice Earl Grey, and so I'm going to have to buy some of this. Do you have a place in a brand you recommend most?

Kenneth Berger (01:10:30):
There's lots of great stores online. You can check out teafromtaiwan.com. That's a good one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
They're going to get a bunch of traffic. They're like, "What the hell just happened?" Teafromtaiwan.com amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful, share with friends or family and work around life?

Kenneth Berger (01:10:52):
I mean, I'm pretty sure you can guess, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):
I wonder what it might be. I wonder what it might be.

Kenneth Berger (01:11:00):
So this is actually part of why I started writing this book, is because my friends were probably annoyed with me telling them, "Have you asked for what you wanted? Ask for what you want." Because yeah, it's best advice I have is to ask for what you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
It all just comes back to that final question. We've been talking a lot about asking for what you want. Kenneth Berger, what do you want?

Kenneth Berger (01:11:25):
Ooh. All right. Well, I think for me, Lenny, you are already an industry luminary with thousands of followers. I am interested in sharing more of these ideas. So if y'all would come follow me on LinkedIn and subscribe to my newsletter, I'm going to be exploring these ideas and sharing more of this stuff because I just am so passionate about it. I'd love if you'd come and join me in that journey, bring questions and ideas, and I'd love to talk about this stuff because I just find it endlessly interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):
But you're working on a book along these lines at some point that will come out, right?

Kenneth Berger (01:12:03):
That's right, that's right. I am working on it in book form, but part of what I've been doing is I realize I want to work on it in community. Speaking of asking for what you want, I mean, for me, it's not just about my vision and my framing, but I'm a coach. I'm not just about big ideas. I'm about making a difference for my clients. And so I realize, if I really want to make a difference with people, I need... It's like a product, I need to get out in the world and test out these ideas and see what lands with people and what's effective for them and what works, and hear the stories and really get into it. So that's kind of why I've been putting myself more out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):
Amazing. So along those lines, two last questions. Where can folks actually find you online and follow the stuff that you're writing and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kenneth Berger (01:12:47):
So you can find me on LinkedIn. I'm Kenneth Berger, B-E-R-G-E-R. So please follow me there. Subscribe to the Ask for What You Want newsletter. And you can check out my website, kberger.com, K-B-E-R-G-E-R.

## Transcript

Kim Scott (00:00:00):
If you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" Do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Kim Scott. Kim is the author of Radical Candor, which is the single most referenced book on this podcast. The book has sold over 1 million copies, has been translated into twenty-three languages. It was such an honor to have Kim on the podcast. Prior to this book, Kim was a CO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrics, Twitter and many other tech companies. She was a member of the faculty at Apple University. Before that, she led AdSense, YouTube and DoubleClick teams at Google. Prior to that, Kim managed a pediatric clinic in Kosovo and started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow. She's also working on a new book that you can pre-order now called Radical Respect. In our conversation, we get very practical and very tactical about practicing radical candor. Kim briefly describes the core idea, shares, language and phrases and words you can use to get better at practicing radical candor.

(00:01:24):
She shares tips for people-pleasers like myself. Also, a lot of very concrete advice for how to get feedback. Also, what to do if your culture is on the ruinous empathy side of the spectrum, or even worse, obnoxious aggression and so much more. I guarantee listening to this episode will make you a better leader and a better employee. With that, I bring you Kim Scott after a short word from our one featured sponsor for this episode.

(00:01:50):

(00:03:13):
Kim, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:17):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny (00:03:20):
Your book, Radical Candor is the single most recommended book on this podcast. I don't know if you know this podcast well, but at the end of the podcast, I ask every guest, "What are two or three books you recommend most to other people?" And your book has come up the most of any book mentioned on the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:37):
Amazing. Well, tell your listeners I love them and I'm grateful to them.

Lenny (00:03:45):
Okay, they'll hear this. So I'm really excited to have you on chat about all the things that you teach and your book. For people that have heard the term Radical Candor, have maybe skimmed the book, maybe even read the book a while ago, but don't truly remember or understand the concept. Could you just spend just a few minutes giving a high level overview of the concept of Radical Candor?

Kim Scott (00:04:04):
Absolutely. Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, "In the spirit of Radical Candor," and then they act like a garden variety jerk.

(00:05:00):
And that is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That's the spirit of obnoxious aggression. And obnoxious aggression is a big problem. It's a problem because it hurts other people. It's also a problem because it's inefficient. If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.

(00:05:48):
And it's kind of fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read.

Lenny (00:06:40):
Amazing and we'll link to a diagram of this two by two for people that aren't visual thinkers and want to actually see it. So just to make it super clear, if you're challenging directly, basically being very candid with feedback, but it's not clear you care deeply about the person, you call that obnoxious aggression.

Kim Scott (00:06:40):
Yes.

Lenny (00:06:57):
And if you make it clear, you care a lot about the person but aren't actually giving them direct candid feedback, you call that ruinous empathy.

Kim Scott (00:07:05):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:07:06):
Which of these buckets do you find most people fall into? Is there a percentage of people or companies?

Kim Scott (00:07:11):
Yeah, I mean, I would say 90% of us make 90% of our mistakes in that ruinous empathy bucket. It's by far and away the most common problem. But I think all of us make mistakes in the other quadrants as well. And very often we kind of, I think one of, if I'm going to offer some self-criticism of this framework, it's much easier to notice when one has been ruinously empathetic. It's almost like, give yourself some critical feedback. "I work too hard." But it's much harder to notice when we've been manipulatively insincere and obnoxiously aggressive. And maybe I could have named those things because very often manipulative insincerity is sort of self-protective insincerity. Very often obnoxious aggression is just extreme frustration. So I want people to use this framework not to judge themselves or other people harshly, but like a compass to guide specific conversations with specific people to a better place and to help us understand when we're going in the wrong direction, which we are all bound to do on a daily basis.

Lenny (00:08:26):
I want to talk about all those things and also how to get better at these things. But before we do that, it's very hard to change. And it's also hard just to challenge directly innately, it's hard for people to be candid, just to give people a little motivation to invest in this skill. What sort of impact do you see when people develop the skill of being better at radical candor?

Kim Scott (00:08:48):
When we get better at radical candor? I mean, I'll tell you a story in fact about the impact it had on my life, some radical candor, but the sort of abstract answer to your question is we build better relationships and we do better work and we're more successful and we're happier. You ready for a story? Let's do it. Love stories. Okay. So shortly after I joined Google, this was now a very long time ago, 2004, I had to give a presentation to the founders and the CEO about how the AdSense business was doing. And I walked into the room and there in one corner of the room was one of the founders on an elliptical trainer wearing toe shoes and a bright blue spandex unitard, super tight, not what I was expecting or frankly wanting to see in the room. And there in the other corner of the room was the CEO doing his emails like his brain had been plugged into the machine.

(00:09:49):
So probably like you in such a situation, I felt a little bit nervous. How was I supposed to get these people's attention? Luckily for me, the AdSense business was on fire. And when I said how many new customers we had added, the CEO almost fell off his chair. "What did you say? This is incredible. Do you need more engineers? Do you need more marketing dollars?" So I'm thinking the meeting's going all right. In fact, I now believe that I am a genius. And I walked out of the room, I walked past my boss and I was expecting a high five a pat on the back. And instead she said to me, "Why don't you walk back to my office with me?" And I thought, Oh gosh, I screwed something up in there and I'm sure I'm about to hear about it. And she began not by telling me what I had done wrong, but what had gone well in the meeting, not in the feedback sandwich.

(00:10:37):
I think there's a less polite term for that. I'm not sure how you feel about cussing on your podcast.

Lenny (00:10:37):
It's acceptable, fully acceptable.

Kim Scott (00:10:43):
Not in the shit sandwich since the word, but really seeming to mean what she said. But of course, all I wanted to do was hear about what I had done wrong. And eventually she said to me, "You said um a lot in there, were you aware of it?" And with this, I braved a huge sigh of relief if that was all I had done wrong who really cared. And I kind of made this brush off gesture with my hand. I said, "Yeah, I know, it's a verbal tech. It's no big deal, really." And then she said to me, "I know this great speech coach. I bet Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?" And once again, I made this brush off gesture with my hand.

(00:11:14):
I said, "Oh, I'm busy. I don't have time for a speech coach. Didn't you hear about all these new customers?" And then she said to me, "I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid." Now she's got my full attention. And some people might say it was mean of her to say I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the kindest thing that she could have done for me at that moment in my career because she knew me well enough to know that if she didn't use just those words with me, and by the way, this is a really important point, she never would've used those words with other people on her team who were perhaps a better listener than I was.

(00:11:56):
But she knew me well enough. She cared personally enough to know that if she didn't use those words with me, I never would've gone to visit the speech coach and I wouldn't have learned that she was not exaggerating. And this was news to me because I had raised millions of dollars for two different startups giving presentations. I thought I was pretty good at it. And it really got me to thinking sort of why had no one told me. It was almost like I suddenly realized I'd been marching through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach in between my teeth and nobody had had the common courtesy to tell me it was there. So why had no one else told me. But what was it about her leadership style that made it so seemingly easy for her to tell me? And as I thought about that, I realized it really came down to those two things.

(00:12:41):
She cared personally and she challenged directly. She cared about me not just as an employee but as a human being. For example, when my father was diagnosed with late stage cancer, I was devastated and she could tell that I was devastated. And she said, "Kim, look, you go to the airport, fly home to Memphis, you need to be with your family. Your team and I will sit down and write your coverage plan." That's what great teams do for one another. And those were the kinds of things, that was the kind of thing that she did. She couldn't do, of course, for all 5,000 people in her organization, no matter how talented you are, relationships don't scale. But she did do those things for her direct reports and the people who she worked most closely with, all of us.

(00:13:27):
And when a leader treats their team, the people who they interact with on a day-to-day basis with that kind of real care, then it's much more likely that their direct reports in turn are going to treat their teams with real care. And that creates a culture of caring. And even though relationships don't scale, culture does scale. So that was part of it. But of course there's also this challenge directly part which is equally as important. And I learned very quickly beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I screwed up, she was going to tell me and she was going to keep telling me until it penetrated my sometimes thick skull.

Lenny (00:14:07):
I had a manager that was also very good at this. He was very good at just giving me very direct feedback, and I knew that he was only doing it because he cared about my future. To kind of follow this thread and get a little tactical, is there language or phrases or ways of communicating that you recommend people use to either challenge directly and avoid people getting defensive or make it clear you care deeply?

Kim Scott (00:14:31):
People always want me to give them a script. And the problem with the script is that if I write it, you're going to sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself. And then people won't really think you mean what you're saying. But I do think there are some important things to consider when having these conversations. I think you want to go into the conversation, and by the way, everything I'm about to say applies to praise as much as it does to criticism. And I want to pause for a moment. That story is helpful because that's the kind of thing that has happened to so many of us, that's not unique to me. However, praise is even more important than criticism in terms of radical candor. Radical candor is not all about the boss giving the employee criticism. It should always start with soliciting feedback and it should include more praise and criticism, but anyway, way without offering up shit sandwiches.

(00:15:31):
So anyway, I think that the important thing for these conversations, these sort of two-minute impromptu moments of management, is to go into the conversation being humble. To me, I call it candor and not truth because if I march into a room and I say, "Lenny, I'm going to tell you the truth." I'm kind of implying I've got a pipeline to God and you don't know anything. And that's not what this is all about. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. So to me, candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also curious to know how you understand the conversation. So you want to go in being humble, you might be wrong, and that's totally fine. Omniscience is not a requirement for radical candor, thank heavens. So you want to be humble. You want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to remember in your own head and you want to make it explicit to the other person that you're telling them this to help them.

(00:16:25):
You're not trying to be dominant or kick them in the shins or anything like that. You're telling them this because you care about them. So you want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to have these conversations right away, almost immediately. I mean, there's exceptions to everything I'm saying. None of this is absolute. But usually if I'm telling myself and Lenny, you can tell me if you have the same problem, but if I tell myself, Oh, I'm going to wait for a better moment to tell this person this thing, what I'm really saying is I'm never going to say. So if the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and the purpose of criticism is to tell them what to do less of, why wait. So you want to do it immediately unless you are so upset that you're going to say it in a terrible way or the other person is so upset that they can't hear you. But usually that's not the case.

(00:17:16):
You also want, and in the before times I used to say have these conversations in person. Now I say have these conversations synchronously and I'm going to recommend phone over video. There's a lot of evidence coming out of University of Chicago and probably other places, but that's the article I've read that there's more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language, especially if somebody is just a little square on a computer screen. But it also may be true in real life, like the phone actually may be one of our best communication innovations of all time because when you're talking to someone on the phone, you're listening to the words that they are saying to you, and that is really what you want to do in this moment. So make sure that you're having these conversations synchronously, because what you want to do next is gauge how it's landing.

(00:18:15):
So I'll talk about that in a minute. And you can't gauge how something is landing if you're sending an email or a text, and Slack is just a feedback train wreck waiting to happen. I once coached someone who kept giving feedback over Slack and I finally just quit coaching him. I was like, "If you keep making this mistake, I can't be your coach." So don't do that. Take a moment to pick up the phone and call the person. Go back to those old AT&T commercials when I was a kid. Reach out and touch someone. You want to show you care.

(00:18:52):
So let's review. You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count.

(00:19:21):
And so let's double-click though on this not about personality point. I think it's really important to remember that for both praise and criticism, you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, result, it made you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE, you can think about that as CORE. I used to call it CORN, but I got some feedback that corn is like some shorthand for porn on TikTok. So I call it CORE instead, HIP CORE.

Lenny (00:20:16):
Wow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. So the E at the end stands for?

Kim Scott (00:20:20):
Next step, big E.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Oh, I see the E is the next, you skipped the N, clever.

Kim Scott (00:20:26):
Yes. I don't know, clever or ridiculous. Maybe I should just call it HIP CORN,

Lenny (00:20:31):
Right? No, I think either one's great. So you share this example of the speaking example. Maybe if we can do another example just to reinforce this framework.

Kim Scott (00:20:43):
Let's do a little ruinous empathy.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Okay, great. Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:20:47):
How about that? That is the mistake. I think that I am really focused in the book Radical Candor and also in my next book Radical Respect. That's the mistake I really want to eliminate.

Lenny (00:21:00):
Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:21:00):
Because ruinous empathy creates this false harmony, which is really bad. So here's my ruinous empathy story. I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob, and I liked Bob a lot. He was smart, he was charming, he was funny. He would do stuff like we're at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get to know you games. And everybody was getting more and more and more stressed out. So start up, we've got a lot going on. And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand and to say, "I can tell everyone is getting stressed. I want to get to know all of you. I've got an idea. It'll help us do that and it'll be really fast."

(00:21:41):
Whatever his idea was, if it was really fast, we were down with it. And Bob says, "Let's just go around the table and confess what candy our parents used when potty training us." Really weird but really fast. And then for the next 10 months, every time there was a tense moment in a meeting, Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy for the right person at the right moment. And we all remember that was the weirder thing. Like Hershey Kisses right here. That was what my parents used to potty train me.

(00:22:16):
And so Bob was quirky, but he brought a little levity to the office. Everybody kind of loved working with Bob. There was one problem with Bob. He was doing terrible work. He would hand stuff into me and there was shame in his eyes. He kind of knew it wasn't good enough. He was very creative, but riddled with sloppy mistakes. And I would say something to Bob along the lines of, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better." So let's pause for a moment. Why did I say such a banal thing to Bob? I think part of the problem was that I liked Bob and I really didn't want to hurt his feelings.

(00:23:05):
So that was the ruinous empathy part of why I said that. But also part of the problem was something more insidious, a little bit of manipulative insincerity, because Bob was popular and Bob was also sensitive kind of. And there was part of me that was afraid if I told Bob in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough, he would get upset. He might even start to cry and then everybody would think I was a big, you know what? So the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader, that was the manipulative insincerity part, the part of me that was worried about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part. And this went on for 10 months, 10 long months, and I was so puzzled the whole time I couldn't understand what was going on. I learned much later that one of the issues perhaps was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom three times a day, which maybe explained all that candy that he had at all times.

(00:24:11):
But I didn't know any of that at the time. All I knew is that Bob was consistently doing bad work, but I wasn't really dealing with it. And eventually the inevitable happened. I realized that if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work.

(00:24:46):
And the people who were best at their jobs were going to quit because they wanted to be able to do their best work. They were going to go to a different company where they could do their best work. And so I sat down to have a conversation with Bob that I should have begun frankly 10 months previously. And when I finished explaining to him where things stood, he kind of pushed his chair back from the table. He looked me right in the eye and he said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me." And now I realized that by not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all. But it was too late to say Bob because at this point even he agreed he should go because his reputation on the team was just shot.

(00:25:46):
All I could do in the moment was make myself a very solemn promise that I would never make that mistake again, and that I would do everything in my power to help other people avoid making that mistake. It was so painful. It was painful for me. It was painful for Bob, much more painful for Bob actually, and it was bad for the whole team and it was bad for our investors. We weren't getting results because of my ruinous empathy and ruinous empathy slash manipulative insincerity. It's much harder to admit the manipulative insincerity part. And that is really why I'm here talking to you because I want all of your listeners to avoid making that mistake because it's the most painful and the most common mistake that I think leaders and not just leaders, I mean all of us make this mistake in all of our relationships.

Lenny (00:26:41):
I love that this also gives an example of the impact of getting better at this point of you'll lose not just the people that are not necessarily great, but also other high performers on the team because they're seeing people slip through the cracks that aren't amazing. And if you're not practicing this early, your team basically becomes not high performing.

Kim Scott (00:27:00):
Yeah, exactly. You're going to lose your top performers. And I think very often people are afraid to tell someone on their team when their work isn't good enough because they're afraid of losing them. But that's not a good reason. You should be helping this person to improve. This person deserves to have a job where they can excel and you either help them excel on this team or you help them find a different job where they can excel, because everyone can do great work somewhere. And Bob could have done great work. Maybe I would've helped him keep it to the weekends because he's very creative and very smart, but the floppy mistakes just got in the way of his ability to do his best work.

Lenny (00:27:50):
So following that thread, I imagine the reason you didn't tell him early, and most people don't do this well, is many people are, you can maybe call them people pleasers. I'm a recovering people pleaser, I'll say. It's just hard to give people hard feedback. You want people to like you. It's not a natural state for a lot of people. What do you find helps people get over this kind of need to be liked as a leader and helps them be more candid?

Kim Scott (00:28:15):
I think that one of the things that was helpful for me anyway, so you can tell me if it's helpful for you, was realizing that my job was not to be liked. My job was to care about other people and to get out of my own head and to become others focused is what helped me kind of let go of the need to be liked. I think that also as a woman, I think there was something extra, as my teenage children would say, there was something extra for me because the sort of likability- competence bias that a lot of women face pushed me, especially early in my career, in the wrong direction on challenge directly.

(00:29:04):
And it made it much harder for me to, because often I would say something and I would say it even more gently than my colleagues who were men, but people would say, "Ah, Kim is a real whatever." And they weren't saying, Kim is obnoxious. I was being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression and it wasn't obnoxious or they were accusing me of being bossy or or abrasive or whatever. And it's really hard. I would also say when it comes to eliciting feedback, it's really important to be open to it and it's really important to separate the wheat from the chaff from the feedback you're getting.

Lenny (00:29:41):
So in this example of Bob, say you were to do it now, what would you do differently other than give him feedback earlier? Is there something you've learned about just how you would've phrased it or approached it?

Kim Scott (00:29:58):
I think probably what I would do, and I would love to hear what you would've said to Bob too, I certainly don't have all the answers, but probably what I would've said is let's go back to the first time Bob handed work into me with shame in his eyes. I would've said, "Bob, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression on your face, but it looks to me like you are not happy with this. What's going on?" And so I would've asked him to diagnose it himself and I want to pause on that because that can be very risky. He might have said to me, "I think this is awesome. This is my best work," and now I've kind of made my job of giving him feedback a little bit harder. So it's not always the right thing to ask questions, but I would've tried to ask it before I had examined the work when I noticed that he looked uncomfortable himself.

(00:30:47):
And I think also another thing I've learned about noticing, I said earlier that there's a lot of evidence that we often misinterpret each other's facial expressions and body language. So I would've tried to say that with some humility, it seems like you're not, maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look to me like you're happy with this. And I would've given him an opportunity to say, "Yeah, maybe I need to do it again." Let's imagine though that he said, "Oh no, it's awesome. It's ready." So then I get it and I look at it. I would have not been shy about pointing out very specifically every problem that I saw in that piece of work, every single one. Sometimes it can be tempting when you're giving someone feedback to say, "Oh, there's a number of careless mistakes here. Can you go back and look at it again," and the person will notice a few of them and then you got to go, sometimes it's useful to show someone a pattern.

(00:31:53):
All of the careless mistakes, especially if someone is defensive or if you think they're likely to be defensive, if you think they're likely to do to you what I did to my boss, oh no, everything's fine. It's no big deal. You need to move out on the challenge directly dimension. You need to be prepared to keep going until you have communicated with a person. And that was really the problem with Bob. He probably would not have started to cry. I think my fear around his tears was probably more about my fear than what was actually likely to happen. But I think we do fear someone else getting upset more often than they actually get upset. We have kind of a negativity bias when it comes to part of the reason why we're reluctant to give feedback.

Lenny (00:32:42):
And I think to your point, that we want to be liked, like you said, that you should get over that. I think that's obviously very hard just to be like, "Nah, I'm not going to worry about that." But I think your point is really important that you'll be liked later if you don't do the hard thing now. It'll only get worse if you just let it continue happening.

Kim Scott (00:33:01):
And I think also for me to say to myself going into that conversation, it's more important for me to demonstrate care, that I care about Bob than it is for Bob to like me, and if I demonstrate that I care about Bob, then I'm going to do the right thing that will ultimately create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob. Me pulling my punches did not create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob.

Lenny (00:33:31):
I actually did that and I learned this from a manager of mine is just almost work backwards from ask them, what do you want to achieve in your career? Where do you want to go in this company and make sure they know you know what they want, and then basically work backwards from to get there. Here's the things you need to get, and here's the thing you did recently that isn't necessarily on the track and here's what we should be working on if you want to get to the skull that you have.

Kim Scott (00:33:57):
Yeah, I think one of the really important things that all managers can do for their direct reports to show that they care is to have real meaningful career conversations, where you talk about their life story, sort of their past, whatever part of it they're comfortable talking to you about so that you understand what motivates them at work. And I would have three separate 45 minute conversations, so one about their past, one about their future, their dreams for the future, and it's not just the next couple of years. It's like imagine at the height of your career you have everything you want. What does it look like? And give me three or four different pictures of that because very few of us know what we want to do when we grow up.

(00:34:40):
Then the third conversation is to sort of sit down with your director report and come up with a career action plan. So given what motivates you and where you want to go, what are the skills that it would be useful for you to develop so that you can get where you want to go and who can I introduce you to? What are the educational opportunities? Can we tweak your job so that you're gaining those skills so you're at least taking a step in the direction of your dreams, even if you're not there yet?

Lenny (00:35:11):
Awesome. I have a post about this. I'll link to in the show notes that gives people a guide to having these conversations, and there's a spreadsheet I share with people like, here's an action plan you can come up with your teammate and here's what you're going to work on these next six months.

Kim Scott (00:35:24):
Did you read the book When they Win, You Win by Russ Laraway?

Lenny (00:35:24):
No.

Kim Scott (00:35:29):
Oh, he has a hundred pages on career conversations and he's also built sort of some tools that help people. So check that out.

Lenny (00:35:39):
And it's called When You Win... When They Win, You Win.

Kim Scott (00:35:41):
When They Win, You Win.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Amazing.

Kim Scott (00:35:42):
Yes, by Russ Laraway, he and I worked together at Google and then we started a company together.

Lenny (00:35:48):
Oh wow. Okay, cool. We'll link to them in the show notes. Maybe I'll get him on the podcast too. Great.

Kim Scott (00:35:51):
Yeah, he'd be great.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Okay, so we've been chatting about ways individually to get better at some of these skills. Another area that I think people struggle with is the company culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback. So there's a question, so you probably saw this on Twitter. I asked people, what should I ask you? And a lot of people came in with a lot of questions and there's one that came in from Pete, so I'm just going to read it along these lines. So this question is just how do you practice being radically candid in a culture? And most cultures are like this where people aren't ready for direct feedback. Since company culture is often closer to ruinous empathy and being radically candid is more of a long-term good than a short-term good. You could potentially risk retention with your employees if you're too direct with them. So how do you think about finding this balance of being candid but not pissing people off, or do you just hire people that are open and ready for direct feedback and that's kind of how you solve that problem?

Kim Scott (00:36:45):
I don't think you can only hire people who are open and ready for direct feedback because it's hard for all of us. I just want to acknowledge that, it's hard for me. I mean, I wrote the book, I believe in it to my core and sometimes it's still hard for me. It's hard for me to hear it and it's hard for me to deliver it. This is a really difficult thing to do. The good thing about that two by two is it makes it look easy, which is useful, but it's not easy. So anyway, I think there are, to answer Pete's question, I think there are a few things that can help. There's really an order of operations to radical candor, and if you begin with soliciting criticism, then you take the first and most important step to improving your relationship with that person enough that it becomes easier for you to give it as well as to get it.

(00:37:35):
So I want to leave folks with some sort of steps on how to solicit feedback, and this is true, especially if you're a boss, but it's true in all your relationships. You can use this at home as well. So if you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." Nobody in your life accepts your teenage children. If you have teenage children, they'd really want to give you some criticism, but nobody else in your life really wants to give you criticism. And so you want to think about how you're going to ask the person that's going to be most likely to elicit a response. The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" But do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you.

(00:38:33):
I was working with Christa Quarles when she was CEO of OpenTable and she said, "Kim, I could never imagine those words coming out of my mouth." She said, "The way I like to ask is tell me why I'm wrong." Okay, that's fine too. It demands an answer to her question. But of course there were a couple of people on her team who felt that that was too aggressive, that shut them down, so she had to adjust her question. Being authentic does not mean ignoring the impact you're having on others. So you want to think about your question, you want to think about who you're going to ask that question of, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:39:22):
Let's spend more time on this actually. So what is it you recommend, that they pick? How many people would you recommend they pick, and ask feedback from?

Kim Scott (00:39:28):
Well, I think if you are a manager, you need to be soliciting every week feedback from each of your direct reports, and you need to sort of, I would budget five minutes at the end of your one-on-one to solicit feedback. So mostly a one-on-one should be your employees setting the agenda and your employee's time and don't by the way, save up when you have to give feedback. Don't save it up for your one-on-one and definitely don't save it up for a performance review. You want to give that in the moment. We can talk more about that in a second, but when you're soliciting feedback, save five minutes at the end of your one-on-one and ask that go-to question. And you also want to ask that go-to question of your cross-functional peers who you work most closely with and of your boss. And I think you don't want to ask the same question every single time. It'll start to sound like you don't really want the answer, but you want to make this part of your daily weekly routine with the people who you interact most closely with.

Lenny (00:40:34):
So you added to the end of this your one-on-one agenda, and two versions of this question are, what am I doing wrong? Which is that one I guess you iterated.

Kim Scott (00:40:43):
Tell me why I'm wrong or what am I doing wrong or what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me? Or what should I stop doing? What should I start doing? What should I continue doing? Those are some common ones. What do you like to ask Lenny?

Lenny (00:41:00):
I think it was something along the lines of like, what's one thing I could be doing better or what's one way I could be helping you be more successful?

Kim Scott (00:41:07):
That's a really good one. What's one way I could help you be more successful? Or Jason Rosoff, my co founder at Radical Candor likes to ask, "What could I have done this week?" So he time, he time bounds it. "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" In fact, Jason told me after we had worked together for about a month, he was like, "Kim, I really hate your go-to question." He said, "It's too open-ended for me. If you can tell me what you're working on and ask me at the end of a meeting specifically what I noticed then that is much better."

Lenny (00:41:48):
How often do you accept no answer? Just like, no everything's great.

Kim Scott (00:41:52):
Never,

Lenny (00:41:53):
Never,

Kim Scott (00:41:53):
Never. I mean, there are some people who really don't like to be put on the spot. So if I can tell that I'm inflicting a cruel and unusual punishment on the person, I'll say, "Look, you know I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something, notice something. It's the thing that you can do that would help me more than anything else that you could do is to tell me when I'm wrong because I need to know that." In fact, Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel said he used to at the end of his one-on-ones say to people, "There's one more thing. And he explained to me that that was coded Intel for like this is the most important thing." I was working at Apple at the time and I said, "Oh, did you get that from Steve Jobs?"

(00:42:47):
That was always how he introduced, "Just one more thing, the iPad." And Andy got immediately very grumpy and very offended, and he said, "No, we both got it from Colombo. The detective show." You can get tips from anywhere. So you want to make sure that you're though letting the person know that you really do care about what they say and that it's really when they give you this critical feedback that you're going to reward it. But that's not the end. Asking that question is only the first step, the bad news about your question, no matter how hard you think about it, and no matter how good a question it is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. There's no such thing as emotional Novocaine. That's why I don't believe in scripts. People believe if I just say the magic words like the door will open, that's not how it works. It's a give and take. So you want to sort of be prepared to embrace that discomfort. The only way out is through. Simplest way to embrace the discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six.

(00:43:59):
Only made it to three just there, and your eyes were popping out.

Lenny (00:44:03):
That is so long.

Kim Scott (00:44:04):
Six seconds is a really long time. Almost nobody can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something. So now you've dragged this poor soul out on a conversational limb that they never wanted to go on. They're probably going to say something. The third step is to make sure that you listen with the intent to understand not to respond, because you're probably going to feel defensive and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal or that you're shut down the feedback. All it means is that you're human. And that's all part of this. You want to figure out how to manage your natural defensive reaction to critical feedback, which you're probably going to have. The simplest tactic I can offer folks there is to think of some follow-up questions.

(00:44:56):
So at breakfast, my daughter not too long ago said to me, "Mom, I wish you weren't the Radical Candor lady." And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me and I thought, ah, I'm spending too much time at work. She wants more of my time. I shouldn't be traveling so much. But then I thought, well, I should ask her, make sure I understood. I'm jumping to conclusions here. I'm not listening with the intent to understand. So I asked a follow-up question. I said, "Well, who do you wish I were?" And she said, "I wish you were the lady who minded her own business," so I could go spend a little more time at work as far as she was concerned. So you want to make sure you really understand what a person is telling you. And once you feel certain that you really do understand and that you've been open to it, the last and most important step is to reward the candor.

(00:45:46):
A person takes a huge risk, especially if this person is your employee. A person takes a huge risk to give you critical feedback. And if you do not reward that risk richly, you're never going to get any feedback again. So if you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible, be loud. So-and-so told me that the tea in the break room is terrible, and now we have thirty-five different kinds of tea. Thank you for telling me. And that can demonstrate to people that they're not wasting their breath to come to you. That if you become aware of a problem, you'll fix it. And you also want to, by the way, you want to ask for feedback after you fixed it. Did I over-correct or did I under-correct?

(00:46:31):
My boss at Google, the same boss from the um story also told me when she gave me some feedback that I tended to move too fast. And she said, "Kim, until people and giving you feedback that you're going too slow. You won't have corrected this problem." So you kind of want to shoot to over-correct if you get some critical feedback. I also want to though pause on what to do when you get some critical feedback that you disagree with because it can be easy to feel wedged here. And if all you do is say thank you for the feedback, the other person is going to hear something much less polite than a brush off or worse.

(00:47:10):
And so what you want to do is you want to look for that five or 10% of whatever the person said that you can agree with, and you want to give voice to that. And then what you want to do is you want to say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you." And then you've got to get back to them. You got to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree. And it's tempting to feel like a disagreement poses a risk to our relationships, but it's not disagreement that poses a risk to our relationships. It's unspoken disagreement. Many, I don't know about you Lenny, but a lot of my best professional relationships began with a good respectful disagreement.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Interesting. That reminds me of just watching Squid Games, the reality show on Netflix. Yeah. Have you seen this at all?

Kim Scott (00:47:56):
I haven't watched it, but it's on my list.

Lenny (00:47:59):
There's this guy who makes a huge bad decision on behalf of his whole team and they hate him in the show. And then on TikTok, he shared that they're best friends now, even though they called him a big idiot.

Kim Scott (00:48:09):
Yeah, no.

Lenny (00:48:09):
So funny.

Kim Scott (00:48:10):
It can happen for sure.

(00:49:32):
So to recap the steps roughly for how to get feedback from people, it's ask your question like what's one thing I could have done this week to make you more successful? Wait six seconds potentially or try to, it's very hard. Ask a few follow-up questions to make sure you understand what they're saying and then find a way to reward them. Say thank you.

Kim Scott (00:49:53):
Do more than say thank you.

Lenny (00:49:55):
Especially if you disagree, which is a really interesting nuance of this. I had Jules Walter on the podcast. I always think of him when I think of getting feedback. He shared this advice. When you get feedback, just be so appreciative so that people keep giving me just like, "Thank you so much for that feedback." The way he phrases it. Even if you're melting inside and really hate this feedback, just like, "thank you, I really appreciate it." But I think your nuance there is really key is if you do disagree, I really like this tip of just like, let me think about this element of it and then actually follow up.

Kim Scott (00:50:25):
Even if you're melting inside, if you say thank you and you're melting inside, I mean maybe it's a terrible actor, but usually people know. And that's why I say it's not enough to say thank you. You got to fix the problem and then show what you did to fix the problem and get more feedback. Did I over-correct? Did I under-correct. And if you disagree, you got to say that you disagree, but you got to say, so respectfully.

Lenny (00:50:48):
As a leader, this sounds like a lot of work to be doing every week. If you have a one-on-one following up correcting things. Is there anything you'd recommend there? Or is it just, this is really important, you got to make time.

Kim Scott (00:50:58):
It's not as much work as failing to do this as we saw from the Bob story. So I think that the important thing that I have found is that this is part of why it's so important to do it immediately. It's important for the other person, but it's also important for you. If you're doing this in a one-on-one, which you should be having anyway. So you're saving some time in a one-on-one. So it's not adding time necessarily to your day. And when you hear about problems, you should fix them. Yes, it takes time, but that is your job. And when you disagree with something, you can disagree in your next regularly scheduled one-on-one. So I'm not talking about adding meetings to your calendar, so it doesn't actually take more time. I have found that in fact, it saves tremendous amounts of time, but it does take emotional discipline.

(00:51:52):
And I think it also requires you, especially when it comes to giving it, which we talked about before, where the humble, helpful, those are impromptu two-minute conversations, giving the feedback that you should be having in between your meetings. In the um story, walk to my meeting with me, it didn't take any extra time for my boss to give me that feedback. She had to walk to her meeting anyway, and I had to go in the same direction. So it didn't even take extra time from me. But it is, I think one of the most common reasons why people don't do this in addition to fear of retaliation and just sort of existential dread, which are both factors, which hopefully we've helped alleviate, but is that you're scheduled back to back to back and you don't have those two minutes in between meetings.

(00:52:42):
And that's why I think it's important either to schedule slack time in your calendar, make your 30 minute meetings, 25 minute meetings, make your hour-long meetings, 50 minute meetings, maybe give yourself a few breaks in the day. But if it's not possible, and often it was not possible for me in my career to sort of schedule my time that way, I just decided that these moments of management were more important than being on time to my next meeting. And so I was just late sometimes. So I wish I had a better answer than either control your time, which is really annoying advice because it's impossible to follow or be willing to be late to your next meeting. But those were the things that I tried to do.

Lenny (00:53:34):
That was super helpful. I think your point of just, if you're not making two minutes to do this thing now, it'll be a lot more time intensive later.

Kim Scott (00:53:40):
Oh yeah. It's stitch in time takes nine on all these two minute, and really it should be brushing and flossing. This is not like a root canal. These are like, this is relationship hygiene that you should be doing all the time.

Lenny (00:53:55):
I was just reading Charlie Munger's book and there's a quote that he references of just the classic, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Kim Scott (00:54:03):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny (00:54:04):
Same idea. So we've talked about a leader getting feedback. What if you're the employee? Do you also recommend the same thing in the one-on-one, have an agenda item and ask this question? Or is there a different approach you'd recommend?

Kim Scott (00:54:16):
I think yes, if you're the employee, you should also be soliciting feedback on a regular basis from your boss. So there's sort of an order of operations you want to solicit at first, no matter who you are, it's the same up, down, and sideways, even though it feels very different, the order of operations is the same. So start by soliciting feedback. Then you want to give both praise and criticism. I think sometimes it feels like you're kissing up if you give your boss praise, but bosses need praise too. And if there are things that your boss does that you appreciate and you want your boss to do more of those things, praise is a better tool for that than criticism. When it comes time to offering your boss some critical feedback, you want to make sure, and by the way, this is also true when it comes time to give your employee critical feedback or your spouse or anybody else in your life, you want to be sure that you are prepared to gauge how it lands.

(00:55:09):
So you want to start in kind of a neutral place. You don't want to go to the outer edge of challenge directly because then you're going to wind up in obnoxious aggression. So if we go back to that story, my boss started, "You said um a lot, were you aware of it?" "Nah." That was my response. And then "I know this great speech coach, would you like an introduction?" "Nah," was my response. So she had to keep going out on that challenge directly. She didn't start out by saying, "When you say um I'm every third word, it makes you sound stupid." But she realized she had to go that far. So you want to keep going out if you think they're brushing you off. But if you find that your boss looks either sad or mad, that is your cue to move up on the care personally dimension.

(00:55:51):
And so to take a moment, and if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly. I don't know about you Lenny, but if I say something to someone and they look sad, it's so tempting for me to try to pull the words back. "Oh no, it's no big deal. I didn't mean it," but it is a big deal, and I did mean it, that's why I just said it. And so if you go the wrong way on challenge directly, you wind up in ruinous empathy, and then you leave the person both sad and confused, so you make it worse.

(00:56:34):
So you want to take a beat to pay attention to the emotions in the moment, but not to go the wrong way on challenge directly. Same thing if they're mad, although if somebody's mad, that maybe is even harder. If somebody starts yelling at me, it's tempting for me either to start yelling back and wind up in obnoxious aggression or to crawl off to a self-protective, manipulative insincerity. And so instead, what I try to do is get curious, not furious, and why is this person so mad? So say like, Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it.

Lenny (00:57:14):
This comes back to the point you made about when you're giving feedback to try to do it in person or on a phone call to do exactly what you're saying, to read them as you're giving this feedback and figure out which axis you want to go down.

Kim Scott (00:57:25):
Yeah, you want to gauge it. I mean, when we communicate with other people, we communicate on an emotional level and on an intellectual level at the same time. And if we ignore the emotional signals that are coming at us or say don't take it personally, then we're just not going to communicate very well.

Lenny (00:57:43):
Along these same lines, another question that came in is from a coach of yours that works I think for you or somehow with the program. She asked this question of many top leaders have very low self-awareness. They believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to give feedback, or they just ignore the problem and fire people with no feedback. Is there something you've learned about how to change their mind about this is the way to operate?

Kim Scott (00:58:05):
Yeah, I think the most important thing with leaders like that, that you can do is to explain to them the impact that they're having and to also show them that there is another way that is going to help them succeed. Very often the leaders who are low on the care personally dimension, they do care about their results and they do care about their own careers. And so when you sort of explain this to them in terms of enlightened self-interest, they tend to get better at it. And also, I mean there I can think of maybe one or two people I've worked with who are truly low on care, who truly don't care. Very often people are bad at showing they care, but they do actually care. And also sometimes there are leaders who think they're not supposed to care. And so unleashing that capacity that they innately have to care and telling them this is actually part of the job can make them a much better, more effective leader. But look, if someone is a psychopath and they truly don't care, they shouldn't be a manager. That's the solution.

Lenny (00:59:27):
I totally get that one. So I really like that takeaway. Just basically show them the impact they're having because to your point, they want the company to succeed. They want their team to succeed. And if they're not realizing there's downsides to the way they're operating.

Kim Scott (00:59:38):
And they want themselves to succeed. That's why I say part of the problem with obnoxious aggression is that you harm other people, but it's also inefficient because when you act like that, people can't hear what you're saying, so you're wasting your breath.

Lenny (00:59:56):
And the way you show them that impact. Do you recommend interviewing people, getting stories, seeing, I don't know, how do you collect this impact so that they're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this.

Kim Scott (01:00:07):
I think that the best thing to do is, for me anyway, is I start by sharing stories from my career and stories when I was a jerk. I've acted like a jerk too, plenty of times, unfortunately. And I show the impact that I've had and then I ask them for a similar story. And usually sort of me holding up the mirror to myself is useful for them to be able to hold the mirror up to themselves to realize you want to help these people adopt a growth mindset around this stuff. I am not telling you that you're an asshole. I'm telling you that we all behave like assholes sometimes. And it's a big problem for us as well as for the people around us. And here's my story, when I acted like a jerk, what's yours? And people, that kind of self-awareness, sometimes people talk about inflicted insight like it's some kind of burden, but usually that kind of self-awareness makes people feel lighter. They're like, "Ah, now I know what's wrong and now I know what I can do about it."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah, I've definitely noticed that about your stories. They always are you making the mistake, which I think is very disarming.

Kim Scott (01:01:20):
We all make mistakes.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Yeah. Maybe the extreme of this obnoxious aggressiveness is Bridgewater. Their whole approach is like theirs.

Kim Scott (01:01:31):
Oh my gosh. Did you read the book The Fund?

Lenny (01:01:34):
No, not yet.

Kim Scott (01:01:35):
You must read it. It's all about Bridgewater. I always thought it was problematic. I had no idea just how problematic it is. Put that book in the show notes one of the best business books I've read in the last decade.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Wow, that is high praise. Yes, I will read that. And so I guess for people that aren't familiar, like Bridgewater, they encourage, they have a system called Dots where they tell people, you must give hard critical feedback after every meeting, publicly.

Kim Scott (01:02:01):
Not after the meeting, in the meeting, publicly. And it's recorded on, it was, I think they changed it since, but it was recorded for posterity on video. And sometimes, in fact, true story, shortly after I left Google, I was approached to work at Bridgewater in a management capacity, not in an investment capacity. And so I called someone I knew who worked there and he said, "Let me give you an anecdote." He said, "The other day there was a meeting and there was a woman who in the meeting who had made a mistake and everybody just piled on. The criticism was very personal. There was no core about the criticism. It was like, these are your personality attributes that make you a useless human being. Kind of terrible feedback until she started to cry and the whole meeting was recorded and then they emailed a recording of the meeting out to the whole company, including all the people who were not in the meeting saying, this is an example of how to have..." So I would say that is deep, dark, obnoxious aggression. That is not radical candor. That is horrible.

Lenny (01:03:24):
So it's safe to say you're not a fan of that approach?

Kim Scott (01:03:26):
No. In fact, I did an analysis of Dalio's book Principles and it's like a, I don't know, 3 or 400 page book. And there were I think four or five pages about caring about people. There's very low care personally.

Lenny (01:03:44):
I imagine many people see that, they see Elon, they see Steve Jobs, and the perception is they're very challenge directly people, they're not clearly care about you people, but they're very successful. What do you say to people that are like, but it works. Why wouldn't I be that if that's the way I want to do it?

Kim Scott (01:04:00):
Well, first of all, I would not put Steve Jobs in the same category as Ray Dalio and Elon Musk. I mean, Steve Jobs could be obnoxiously aggressive, but mostly I would say he built such good relationships with his direct reports that when he got cancer, Tim Cook offered to give him half his liver. And I don't know of a word to describe that other than love. These were real human relationships. When I worked at Apple, you could see Steve and Johnny talking. You could tell these people cared about each other. Now, radical candor gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And I think that Steve had built a team around him of people who didn't mind rather what other people would consider obnoxious aggression. But I think in the context of their relationship, it was understood as care.

(01:05:03):
I'll give you an example of that from my own career, not that I am comparing myself to Steve Jobs, I think I'm a much gentler person, but sometimes I develop relationships with people. And part of that relationship is that we push each other pretty hard. So there was a person who I had worked with for a long time, for many years. He had followed me from one company to another, and we were localizing a product and he kept conflating Slovakia and Slovenia, and I corrected him once. I corrected him twice the third time, I was like, did Slovakia, not Slovenia dumb ass.

(01:05:44):
And he started laughing, and that was fine in the context of our relationship, but I realized that the people around me, I was silencing them. They were like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to make a mistake. Kim's going to call me a dumb ass." So I had to pause and say, "Look, I respect this person enormously, and I like this person enormously. We work very well together." And so I think that sometimes people have relationships with others and they have those relationships in public and other people misinterpret those relationships.

(01:06:19):
Steve Jobs was not perfect. He made all kinds of mistakes, but he was no Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who I would say make far more and worse and more egregious mistakes. And I think you're raising a really important point. You're raising a point, which is that there's this false dichotomy. In fact, the new biography of Elon Musk falls into this category. I like Walter Isaacson's work a lot, but he falls prey to this in his biography of Elon Musk, which is there's this notion that we have to choose between being a total jerk but really competent or really nice but incompetent. And those are not our two choices. That's the whole point of radical candor is that there's this other way that works better and doesn't hurt people.

Lenny (01:07:13):
I think that's the key takeaway there is you can be even more successful if you lean into the care deeply. In theory, they could have gotten more out of their people if they made it clear they really care about them.

Kim Scott (01:07:26):
And there's plenty of counter examples of incredibly successful people who are very caring leaders, and it's not as much fun to tell stories about that. And so we don't as often.

Lenny (01:07:40):
Along the same lines, there's someone that you worked with that suggested I ask you about investing in your authentic leadership style, Melissa Tan. I don't know if you remember her.

Kim Scott (01:07:50):
Yes.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Okay, great. And she was on the podcast in the past, and she just said how when she met you, she was a very people-pleasery person and just wanted to be like, and you helped her develop her natural leadership style. Can you just talk about what you suggest to people to figure this out and how to find that for yourself?

Kim Scott (01:08:06):
I mean, I wonder what Melissa would say, but my memory of conversations with her, and this is an issue that I talk about a lot because a people pleaser too. I grew up in the South and I'm a woman. I was not brought up to challenge directly. That was not part of the culture that I was brought up in. I was brought up to be polite but also brought up to be kind. And for me, the thing that is most important to hang on to is that fundamental kindness and to realize that it's actually unkind not to say the thing. And so that is part of the reason why I encourage people. I tell the Bob story so often and I encourage other leaders who I work with to think about what their Bob story is that you realize it's not nice in the long run.

(01:09:00):
It's unkind in the long run, not to tell someone if they're making a mistake. There's nothing nice about that in the long run. And so that I think at least for me, that's been helpful. And then another thing that is helpful is again, to get others focused, to focus not on pleasing people, but on doing the right thing for those people, on truly caring about those people more than you care about your own discomfort in the moment. And that is something that is easier for people to do than just to challenge directly. I think in many ways it's about what is getting in the way. That's why I call it ruinism. Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes empathy can paralyze at least me because I'm so acutely aware of how what I'm going to say might impact the other person, might hurt their feelings that I don't say it.

(01:10:01):
And so when I push myself to be, and you can call it compassionate candor if you like that better than radical candor. But when I push myself not to feel so acutely what I think the other person might feel, and by the way, I could be wrong about what I think the other person might often, they're like, it's no big deal. They're like, oh, thank you for letting me know. But when I can let go of that and think about the other person and what I care about and what they care about for their future, going back to your point, if you know that it's really important for someone to get promoted and they won't get promoted if they keep talking to people in a particular way, then you're focused on what they want. That is really helpful to move past that.

Lenny (01:10:47):
Just a few more questions before we wrap up. Your book sold something like half a million copies.

Kim Scott (01:10:47):
A million now.

Lenny (01:11:00):
A million copies.

Kim Scott (01:11:00):
Million copies. Million in 23 languages. Yes.

Lenny (01:11:00):
23 languages. I had a stat of 20 languages. Jesus Christ. So a lot of people have read it, a lot of people have been using it. What's something that people often just get wrong that super frustrates you about the system, the recommendations that you just wish people come on, here's what I really wanted to say, or here's what you should change.

Kim Scott (01:11:17):
There's two things. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, when you write about a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it. One is this, in the spirit of Radical Candor and then the person acts like a jerk. That is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That is the spirit of obnoxious aggression. But shortly after the book came out, I was giving a talk at a tech company in San Francisco and I got some feedback from the CEO of that company that was so impactful that it caused me to write my next book, which is called Radical Respect. And in many ways, Radical Respect is kind of the prequel to Radical Candor because if you don't respect the other person, it's impossible to care about them and you're not going to bother challenging them directly. So what happened in this meeting? I walked in, I was really excited to give this talk.

(01:12:04):
The CEO had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade. She's a person I like and respect enormously, and she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech or in any other sector. And when I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, "Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's really going to help me build the kind of career I want." But she said, "I got to tell you, it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you." And she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would offer folks even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true as soon as she said it, and I knew how unfair it was because she's like one of the most even keeled, cheerful people I've ever worked with.

(01:12:49):
And I realized a bunch of things at the same time when she told me that, the first was that I had not been the kind of colleague that I aspire to be, that I imagined myself to be. I had failed even to notice the extent to which she had to show up unfailingly, cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together even though she had what to be ticked off about as we all do at work. So I had failed to be an upstander, a good colleague. The second thing I realized was that I had also failed to acknowledge when I was experiencing different versions of bias, prejudice and bullying. And I think part of the reason it's kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit she was in denial. But I had been in denial about a bunch of experiences I had had in the workplace.

(01:13:41):
I had pretended that a whole host of things were not happening, that were in fact happening. And I think part of the reason why I did that was that I never wanted to think of myself as a victim, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim did I want to think of myself as the culprit. So I'd been even more deeply in denial about the times that I had said or done things that hurt other people who I worked with, said or done things that were biased or worse. I had bullied people before. And by the way, when you become a leader, you're much more prone to bullying even if you don't think of yourself as a bully, which I certainly don't think of myself as a bully, but that doesn't mean I never bullied anyone. And then the last thing I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating these BS free zones, but I had allowed all manner of BS to pass. So that was what prompted me to write the next book, Radical Respect, which you can pre-order right now and please do.

Lenny (01:14:41):
That was my next question. Talk more about this book. What is it about? Where people find it?

Kim Scott (01:14:46):
Radical Respect comes out in May. You can pre-order it now. Anywhere you buy books, at your local independent bookstore, I'm speaking at a conference of independent bookstore owners soon you can pre-order it on Amazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere else you buy buy books.

Lenny (01:15:05):
And who would you say it's most for?

Kim Scott (01:15:08):
So there are chapters in that book about things leaders can do. There are chapters in the book about things you can do if you're harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying. There are chapters in the book about how to be a great upstander, how to be a better colleague, and there are chapters in the book about how to become part of the solution, not part of the problem when you're the culprit. And I think we all find ourselves in all four of those roles at different moments in time, and I don't think there's any one group who can solve this problem. Everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment.

Lenny (01:15:48):
Awesome. We'll link to that in the show notes.

Kim Scott (01:15:50):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:15:51):
To leave people with a very tactical next step. What's one thing they could do this week today to get better at Radical Candor, to start building that muscle?

Kim Scott (01:16:00):
I would love it if everyone would write down their go-to question what are the words that will come out of your mouth and practice it. Practice it in front of the mirror and then practice it with a friend and refine it. Just figure out what, because it is uncomfortable to solicit feedback from others. They don't want to give it to you and you don't really want to hear it. So if everybody can write down their go-to question and then put five minutes in your calendar of someone you're going to ask that question of.

Lenny (01:16:31):
And that calendar entry, I was going to come back to it actually. So you do the one-on-one agenda, adding the question, the calendar entry is for people you don't have a one-on-one with, pick someone that you're going to ask that you're not meeting with regularly.

Kim Scott (01:16:42):
Absolutely. Or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda. That's fair too. Either one.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Amazing. Kim, is there anything else you want to leave folks with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kim Scott (01:16:52):
I think just remember, you do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person.

Lenny (01:17:00):
Oh, I love that. Amazing. Okay, well with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kim Scott (01:17:07):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:17:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? You've already mentioned a few but what do you want to share?

Kim Scott (01:17:14):
Yes, I've mentioned a couple. Please do buy Radical Respect, I believe that the more novels people read, the better. People often ask me, what can I do to move up on the care personally dimension of Radical Candor and read more novels? This is the best way I know of to build compassion for other people, to understand the emotional signals that might be coming at you. I mean, some of my favorite novels are Middlemarch. I try to reread that all the time. Anything that Toni Morrison wrote, the Bluest Eye is one of my favorite, but also Song of Solomon. It just such a brilliant writer and will help you enter into the lives of people that you haven't entered into. I think that Orlando by Virginia Woolf is another one of my favorites. And Robertson Davies, the Deptford Trilogy is an incredible set of novels to read. I'm cheating now and giving you three.

Lenny (01:18:27):
The more the merrier.

Kim Scott (01:18:27):
Yes, Alice Walker, the Color Purple is another one of my very favorite books, so I recommend reading more novels.

Lenny (01:18:34):
I love this leaning into fiction that doesn't come up often on this podcast, so this is great. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kim Scott (01:18:47):
I watched all 19 seasons of Grey's Anatomy with my daughter during and after COVID. That was really fun.

Lenny (01:18:55):
Actually. I did the same thing with my wife. We didn't do all the seasons, but we watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy.

Kim Scott (01:18:59):
We watched every single one. It's still coming out.

Lenny (01:19:04):
Yeah, it's funny to see which characters continue and which I die off, leave.

Kim Scott (01:19:07):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:19:09):
Oh man. Okay. Funny

Kim Scott (01:19:10):
And Shonda Rhimes, I mean, watch her TED Talk, amazing person.

Lenny (01:19:14):
All right, we'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people that might be helpful to folks interviewing?

Kim Scott (01:19:22):
The question that I like to ask is just tell me the story of your career. And I know that's kind of, maybe it's a hard, it seems like a softball, but it's actually can be unfairly hard or not. I don't know, unfairly hard, but I always learn a lot about people from how they tell the story of their life and their career. And then what I try to do is they'll say a couple of things that really interest me and I sort of double-click down into the details of a couple of aspects. I love people's life stories, so that makes it a more fun conversation for me. Often people like talking about themselves so it's not too painful for them, but you also learn all kinds of unexpected things.

Lenny (01:20:13):
And is there anything you're looking for in an answer that's like, this is a good person to hire or is it mostly information? I'm just gathering a lot of background.

Kim Scott (01:20:22):
I find that I learn how the person approaches setbacks from a story, from the way they tell a story. I learn whether a person is able to identify mistakes they made. I mean, if you say, "Tell me the story of your career," if there's not a couple of mistakes in there, I also find that when they talk about accomplishments and then I double click on it, I learn a lot about what a person really did. Sometimes a person will claim credit for something that just happened that they had very little to actually to do with, and I learn about very often. I find that a good way to learn about people's skills and depth of knowledge.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kim Scott (01:21:14):
Yes. I love my new it's called Attitude, and they're shampoo bars and conditioner bars, so it comes in cardboard, wrapped in paper. There's no plastic. It's much more environmentally friendly, and I have long hair. It gets very tingly and the conditioner works, so I recommend.

Lenny (01:21:35):
Very unique suggestion. Is there a favorite motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, find useful to come back to in work or in life?

Kim Scott (01:21:46):
"It's not mean. It's clear." This is something someone told me on the streets of Manhattan. It's actually the origin story of Radical Candor. I was walking my dog, almost got hit by a cab, and this man, a perfect stranger, looked at me and he said, "I can tell you love that dog." That was all he had to do to move up on the care personally dimension, but he says, "You're going to kill that dog if you don't teach her to sit." And he pointed at the ground this kind of harsh gesture. He said, "Sit." The dog sat, had no idea she even knew what that meant. And I kind of looked up at him in amazement and he said, "It's not mean. It's clear." And then the light changed and he walked off leaving me with words to live by. So I think about that stranger all the time.

Lenny (01:22:30):
Such a good story. Final question. I read online that you started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow at some point in your life. Can you please explain this part of your life?

Kim Scott (01:22:41):
Yes. So I studied Russian literature in college, very practical major. And then I moved to what was then the Soviet Union in 1990 when I graduated from college, and I wound up taking a job with, first of all, I was with an investment company and then they pulled out of Russia and put the money in China. And so I wanted to stay in Russia and through a friend of a friend, I got a job working for this diamond company called Lazare Kaplan, new York-based diamond company, and they were trying to figure out what they should do in Russia. And I found out there was an opportunity to start this diamond cutting factory. And it was actually my first management job because I had to hire these diamond cutters and I had to hire them away from these Russian diamond cutting factories and I knew nothing about management or business or anything.

(01:23:44):
I'd studied Russian literature. I knew a lot about Dostoyevsky, so I thought it was going to be easy though. I was like, well, the ruble is collapsing. I'm going to pay them in dollars. Of course they'll come work for me. But they didn't take the job right away. To my surprise, they wanted to have a picnic. And at the picnic we brought a bottle of vodka, and there's a rule in Russia, if you open a bottle, you got to finish the bottle.

(01:24:07):
So by the end of the bottle of vodka, I realized that what I could offer that the state could not offer them was to give a damn about them. They wanted to know that I would be a manager who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways there. And as you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about, they were all men, about these men because I haven't been able to get them out. And I'm devastated by what Russia has done to Ukraine, but that was the moment when I realized that management really matters, and that to be good at it, you have to care about other people. And that was what made it interesting to me.

Lenny (01:24:53):
Man, that is a heavy first job as a manager.

Kim Scott (01:24:56):
Yeah. Yes, it was.

Lenny (01:24:58):
Wow, Kim, this was awesome. I think we're going to help a lot of people become better leaders. I think we're going to help a lot of companies change their culture. I'm so honored that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up and learn more about your stuff? And then two, how can listeners be helpful to you?

Kim Scott (01:25:18):
Radicalcandor.com is our website, and I'm not much on Twitter slash X anymore, but you can find us. We do a lot of posting on LinkedIn. I think that the thing that people can help me do is to send us a note. You can also email us radicalcandor@radicalcandor.com and let us know what could we do in podcasts like this or in our materials? What could we do that would make it easier for you to put these ideas into practice? Because Radical Candor is, it's about behavior change, and it sounds easy, but it's really hard, and we're always trying to figure out how to help people walk the talk here.

Lenny (01:26:02):
I think doing this podcast is going to make a dent in that goal.

Kim Scott (01:26:05):
Oh, good.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Kim, thank you so much for being here.

Kim Scott (01:26:08):
Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

Lenny (01:26:11):
Same. Bye everyone.

# Using behavioral science to improve your product | Kristen Berman (Irrational Labs)

## Transcript

Kristen Berman (00:00):
Economics says, "Look, people are rational. We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons." I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, "Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms." But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.

Lenny (00:45):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Kristen Berman. Kristen is the CEO and co-founder of Irrational Labs where she and her team use behavioral science to help companies like Google, Airbnb, PayPal, Microsoft, Fidelity, and TikTok build better and more successful products.

Lenny (01:15):
In our conversation, we cover a ton of real-life examples of product changes that have her and her team helped craft that led to significant impact at the companies. We talk about what biases and psychologies they find most commonly get in the way of people achieving what they want achieve in your product, her biggest surprises and insights about human psychology and how it relates to product design, a couple of real-life case studies including our work with TikTok and the change they made in the product as a result, and so much more. I found this conversation super fascinating and super tactical, and I can't wait for you to hear it. And so with that, I bring you Kristen Berman.

Lenny (01:55):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing in Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (02:02):
At least 40%.

Lenny (02:04):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (02:07):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (02:26):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (02:41):
Totally. It's credible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:50] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (03:54):
Kristen, welcome to the podcast.

Kristen Berman (03:57):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (03:58):
It's great to have you. You're on something called Irrational Labs, and so, to set a little context for folks, can you just talk about what it is you all do at Irrational Labs?

Kristen Berman (04:08):
Yeah, so Irrational Labs, we are a behavioral science consulting and design shop. So, we think about all things behavior change. We work on understanding psychologies that drive users, and then designing and testing ways to change behavior and drive engagement.

Kristen Berman (04:28):
I started it in 2013 with Dan Ariely, who's a famed behavioral economist. We started just working with a handful of companies, and now we have a team of 20 behavioral scientists working on behavior change across industries.

Lenny (04:43):
Can you talk about some of the companies that you've worked with, just to give us some examples? And then, what kind of stuff have you actually helped them with?

Kristen Berman (04:50):
We started a lot of our work at Google. We were actually embedded within Google for around three years. I even had a bus pass. And we started their behavioral economics team. We worked with over 25 teams from like self-driving cars to YouTube. And so, that was a big piece of the early work. And then recently, we've done work with TikTok where we've tried to... It actually accomplished decreasing misinformation share by 24%. We worked with one medical on how to increase setting doctor's appointments right away during the onboarding, and that worked and drove it up by 20%. We worked with Credit Karma on basically helping them increase set up for reoccurring deposits. We did that and increased it by 18%. So, basically a variety of ways to drive behavior change. Done stuff with Intuit, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and obviously, a variety of startups as well.

Lenny (05:45):
Wow. Okay, we're definitely going to talk about some of those examples. I'm super curious to hear what you did with TikTok, big company and story these days. Before we get to that, what exactly is behavioral design, and can you just define this space for us?

Kristen Berman (06:00):
Let's start with what is behavioral economics? So, basically, behavioral economics is a reaction to economics. So, economics says, "Look, people are rational. We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons." I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, "Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms." But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.

Lenny (06:51):
What are some of the biggest surprises, or maybe unintuitive results that you've come across working with companies using these insights in behavioral design, behavioral economics?

Kristen Berman (07:02):
Yeah, great question. One story that recently happened is actually a surprise that happened to the client. The partner was shocked. It actually didn't surprise us. And so, this was with a popular FinTech app and their most requested feature was budgeting. So, it came through all the support forums, interviews, felt like a table stakes feature; people wanted budgeting. And so, if you're the PM there, you're probably like, "You may talk to a few other users. You may get some confirmation, but you're likely building budgeting." And that's really where they were when we came and started working with them. We couldn't move them in another direction, but we did convince them to do an experiment. So, we convinced them to test, and there was three conditions. One was the control, which is just telling people how much they spend, and the other two were variations on budgeting. So, two different ways to do budgeting.

Kristen Berman (07:57):
So, big experiment. This is with 10,000 people, so we can really trust the results. And what happened? Nothing. So, they were shocked. The team was shocked. Remember, this is a big investment of time and effort, took a lot of energy to build. Zero change in average spend, zero change in spend variability. And so, the question is: Why weren't we surprised? Why were they surprised? The thinking here is if you map out every single step that it takes to do this behavior, and the behavior would be reducing your spend, it's pretty clear that budgeting just isn't going to pull the weight. And this is what we call a behavioral diagnosis, where you map out every single step. So, you'd have to know what your budget is. You'd have to know where in the month you are. You'd have to make a plan to do it. You then have to do it multiple times during the month. Incredibly difficult to do this one behavior. And once you do that behavioral diagnosis and you map out... We try to understand what people actually do versus what they say they will do. And by doing that, it becomes wildly clear that we should all be skeptical that budgeting would actually work to change the behavior that you're trying to get to.

Lenny (09:03):
Yeah, I'm also not surprised that didn't have a big impact. I have so many apps with budgeting features and I've tried many times to use them and it never sticks. It's like, "Eh, I'm just going to..." It's too much work.

Kristen Berman (09:15):
It's way too much work. And so, sometimes, any kind of work that we put on the user, we should be skeptical. We have to really prove that it's worth their time, and then measure if they actually do it.

Lenny (09:26):
Is there a better approach to that specific problem that you've found, or is that too broad of a question?

Kristen Berman (09:33):
The first line of defense in any problem solving would be, how would you make it easier for somebody to do? And so, in the personal finance world, really, the answer to most things is just default. So, it worked for automatic enrollment 401(k). The reason we have retirement savings in America is because people are defaulted into saving from their paycheck. So, that would be first line of defense. Obviously, difficult for product teams to execute on, takes a lot of backend infrastructure. So, if we were just solving the personal financial management stuff of like a budgeting alternative, we'd actually go to making it not just logistically easier, but cognitively easier. So, we call them rules of thumb; instead of having to decide in the moment, do I do this thing? And you're weighing the pros and cons. It's kind of typical econ, like, how much is this $3 worth to me? You'd actually make a rule of thumb that says, "Do I do it, or not?" So, instead of deciding, do you take a Lyft when you're coming home from work, you'd have a rule of thumb that says, "I don't take Lyft on the weekdays. I take it on the weekends." Very simple now to actually make this kind of decision. It's a heuristic . It's not going to be perfect, but it's going to help you reduce your spend in an easier way, at least, in a way that you'd stayed adherent to.

Lenny (10:46):
It reminds me a bit of James Clears' idea of creating this identity for yourself where he is like, "If you're like, 'I am a person that doesn't take Lyft on the weekdays', that becomes kind of this identity component and that makes it easier for you not to do that." Is that related?

Kristen Berman (11:00):
Yeah, basically. Sometimes, we think behavior change is driven by our attitudes, our preferences like, "I really want to be a runner" or "I really like this thing." But in reality, our behavior is driven by what we do. So, in order to change behavior, you have to do something different. It's not enough to have a goal objective to do it. And I think, maybe that's the big annoying thing about the self-help industry. It kind of just tells you it's enough to have a goal. It's not enough. You actually need to redesign your environment to change your behavior.

Lenny (11:35):
Is there any other examples of big surprises or unintuitive results from work you've done?

Kristen Berman (11:40):
One big one is actually... And I'm sure people listening have worked on signup flows before. This is kind of a common question and challenge in product world. And the common thinking is, and most often correct, that if you reduce friction to the signup flow, your conversion will increase. This is kind of the law that we all live by. And yet, there is one example, one time, where this is just not true, that you can actually increase friction and increase conversion. So, actually Lenny, have I ever told you about my mother?

Lenny (12:12):
Nope.

Kristen Berman (12:13):
Okay. So, now you're thinking about my mother.

Lenny (12:16):
Oh.

Kristen Berman (12:16):
Before, you were not thinking about... There's nothing about my mother, but I just made you think about my mother by asking you a question.

Lenny (12:22):
Son of a gun.

Kristen Berman (12:23):
So, when you ask a question, you can insert an idea into someone's head, you can get them thinking about something different. And so, in a sign up flow, what would you want people to be thinking about? You probably want them to be thinking about the benefits that you offer. So, if you ask them a question they can think about the benefits, it's going to increase their motivation to get over the hump of the future friction you're going to put in front of them because now they understand the benefits. So, as an example, if you go to Apartment List, they ask you questions during the signup flow that's like: What kind of apartment do you want? Do you want a studio, or a one-bedroom, a five bedroom? Do you want a patio, a basement, a view? Now, all of a sudden, I'm thinking, I'm engaging with the benefit. I understand how much supply that they have. So, if you Stitch Fix, or... Actually, Trunk Club has come out and said they did this and it increased conversion by 133%.

Kristen Berman (13:16):
So, asking these questions can really drive conversion. We actually did something where we put a quiz on a partner's website. It's TytoCare which is basically a device that lets you remotely connect to a physician. It's a little bit hard to use, but we wanted to help people understand the device, and we asked them questions about their medical behavior, their frequency use of technology. And for people who completed a quiz, 53% of them went on to purchase versus 37% who didn't complete. So, these type of questions can have a real impact.

Lenny (13:51):
And so, very tactically, the idea here is you add a step to your flow that asks the user some question that isn't actually something you need an answer to, but may get them to be more excited by finishing. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (14:04):
Exactly, yeah. And I would say probably most teams can do this. You can replace the carousel. The carousel is something where it tells you the benefit, but we want people to actively engage with the benefit so that they're thinking about how you can improve and affect their lives.

Lenny (14:22):
So, you said it's worked a couple times. It probably isn't something that usually works. Is there experience like sometimes it may work, maybe worth trying, but usually probably won't work. Is that generally right?

Kristen Berman (14:32):
We want to remove the field that was like an open text fields where we're asking people an open-ended question and we improved conversion by 40% page over page. So, for sure, some questions are harder and you should not ask them. When questions are easier and it's a drop down multiple choice, this is when you should be trying it. But definitely, the recommendation is not to ask a hard question where people have to think about it.

Kristen Berman (14:58):
By the way, for the question that we did, that was open text, the folks on the team thought that it was an easy question. But most questions when you're asking people with an open text field, it's just not an easy question.

Lenny (15:10):
Right. I hate those open text fields. And then, just one last, because I imagine people listening to this are like, "Oh, maybe I should run this experiment." Is the general best practice to ask a question that gets you to think about something that motivates you by finishing? What's like the rough mental model there?

Kristen Berman (15:26):
I think each product, obviously, will be different. One example would be, if I'm a bill pay app, you could tell me that I could pay my bill once a week, every day, every month, I could time it, but a better approach would be to ask me, "Do you want us to pay your bills immediately, or every week, or every month?" And so, what you're doing there is engaging people in the setup and actually implicitly telling them, "We can pay your bills immediately." So, would think about combining those two is showing people the benefit, like, how fast you want us to pay your bills, which gets you to think about how fast they are, and the settings which is actually you're really doing something to help the app work.

Lenny (16:09):
Awesome. Before we dive even deeper into more examples, I wanted to zoom out for a moment and I'm curious just how did you even get into behavioral economics? You said you worked with Dan Ariely. How did all this come about?

Kristen Berman (16:22):
Yeah, great question. So, I met Dan around 2008 and if you don't know Dan Ariely, definitely worth a Google. And at that time, he had just written his first book, Predictably Irrational, and I was a product manager at Intuit working on QuickBooks online. So, first use, customer discovery, and really after reading the book, hearing the talk, it's just like this light bulb went off and it was like... I'm talking to five to 10 customers to inform a feature, a product, and trying to come up with some insight on human behavior. And yet, there's this whole field that studied this, that has papers in thinking and studies why we behave the way we do. And so, this was like, "Wow. I can't believe we're just missing out on it in the product community." And so, I started working with Dan. We started and now, 14 years later, it's what I do; bring behavioral insights to product teams.

Lenny (17:19):
And you said you were running an embedded team within Google to work on this sort of thing?

Kristen Berman (17:23):
Yeah. So, basically, Google... It was kind of our first mover in thinking about how important understanding behavioral science was to product and marketing development. And so, it was Dan and I in the beginning, and over the course of the three years we hired internal Googlers, we brought in more people on our team, and really were an internal consultant where we'd be pitched to other teams, work with them from start to end on a project. And now, Google has one of the bigger behavioral science teams that's out there.

Lenny (17:50):
Wow. Okay. So, you've worked with how many companies at this point, roughly?

Kristen Berman (17:56):
I'd say hundreds.

Lenny (17:58):
Hundreds, okay.

Kristen Berman (17:59):
I mean... Yeah, hundreds.

Lenny (17:59):
Okay. So, there's hundreds of companies. There's also, I imagine, hundreds of these kind of biases and heuristics and kind of behavioral expectations of people. I'm curious, out of the work that you've done, what are the most common biases, heuristics of people that you find most useful in improving product experiences in product design? What's kind of the handful that ends up being most useful?

Kristen Berman (18:21):
Totally. And there are so many mistakes that humans make and we can call them biases, heuristics. Our team uses psychologies. What are the psychologies that drive us? And so, to tackle this, our team basically has created a model of behavior change. We call the three Bs. And this summarizes the most important psychologies that drive user that are important to the product manager and the marketers. We've used this at Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, so all the companies that we work with, and they now use it. And so, the three B framework, first B is actually not a psychology, but it is the most important part of behavior change, and it should be obvious if you think about behavior change, behavioral economics, it is behavior. In order to change behavior, you have to pick a behavior that you want to change. So, companies are really good at outcomes, but just not as sharp at picking the behavior.

Kristen Berman (19:13):
When I say behavior, I mean action. The thing that you want someone to do. By the way, the only wrong answer here is log in. It's not about logging in, it's about what you do after you log in. And when we're consulting teams, it would be like... We need to get uncomfortably specific, we say. Just really specific in the behavior. So, example, if I'm Peloton PM and I'm working on the app, I would say something like, "Within seven days of somebody starting the app, they do two 10-minute workouts with two different instructors." Now, obviously that is wildly specific and you'd probably be very happy if they did one workout with one instructor, but the reality is if you don't define that behavior you're going to change. You can't actually define the psychologies that affect someone's decision making when doing that behavior. So, that's the first B.

Kristen Berman (20:01):
Second B, again, is probably pretty obvious and is very critical. It's just barriers. So, we need to reduce the barriers to doing the behavior. And there are two types of barriers we look at. One is logistical. So, this is just the stuff in our way; could be entering a credit card, could be any form field. And then, the second is cognitive. So, the cognitive barriers get in our way as well. These are things like uncertainty aversion. This is optimism bias, information aversion. These are the things that would prevent... Status quo, big one. It's just you do the same thing today that you did yesterday. Your job is-

Lenny (20:37):
Please. Can you talk about those three? Just through out there, just briefly. I'm curious about the specific biases while we're there.

Kristen Berman (20:42):
Yeah. So, uncertainty aversion, when something is uncertain or we're not... I'll give you an example of your Lyft. There's logistical friction which is wait time. But then, there's also this uncertainty of is it going to come on time? When is it going to come? And with this uncertainty, you're probably going to look for other options. You're going to open up Uber and say like, "Maybe it'll come faster." And so, when there is uncertainty in our life, we either look for other options, or we just don't make a decision at all. Right? This is, by the way, very big in healthcare where when you're very uncertain about something, you may not even go to the doctor, or you may just make the wrong decision.

Lenny (21:22):
Got it.

Kristen Berman (21:23):
And same with status quo effect where... Underlying status quo effect is this idea that we always take the path... Not always, but majority. You don't really say always when you're talking about human behavior. Human behavior is very complex. More often than not, we take the path of least resistant, that we do the thing that's easiest, and typically, the thing that's easiest is the thing that we've done yesterday and the day before. And so, when you're asking someone to do something different, which is what most product, especially startups, are trying to do, you actually have to increase their motivation or make it easier, reduce the barriers to get them to do that. And so, status quo effect is a big, big one that folks are fighting.

Lenny (22:02):
Awesome. Thanks for sharing those. Let's keep going.

Kristen Berman (22:05):
Cool. So, the third B is benefits. This is where you want to increase the... Not just benefits, but the immediate benefits of doing something. We are all present bias, which means we prioritize our present self over our future self, so there are plenty of reasons that somebody, your customer, your user should take an action, but you actually have to give them a reason to take an action today.

Kristen Berman (22:30):
So, as an example, if you're Asana, and if you're trying to get someone to log a task, the right thing for them to do is log the task because it's going to get their project done on time. You're going to have a collaborative and communicative team that you're going to want to be on. But one of the real reasons we may log a task is because of completion bias. We want to see the checkbox. We may log it because of social desirability bias where other people see that we're getting our work done. There's a notification that goes to my teammate when I complete something. So, these are the immediate benefits that we have to build into products and features to drive use.

Lenny (23:07):
Awesome. I definitely have completion bias. I love checking those freaking checkboxes. I know Asana is famous for that little unicorn confetti thing, right? For making you feel really good when you complete something.

Kristen Berman (23:17):
Yeah. I don't know how much emphasis to put on these kind of confetti stuff. I think the idea of being done is... That psychological understanding that you completed it, confetti or not, is very powerful.

Lenny (23:33):
I love confetti. Okay, so just to recap, there's the three Bs. Behavior, what is the behavior you're trying to change? And the way you described it sounds like the activation milestone. That's the way most companies think about that. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (23:46):
Yeah. I would say the activation milestone and the novel thing here is just getting really specific about this behavior, so much that if you're not arguing with your teammates, you're doing it wrong.

Lenny (23:59):
About which behavior and...

Kristen Berman (24:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (24:01):
... I imagine this often comes... Similarly to the activation kind of moment, it comes back... Working backwards from what is most likely to keep this person around long-term, kind of to keep them retained, right?

Kristen Berman (24:12):
Yeah, exactly. So, what correlates with retention and what provides an immediate value to them by doing this behavior.

Lenny (24:18):
Awesome. Okay. So, behavior, then barriers. How do you break down barriers, logistical and cognitive. And then, benefits. The point about being an immediate benefit is a really interesting one because, yeah, you may be like, "In a year from now I might earn some money, but I'm not going to do anything hard right now if I'm not going to make any money right now."

Kristen Berman (24:36):
Exactly. And so, this is a tough one because we want to believe that people really do and use our products for the end benefit, but we really need to give people the reason to do it today.

Lenny (24:47):
Awesome. I want to dive into a of couple case studies of companies that I know you've worked with. Maybe before that, I thought it'd be good to ask this question about the dark side of this stuff. I imagine people often worry about, "Hey, are you just tricking people into doing things they don't want to do? That's not good." How do you think about that line?

Kristen Berman (25:06):
Yeah, it's a great question. I think, the answer to this really, with many things in life, comes down to incentives. So, what are the incentives of the product teams, of you, your manager, the team, working on this? I like to say we are what we measure, and it really matters what you measure. I'll give you a personal example.

Lenny (25:27):
Yeah.

Kristen Berman (25:28):
LendingClub, a while ago, hired me to increase their conversion flow for borrowers. They're a lending app and they wanted to get more borrowers in the flow. The novel thing here was that they would pay me a lot of money if I hit a bump. It was like a five-point bump and zero if I didn't hit anything. [inaudible 00:25:47]

Lenny (25:47):
That was that. That's your incentive structure.

Kristen Berman (25:50):
Right. So, my incentive structure was to increase the conversion flow, and over the course of working with them, I became a predatory lender. I was suggesting things that the legal team was like, "No, Kristen, of course you cannot do that." Setting some contacts, I was at that time leading a Duke University lab called Common Sense Lab. It was focused on low to moderate income Americans thinking about their financial health, building savings apps for them. So, here I am, this kind of do good, non-profit, very focused on financial health of Americans, and my other hat was predatory lender for LendingClub. And so, it's really about the incentives that we're giving ourselves and our team that will drive how anything is used. Much less behavioral economics of these tactics, but generally, the success of your team.

Lenny (26:46):
You may not have a clear answer to this, but any advice for setting those incentives correctly? Anything you've seen work well?

Kristen Berman (26:52):
Yeah. I think for us there's two tips. One would be to set the incentive on the behavior because the behavior is going to align more with the customer outcomes than the active use or the retention. And of course... And I'm not suggesting we don't measure active use and retention in these things, you should definitely measure them, but setting the incentive, and the KPI, and the product, and the marketing team on the behavior is going to result in a more customer-friendly product and outcome.

Kristen Berman (27:18):
And then, second would be increasing the duration of the incentive. So, if you're trying to hit a quarterly outcome, you're likely going to do things that will impact the short term to give that a bump. If you're trying to hit an annual or even longer outcome, you're going to be looking out for the best interest of the company and the consumers in a little bit different way.

Lenny (27:39):
Awesome. For the LendingClub example, what did you end up doing in the end, by the way? Did she just like, "Nah, let's not do this."

Kristen Berman (27:44):
I can't actually reveal the intervention that we did, but I did miss it. So, there was a five... Wait, by the way, point, not percentage bump, which is a lot, and we got 4.5. So, we almost hit it, but it's a clip, it doesn't work that way.

Lenny (27:59):
Almost sold your soul for that bump, and you didn't get there.

Kristen Berman (28:02):
I know.

Lenny (28:02):
It seems like [inaudible 00:28:03]

Kristen Berman (28:02):
It was a good lesson in incentive [inaudible 00:28:05]. And by the way, at that point, LendingClub was offering good rates to borrowers. There was efficacy in the idea of it, which is LendingClub lending to people who have lower FIGO and with better rate. And yet, you still want to have... You don't want to become the predatory lender in that situation.

Lenny (28:23):
Okay, awesome.

Lenny (29:15):
So, there's two companies that you worked with that I use, and I'm curious what you did for them and how you worked with them. One is TikTok, and then the other's One Medical. It'd be cool to just hear what you did for them, what they wanted your help with, and then just kind of what you took away, how it went, all that.

Kristen Berman (29:32):
Great, yeah. So, TikTok is obviously a big platform, and with any big social media platform, they have misinformation on it. This is not just a problem with TikTok. Facebook and Twitter have it, and misinformation is growing. And so, they asked us to help decrease the spread of misinformation on their platform.

Kristen Berman (29:51):
There's lots of ways that we could take that, and the first thing that we did, as we kind of do with any company, is think about what is the behavior that you want to change. And so, we narrowed on decreasing shares. So, we could have said likes. We could have said comments, or general engagement which is a broad thing, but we narrowed on decreasing the shares. So, when you're actually going to see a misinformation video, we want to decrease the number of people that share it.

Kristen Berman (30:18):
So, that was the first step. The second step is, this three B model, how do we think about the barriers? With TikTok, the thing that you want to do is get people to do something less. When you want to get somebody to do something more, you make it easier. When you want someone to do something less, you make it...

Lenny (30:36):
Put up barriers.

Kristen Berman (30:38):
Put up barriers, yeah. Actually, a nice example of it's an elevator study where basically, you want people to use the stairs. And so, what the researchers did was make the elevator door close 16 seconds longer. So now, you get in the elevator, you're annoyed. It's harder to use the elevator, and people went to the stairs.

Lenny (30:55):
16 seconds, interesting number.

Kristen Berman (30:57):
16 sec... We can't wait 16. And then, it's actually kind of long, though. You're standing there [inaudible 00:31:02].

Lenny (31:01):
So long. I'd use the stairs, yeah.

Kristen Berman (31:03):
Yeah. And so, that's kind of what we did for TikTok, which is, basically, you're in a very hot state. TikTok is a very fast platform, and so we just slowed people down. Two things. There was a label on the video, which is kind of classic in the misinformation world where you tell users that it's unverified information. And the second thing was, once you click the share button, we popped up something that said, "Are you sure?" And this was basically slowing people down. So, logistical friction, and actually cognitive friction because we're asking people to reconsider a prior decision and question their self. And so with that, both those things, the label on the video and the popup, reduced shares by 24%.

Lenny (31:42):
Wow.

Kristen Berman (31:43):
And these are tactics that Facebook and Twitter are also using to slow people down. This was actually one of the first [inaudible 00:31:48] published studies that showed that this drove down misinformation.

Lenny (31:51):
Can you talk a bit about how you came to those two conclusions? I know you work really closely with the product team and there's this whole process you go through. How do you come up with these ideas? How many ideas did you test? Is there anything more you could share on that?

Kristen Berman (32:03):
Yeah. It's actually a pretty involved process. First, we did a literature review which is basically saying like, Look, we're not the first people to think about this. Let's talk to the expert and understand what has worked and what hasn't." So, with that, actually, one of the insights was that reminding people about their value of accuracy. So, most people want to be accurate. Most people actually don't want to share this information. And so, if you can remind people at the point of sharing... By the way, it doesn't work if you remind people before or after. It's at the point of sharing, that this is unverified information, studies have shown that this could decrease share. So, we took that piece. We also took the hot and cold state literature that says, "If you actually don't want to get someone to do something, how do you intervene?

Kristen Berman (32:46):
So, we did this literature review. We came up with a hypothesis, and we had probably 30 different ways to implement this because the hypothesis is just a starting point. And then, we put it into quantitative research. So, we actually put five different version of the popup in front of over a thousand users, which... We got users from Prolific, which is a platform where you can easily test things.

Lenny (33:09):
Prolific? Cool. I haven't heard that.

Kristen Berman (33:11):
We didn't measure the idea, "Do people like this?" We measured a condition against another condition. So, relatively, what condition is more likely to work than the other condition, and that would increase our intuition than it would work in market. We're not saying that studies outside of the product are end-all be-all, but it's going to drive our intuition up a lot more.

Lenny (33:34):
For the research that you did, I imagine that's a lot of the value that you and your team bring to a group. For folks that are just on their own maybe, is there any advice for how to find research on problems you're trying to solve?

Kristen Berman (33:46):
Yeah. I would say, basically, if you're looking at a new problem, it's very tempting to talk to [inaudible 00:33:53] users in the beginning. We would basically say, "Look, go spend a day on the internet googling to see what else has been done." Google Scholar is a great place to start. Hot tips would just be making sure you're searching the right keyword. So, if you're looking at something in healthcare, you'd want to know what are the buzz words for chronic care and things that would actually drive you to a meta-analysis that would summarize what's already been done. So, Google Scholar, a great place to start. And then, coming up with the hypothesis and putting them to test. We never do a UX study where we're just showing people one thing because they could really like it or hate it, but they could really like or hate all the designs. We have no idea. So, when we're doing this, we always present multiple options, and then relatively look for which one is going to drive the behavior we're intending to change.

Lenny (34:44):
Is there a reason you did UX-oriented test versus testing the product? Is it just because they weren't ready to build an experiment in product yet?

Kristen Berman (34:52):
Yeah. We actually only got two conditions in product, which for us is we would like more and it was... We don't know if we're going to get a second bat at this. So, we said, "Well, two conditions plus the control." But what should those two conditions be? So, for us, we want to de-risk the launch as much as possible.

Lenny (35:11):
Awesome. And is that feature in the product today?

Kristen Berman (35:13):
It is.

Lenny (35:14):
Amazing.

Kristen Berman (35:14):
Yes, it is in the product, and they've done more global launches as well.

Lenny (35:19):
Sweet. I am clearly not sharing misinformation because I haven't seen it yet.

Kristen Berman (35:26):
You may not be searching the right thing. If you search medical, COVID, politics, you may get it.

Lenny (35:32):
Oh, boy. Here comes the decline of me. Okay. So, next case study that I thought would be fun to talk about is One Medical which I'm a happy customer of. What did you do with them?

Kristen Berman (35:44):
Yeah. Basically, One Medical asked us to increase engagement. This is a classic question. How do you increase engagement in a product or service, right?

Lenny (35:54):
Engagement, meaning just using it more often?

Kristen Berman (35:56):
Right, exactly. That's the real question, what does engagement mean? Actually, a have fun exercise that people could do with their teams is if you ask everyone on the team what engagement means separately, you can compare answers and most likely, people are saying different things. And if you guys can't agree internally on what to do or what engagement means, it's very difficult to build a product by which your users understand what to do.

Lenny (36:19):
Yup.

Kristen Berman (36:20):
Yeah. So, after lots of debate, we came up with a key behavior to target. Basically, somebody setting up a doctor's appointment right after signing up for One Medical. This is really important because more likely than not, you're going to sign up for One Medical, six months later, you're going to get a fever and get sick, and are you going to remember this app that you signed up for six months ago? Probably not.

Kristen Berman (36:44):
You're going to do the same thing you did before, which is call the doctor that you've normally gone to. So, really important for One Medical upfront, during onboarding, to set the mental model of what they can be used for in going to that doctor's appointment. Then, we looked to the barriers. One of the barriers, like, who is going to be your provider, your doctor. Picking somebody is hard. Finding an appointment time is hard. We're all busy people. How are you going to fit it in? Knowing actually what One Medical can help you with, also difficult. Like, what is this company thing and what should I go to them for? And then, the benefits. What are the benefits? And the benefits for using One Medical is you get your questions answered immediately. It's very simple, but you can really get your health questions and issues addressed. And so, the simple intervention we did was, just during onboarding, we asked people a few questions about their health; mental, sleep, physical. We then recommended a provider. So, instead of having lots of choice, we decreased the choice, recommended them one provider, told them why, and then recommended appointment times. And limited the amount of appointment times. It was for tomorrow. We recommended a virtual appointment so it'd be a quick thing that you could do from your home. And then, that intervention, the onboarding intervention, increased bookings by 20% during onboarding.

Lenny (38:06):
Of appointments?

Kristen Berman (38:07):
Of appointments, yeah.

Lenny (38:08):
With this-

Kristen Berman (38:11):
Onboarding. I don't know if I went through that when I joined One Medical.

Kristen Berman (38:13):
This is recent.

Lenny (38:14):
Okay, cool. Yeah. By the way, One Medical's awesome. As you're talking, I'm thinking if you could think about what are the five most commonly successful changes to a flow. One right now you just shared was reducing options, which is interesting.

Kristen Berman (38:31):
Yep.

Lenny (38:31):
And then, another you mentioned earlier is just reminding you of maybe what you're going to get out of it at the end. I don't know. Is there anything that comes to mind of here's a subset of things that seems to often work when you're trying to improve, say, activation or conversion of a flow?

Kristen Berman (38:46):
I would caveat all this with behavior is contextual. Why we are religious about testing is because it's hard to drag and drop from different contents. So, I'd caveat with that. And of course, there are some rules of thumb. So, one thing, really, is about showing people the benefit right away, really not under or overestimating that people understand the benefit of your app. So, how do you get them to experience it immediately? I would say that that's one.

Kristen Berman (39:17):
And then, the other is really just the reducing... I hate to sound so simplistic, but a lot of it is about making things easier logistically and cognitively, and making the benefit much more clear, salient. We say moving it from abstract to concrete. You really want to move something from the world of people can't really imagine how it would fit in their life to how does it actually fit in their life and keeping them going.

Kristen Berman (39:45):
If it's a long signup flow and people need to drop out, how do you send them reminders to pull them back in, and then when they are back in, land them on the spot that they were at. So, Wealthfront has said one of their key insights was when people dropped out of the flow, normally they would just put people back at the beginning. That's really frustrating. If you can put people back where they landed, they're more likely to continue.

Lenny (40:11):
That makes sense. Reduces barriers. I'm learning.

Kristen Berman (40:13):
Exactly.

Lenny (40:14):
So, there's two really interesting things you just said that I'd love to dive into a little bit. One is showing the benefit of something right away. Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you did that and it worked out really well? What's an example of showing a benefit?

Kristen Berman (40:30):
There's two ways to do benefits. One is the actual one that a consumer has. So, Asana and the collaborative communicator versus maybe one that's more immediate. When we're thinking about more immediate benefits, this could actually be things like social norms where you're telling people everybody else is doing something, and to them the benefit of doing this is following the herd. We all, by the way, don't like to think that we're part of the herd, but we all will succumb to this at some point in our lives.

Kristen Berman (41:00):
And so, one example is where we worked with a company called Study. This was a FinTech app and we're helping people to sign up or sync their bank account. Syncing their bank account is a required step in any kind of FinTech app, and yet so difficult, big drop off point. Just by reframing the choices of getting someone to think about completing a step versus the benefit that would come to them after... So, the benefit of syncing their bank account was actually huge. You'd get to see your income. You're really actually changing someone's financial picture by doing it, and they're signing up for it. They know it. But the small immediate benefit is how you're framing each step. Each step is going to give you the immediate benefit. So, for this one, it was a completion bias thing again where people are motivated to complete something. Sometimes we'll do an error message if it's really important for the app to work. And again, you shouldn't do that all the time, but if it's really important, the benefit is actually decreasing that error message on the screen. We call this Right for Wrong, doing the right thing for the wrong reason, where the right thing may be completing the flow, but the wrong reason is seeing that error message go away. Again, I would use that with caution. People will not use and love your app if you're putting error messages all over it.

Lenny (42:17):
That makes sense. I think you mentioned this. I haven't mentioned, but you wrote a guest post for my newsletter. It's one of the most read posts of the newsletter on just using...

Kristen Berman (42:25):
Cool.

Lenny (42:26):
... a lot of the... Yeah. I don't know if I told you that.

Kristen Berman (42:27):
Yeah. That's awesome.

Lenny (42:29):
And it's about using these insights to improve conversion in general. So, we'll link to that in the show notes. And I think, in that post, you mentioned this concept of Right for Wrong. It might be worth spending a little more time on this, just like what does that mean and what's an example that?

Kristen Berman (42:42):
When we think about Right For Wrong, we're helping people again do the right thing... So, this is a behavior that they want to do, but the reason is actually probably not related. So, if you think about just vaccines and what we saw here, the reason to get a vaccine is to help my neighbor and prevent them from getting sick. And yet, what happened? We gave people donut, give people free pot or marijuana. There were lottery tickets in Ohio. So, this is the Right for Wrong idea where you're really substituting... By the way, one of the bigger voting interventions is just having pizza show up at the poll line. You're motivating people to go vote not because they want to contribute to democracy, but because there's pizza in the poll line. So, at some level, we're pretty simple human where we want an immediate benefit. Clubhouse actually was an interesting example of this at some level where you saw two levels of status in Clubhouse. There were the people who were friends with the people on stage, and then there was everyone else. So, that was a motivator to be friends with more people and start following people so that you could be in that little bucket of friends with other people.

Kristen Berman (43:56):
So, we're giving people kind of some other reasons to do a thing that they may want to do, but they don't necessarily have the motivation to do it right away. If you think about Peloton, yes, I want to work out. Yes, I want to have a healthy person, but maybe I want to go to the class because the instructor making a shout out, or there's some streak that I'm trying to continue. So, their right for wrong here is the real reason to work out is to improve my physical health, but while I just want that instructor to give me a shout out.

Lenny (44:29):
So, the key there, just to kind of come back to the dark side of some of this stuff, is you want to make sure the end mean is good and right, whatever it is.

Kristen Berman (44:38):
Exactly, yeah. And so, again, all these things... The possibility of using anything for negative outcomes exist, and really it's about the incentives. It's what is your incentive to drive the customer benefit, and that's really where we say you have to be measuring the customer outcomes. You have to be focused on the customer outcomes.

Kristen Berman (44:58):
Some of the toughest teams we have understanding this are non-profits. We worked with one company a while ago. We tried to get them to add a deadline because they were trying to help people sign up for interviews. So, they were basically filtering people before Staples would get them for an interview. They'd do the interview prep. They'd help them show up for the interview. But the reality is that sometimes people miss this stuff. It takes a long time to get to the interview. And so, our push to them was to add a deadline to help people show up. Sometimes we say deadlines are a gift. You're just helping people kind of prioritize this. And they said, "No. Absolutely not. We cannot add a deadline. This is just too hurtful." And the reality is when you add deadlines, and we've done this in multiple companies, where you add a deadline, more people do the thing, right? Because you're helping kind of create the right for wrong reason, giving people the wrong reason to do the behavior that they actually want to do. We added a deadline to Kiva's flow for when their borrowers were signing up and we increased their conversion. So, obviously, you can use this in ways that are unintended and it really has some upside to help people.

Lenny (46:07):
I imagine you're building this just like toolbox of ideas that end up working often at flow. I know you said that you can't just copy and paste. Rarely is it just like, "Oh, this worked at 10 other companies, it'll probably work here." But that's kind of a cool thing that your team's probably doing just making this big list of here's 10, 20 things that we could start with these ideas and talk about them.

Kristen Berman (46:27):
Yeah. Once you understand the psychology of human behavior, you really start to understand and see patterns. We started with the idea that behavioral economics shows that people act in irrational ways, but we do it in predictable ways. And so, once you start understanding this, you can really start designing for the behavior change at this kind of predictable level.

Lenny (46:47):
For a product team that's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, we can't work with you guys right now. We can't afford it. We don't have time, just generally, but I want to think about this stuff and maybe implement it on my team." What would you suggest to say a PM leading a team that wants to implement some of these principles?

Kristen Berman (47:06):
Yeah. I would probably start from the process angle. We have the three B framework, which again, the most important step is defining the behavior. So, if you were to do a workshop with your team on what is the uncomfortably specific behavior that you want to change and you align everyone to this, it's going to be much easier for you to change that behavior because the psychology that drive that behavior will be a better conversation and more obvious.

Kristen Berman (47:31):
So, first in starting with the behavior, to get everyone in a room do a small workshop. The second would be the behavioral diagnosis. And this is the toolkit in behavioral science where we study not what people say they will do, but what they actually do. And so, the behavioral diagnosis, I'd say, it's like a journey map on steroids where you're really trying to map the steps that get people to the behavior change. And again, just doing this, teams have light bulbs. And this is one of the main things that we work with teams on; we help them do the behavioral diagnosis to have those light bulbs, and then we help diagnose and design the intervention.

Lenny (48:07):
Can you talk a bit more about this behavioral diagnosis step? What actually happens there?

Kristen Berman (48:11):
There's kind of two steps. One, you can outline the full high level flow where you're saying maybe there's 50 steps in getting to the behavior, and you can do this before they hit your product, too. But when we're working with just a very kind of... We want to help a team grow their product versus develop a new product, if it's just about growing and improving the current product, we'll do a deck of 200, 300 slides of screenshots where it's just very detailed analysis of the steps that it takes to get to the behavior change. And then, we overlay the psychologies that are driving people at each step. This actually takes a really long time, but the light bulbs of how you actually get to that beha... As I said, behavior change isn't easy. It's complex. It's hard. It's noisy. And so, you have to understand the steps that get you there before you're trying to change it.

Lenny (49:04):
Wow, that sounds really useful. So, you go through the product, make a screenshot of every little step, and then connect what barrier's keeping them from progressing. Is that roughly right?

Kristen Berman (49:15):
Exactly, yeah. So, maybe in a health app, it's information aversion. They don't actually want to see their test result. That's a step, and then we attach that psychology to that step and now we can have a brainstorm about, "Well, what would help decrease information aversion to get them over the next hump?"

Lenny (49:33):
What's cool about this is you could just... As a team, you have all these things you're trying to improve, all these flows and steps and things like that, and basically, these psychologies, as you call them, are useful to just anything you're trying to optimize. I imagine there's just like a list on Wikipedia of all these human psychologies and biases. I imagine a better way to learn about this is to take your course. So, maybe it's a good time to just chat about the course that you teach versus coming in house and working with the team. Can you talk a bit about that? Or are those the same thing?

Kristen Berman (50:02):
No, that's perfect. Yeah, so we have a... Thanks for the tee up, Lenny. Appreciate it. We have a bootcamp course, which basically is a self-paced online course that you can go in and understand. It has a lot of our case studies, many of them I didn't talk about here, and we walk you through the process. You'll have an intro call with us. There's a Slack group. There's office hours really trying to help people go through the process of behavioral design yourself, and it really brings these concepts to life and helps you apply them to your product. So, I think, starting with that bootcamp is a great place for designers, product managers, marketers, researchers to start. I can send you this. We have a Sweet 16, some of the 16 biases that we refer to most. The three Bs is an easy way to evaluate a product if you're just starting, but as you get deeper, these different psychologies will pop up.

Lenny (51:02):
Awesome. Please send that and we will link to it in the show notes. Just a couple more details in this course, how often do you run it? How long does it take generally for folks to take?

Kristen Berman (51:10):
Yeah. So, once a year we'll do a cohort course that's a little bit more in depth, but the best way is this kind of self-paced course. It's a eight-week course and we give you a month extra to go through it. There's 16 modules and there's homework throughout it that you can post in Slack and get feedback from behavioral scientists. So, a pretty interactive course, but you can go through it on your own and even share with your team. We do group things. We'll do like a team of 10, and then we can give you a private office hour where we just riff with you on your product challenges.

Lenny (51:46):
Awesome. And folks can find that at irrationallabs.com. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (51:49):
Yeah. Thanks again for this.

Lenny (51:50):
irrationallabs.

Kristen Berman (51:50):
Yeah, irrationallabs.com is the spot, and if you... Probably signing up for a newsletter is also... We publish all of our research there and other kind of fun behavioral insights.

Lenny (52:01):
Sweet. Well, with that, we've reached our exciting lightning round.

Lenny (52:05):
So, I'm just going to ask you a bunch of quick questions. Whatever comes to mind, fire away and we'll just go through them real fast. Sounds good?

Kristen Berman (52:11):
Great.

Lenny (52:12):
Okay, cool. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Kristen Berman (52:17):
I would be [inaudible 00:52:17] not to say Predictably Irrational. I think this is a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Influence is also a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Many times you read Influence and you change Your Career. It's a really powerful book. And then, the under-talked about one is [inaudible 00:52:35] author Robert Frank. He wrote Darwin Economy, and he talks more about kind of status, and social norms, and how this drives a lot of our behavior. So, I'd recommend Robert Frank as an author in Darwin Economy.

Lenny (52:48):
What's another favorite podcast other than the one you're currently on?

Kristen Berman (52:51):
Science of Change is my actual podcast, so a little self-promotion. We interview product leads and talk about what they've done in their product. And then, the other one is, No Stupid Question. This is by the Freakonomics. Stephen Dubner and Angela Duckworth come together and just answer questions about behavior change.

Lenny (53:11):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Kristen Berman (53:14):
I love The Rehearsal. This is-

Lenny (53:16):
I can see you loving it.

Kristen Berman (53:17):
Yeah. So, it's basically made me feel that it's rehearsing life. And I think, sports, it's so obvious you want to practice. I just started ping pong lessons actually, and I'm doing the same stroke for an hour. But in life, we don't rehearse as much. I don't write an email a hundred times, and then practice sending it. And so, I think there's probably an opportunity for us all to learn some lessons from that.

Lenny (53:42):
Have you seen Nathan For You, his other show?

Kristen Berman (53:44):
I have, yeah. The Rehearsal was just so compelling and I'm not usually somebody who watches media, so this was mind blowing. I loved it.

Lenny (53:52):
I actually like Nathan For You better.

Kristen Berman (53:54):
Oh, interesting. Okay.

Lenny (53:54):
Yeah.

Kristen Berman (53:54):
I'll give another...

Lenny (53:57):
What a weird show, but I love it. Okay, next. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Kristen Berman (54:03):
So, interview for... I'll take this as interviews for people when we're hiring. I would caveat to say, interviews, actually we know, don't predict job performance. So, very little to no evidence would say interviews will predict how I perform on the job.

Lenny (54:19):
Shush. Just kidding.

Kristen Berman (54:20):
We use skill assessments and trials as ways to predict job performance, but interviews are good at predicting affinity and culture fit. And so, if you want to ask a question about that, one of my favorite questions is just, what is a personality trait that defines you? So, really, one that you are filled with strength, but that also can be seen as something you're working to improve. So, for me, I may be confident, but that may mean that I'm not listening. And so, we have really strong personality. People are really quick at answering this question. They really know the thing that they do good but also could hurt them, and I find that it helps understand a person a little bit easier and faster.

Lenny (55:04):
Last question, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?

Kristen Berman (55:08):
I don't know if people will know him, but Chris York. He is a behavioral scientist, designer. I would go to Chris and ask him a question, and just accidentally, in the last year, had done full research on the question and has a very thoughtful answer. Chris York wins for me.

Lenny (55:32):
Amazing. Have not heard of him. We'll look him up. Kristen, thank you so much for being here. I feel like you're going to change a lot of people's behaviors. You're going to break barriers for a lot of products. And there'll be many benefits that come out of our chat. Thank you again for doing this.

Kristen Berman (55:47):
Wonderful. Thanks for having me, Lenny. This is super fun.

# What sets great teams apart | Lane Shackleton (CPO of Coda)

## Transcript

Lane Shackleton (00:00:00):
Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:55):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:02:41):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Calm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC2, ISO 27,001, GDPR, HIPAA and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders.

(00:04:04):
Lane, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lane Shackleton (00:04:07):
So glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:09):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?

Lane Shackleton (00:04:36):
Yeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.

Lenny (00:05:09):
Okay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:23):
It's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:28):
Amazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:42):
Yeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.

(00:06:48):
So I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.

Lenny (00:07:29):
Damn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?

Lane Shackleton (00:07:37):
One is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, "Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now." Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Yeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.

Lane Shackleton (00:09:11):
Pre kids. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Oh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?

Lane Shackleton (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.

(00:11:11):
And so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.

(00:11:49):
And then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Amazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?

Lane Shackleton (00:13:06):
When we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, "Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great." And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.

Lenny (00:14:11):
You said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?

Lane Shackleton (00:14:19):
We basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.

Lenny (00:15:52):
Super cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.

Lane Shackleton (00:16:08):
That's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.

Lenny (00:16:15):
Okay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:26):
We were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:38):
Maybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.

(00:17:41):
So the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, "Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh." And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.

(00:18:34):
But the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.

(00:19:49):
And to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.

Lenny (00:21:06):
There's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:22):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:22):
And Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:30):
Yep.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Have you read that?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Where it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:34):
Totally.

Lenny (00:21:34):
The other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable."

Lane Shackleton (00:21:48):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:49):
I feel like you just changed art-

Lane Shackleton (00:21:51):
Yeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Oh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:58):
Yeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-

Lenny (00:22:10):
Yeah. What is that lesson?

Lane Shackleton (00:22:11):
The way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:22:55):
I was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, "I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined." And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:41):
Yeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.

Lenny (00:23:45):
Tell me more.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:46):
The prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.

Lenny (00:24:05):
Okay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:21):
Just lane.substack.com.

Lenny (00:24:24):
Sweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:28):
I think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, "Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?" And I'm sitting there like, "Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals." And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-

Lenny (00:25:11):
What's the cathedral story?

Lane Shackleton (00:25:11):
It was quite clarifying.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Yeah. Do share.

Lane Shackleton (00:25:14):
Yeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there." You ask the second person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays." You ask the third person, "What are you doing?" And they say, "Well, we're building a cathedral." And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.

(00:26:22):
So very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.

Lenny (00:27:26):
Such a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Lane Shackleton (00:27:39):
Classic. Classic. It's Antoine.

Lenny (00:27:42):
That is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:06):
Probably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Are there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:53):
I mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.

Lane Shackleton (00:29:23):
It's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.

Lenny (00:29:58):
The other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, "Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie." Or, "They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems." That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.

Lane Shackleton (00:30:30):
Yeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.

Lenny (00:31:18):
The first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:24):
And the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.

Lenny (00:31:29):
Thanks man.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:29):
You've done something very special.

Lenny (00:31:31):
I appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?

Lane Shackleton (00:31:49):
Sure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit, I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:33:04):
That is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Lane Shackleton (00:33:26):
Nice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?

Lenny (00:33:31):
No. Say More.

Lane Shackleton (00:33:33):
It's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.

Lenny (00:34:08):
It's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.

Lane Shackleton (00:34:31):
Yeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.

Lenny (00:36:03):
What are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?

Lane Shackleton (00:36:10):
There are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?

Lenny (00:36:24):
No.

Lane Shackleton (00:36:27):
We've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.

(00:37:41):
And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.

Lenny (00:38:20):
That's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.

Lane Shackleton (00:38:25):
Yeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.

Lenny (00:38:45):
And how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?

Lane Shackleton (00:38:51):
The way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, "Oh man, we got to address all this feedback." Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.

Lenny (00:39:46):
What about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?

Lane Shackleton (00:39:50):
Oh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?

Lenny (00:39:57):
Amazing.

Lane Shackleton (00:39:58):
And making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.

Lenny (00:40:04):
I imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, "Oh, Lane told us to change this thing." I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.

Lane Shackleton (00:40:21):
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:22):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:41:21):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

(00:42:15):
Any other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?

Lane Shackleton (00:42:21):
I guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.

(00:43:25):
So if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, "Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.

(00:44:29):
And so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, "Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.

(00:45:28):
So a salesperson can say, "Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested." And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.

Lenny (00:46:45):
I love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, wow, this is extremely cool," how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?

Lane Shackleton (00:47:15):
Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.

Lenny (00:48:01):
Yeah. I was going to ask.

Lane Shackleton (00:48:02):
The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important." And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, "Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it." Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.

(00:49:03):
And so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, "This is cool. I've never done this before." Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.

Lenny (00:49:48):
Coda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?

Lane Shackleton (00:50:11):
People are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.

(00:51:06):
So I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision."

(00:52:10):
And it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, "I may have some opinions, but keep going." That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, "Just notify us of the decision after." And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, "Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later." So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.

Lenny (00:53:02):
It sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.

Lane Shackleton (00:53:17):
Tag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.

(00:54:11):
And so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, "Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind." And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.

Lenny (00:55:26):
Awesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?

Lane Shackleton (00:55:36):
One of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, "I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.

Lane Shackleton (00:57:09):
Yeah. I remember that.

Lenny (00:57:11):
Okay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:57:24):
Okay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:46):
Yeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, "Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views." And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.

(00:59:04):
And so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, "You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out." Essentially.

(00:59:49):
And I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.

(01:00:49):
And I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.

Lenny (01:01:23):
It makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.

Lane Shackleton (01:01:39):
Yes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.

Lenny (01:01:46):
You mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?

Lane Shackleton (01:02:13):
That was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.

(01:03:08):
So after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.

(01:04:29):
I think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, "Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store." Or, "I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service," or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.

(01:05:21):
And then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Coming back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.

Lane Shackleton (01:06:33):
Let's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.

Lenny (01:06:46):
At Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, "I need to become a PM immediately."

Lane Shackleton (01:06:55):
Totally.

Lenny (01:06:56):
I think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?

Lane Shackleton (01:07:24):
Yeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.

Lenny (01:08:47):
My lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, "Oh Lane, tell us more." And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.

Lane Shackleton (01:09:15):
That's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.

Lenny (01:09:41):
The other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, "Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home." So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.

Lane Shackleton (01:10:30):
I think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.

Lenny (01:10:53):
And one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?

Lane Shackleton (01:11:08):
Yeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.

(01:11:59):
I'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, "Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire." At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, "Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.

Lenny (01:13:15):
So funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:18):
No idea.

Lenny (01:13:19):
Hoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lane Shackleton (01:13:30):
Maybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.

Lenny (01:13:33):
Yeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:37):
Cool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.

(01:14:35):
And the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.

(01:15:31):
They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.

(01:16:30):
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.

(01:17:26):
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?

(01:18:13):
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.

Lenny (01:19:23):
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.

Lane Shackleton (01:19:31):
Great. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:32):
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?

Lane Shackleton (01:19:37):
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.

(01:20:43):
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.

Lenny (01:21:32):
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:46):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:21:47):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:51):
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.

Lenny (01:22:27):
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.

(01:22:43):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Lane Shackleton (01:22:48):
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.

Lenny (01:22:59):
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:01):
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.

Lenny (01:23:03):
Ooh. It's really good.

Lane Shackleton (01:23:05):
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.

Lenny (01:23:11):
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.

(01:23:18):
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:22):
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.

Lenny (01:23:49):
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:10):
Yeah. We-

Lenny (01:24:11):
Don't know if we screwed you.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:13):
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.

Lenny (01:24:20):
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?

Lane Shackleton (01:24:40):
I like that.

Lenny (01:24:42):
So feel free to steal it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:45):
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.

Lenny (01:25:13):
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?

Lane Shackleton (01:25:21):
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.

Lenny (01:25:57):
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.

Lane Shackleton (01:26:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:26:03):
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?

Lane Shackleton (01:26:16):
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:03):
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.

Lenny (01:27:28):
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:43):
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.

Lenny (01:28:24):
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lane Shackleton (01:28:42):
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:29:22):
Awesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.

Lane Shackleton (01:29:25):

# Lessons from one of the world’s top executive recruiters | Lauren Ipsen (Daversa Partners, GC)

## Transcript

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:00):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:00:35):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:01:05):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:01:15):
One of the most important skills for founders and senior product leaders to develop is the ability to hire great people. You won't be able to build the best company or the best product if you can't hire the best people. And Lauren is one of the most experienced and successful people in the world when it comes to hiring product leaders. She's placed over 80 senior product leaders across tech companies and has worked with some of the biggest companies out there. When I asked a bunch of really smart product leaders who their favorite product recruiter was, Lauren's name came up a ton.

Lenny (00:01:46):
In our conversation, we get super tactical about what founders need to do to find the best product talent, what product managers should be doing during their career to give themselves the most opportunity, and we also touch on what recruiters themselves often get wrong when trying to attract great talent. This episode is rich with actionable advice for basically everyone, and I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Lauren Ipsen.

Lenny (00:02:12):
Who has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you.

Lenny (00:02:57):
Snowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency.

Lenny (00:03:17):
Maybe you've thought about using Retool before but just haven't, and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at retool.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.

Lenny (00:03:53):
I actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovering research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks.

Lenny (00:04:24):
Want to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

Lenny (00:04:45):
Lauren, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lauren Ipsen (00:04:47):
Thanks so much. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
I've been meeting to do an episode on product hiring and recruiting product people for a while, and when I asked a bunch of smart friends who should I have on to talk about this stuff, your name came up a bunch, and so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:03):
Me too. Absolutely. I'm grateful that you asked.

Lenny (00:05:07):
So, to help listeners get a sense of just your background and kind of the journey you've been on to get to where you are now, can you just spend maybe just a minute kind of talking through the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're doing now?

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:19):
Yeah, absolutely. So I started my career in broadcast. I originally thought that I wanted to be on the news and quickly realized I didn't necessarily want to be the face of sadness. There's a ton of that happening in the world.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:36):
So, made a pivot pretty early on and thought, where could I use the communication skills that I've been working so hard on and do something that's impactful in a big way, but maybe just with a little bit of a different angle? And stumbled across executive search.

Lauren Ipsen (00:05:52):
Exec search is not really something that people major in college by any means or think they're going to end up doing. So it was something I found fascinating. I had applied to all of these different companies like Twitter and Snap and Pinterest, hadn't heard back from any of them, was a name in the resumes, and thought, well, how cool would it be if I could work with all of them and have an opportunity to play a part from a different lens?

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:18):
So, got into exec search, was really focused early on on consumer mobile build outs. Was doing a lot of work with Twitter and Reddit and TaskRabbit and Nextdoor, Postmates, you name it, and that was probably 85% of the work I was doing. And then as, on the agency side, 15% was obscure, autonomous helicopters selling into the Department of Defense and then retail and robotics, and it was all very fascinating, but for me, who has wicked bad ADD, it was amazing to be able to be so stimulated by so many different industries and feel like I couldn't really master this.

Lauren Ipsen (00:06:57):
So, long story short, had an awesome career at Daversa Partners, which is a boutique executive search firm, and thought I was going to be there potentially forever. Was tapped by a awesome individual, Abe Shafi, who was founding a company. I had been doing a lot of work for them. They were a client of mine at the time. Placed a couple great hires and they said, "We're either going to kick off a head of talent search with you or you can come over and join us." So I was the first recruiting hire over there, built out the talent function in its entirety.

Lauren Ipsen (00:07:27):
I definitely think there was a part of me that I loved the operating experience, learned a ton, worked side by side some amazing people, but was really missing working with founders, and lots of them, and keeping a pulse on the market. So General Catalyst tapped me most recently, and been working here for the past couple months, and it's been great thus far, and I'm specializing in our consumer and crypto investments.

Lenny (00:07:51):
Awesome. The fact that you're at GC now makes me think about another recruiter that I know who's awesome, Austin Brizendine, and it's interesting that a lot of the best recruiters seem to be heading to VC funds, and I'm curious why that is happening. Is it like a comp thing? Is it other things that are pulling everyone away into funds?

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:09):
It's a great question. It's definitely not a comp thing. I'll say that. I think it could be a stability of life thing. Search is incredibly volatile, and you have to hustle so hard, and as soon as you have three wins, you've got four more things to execute on. And so, there's aspects of it that can be tough, especially in a market like right now where you really do have to chase business and you can't be selective about what you take on, so you could be pitching things that maybe you don't necessarily believe in in its entirety or what have you. So, I think that's one component.

Lauren Ipsen (00:08:39):
In house is obviously difficult right now as well for talent leaders. It's really scary to take a bet on one single company right now and know what it's going to look like six months from now. And so I think those things combined might be the reason for an influx in folks leaning more towards venture, and I think it's just timeliness.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Got it. That makes sense. The downside is it's hard for people to find awesome recruiters because once you're in a fund, you're just going to help those startups. And so we're going to talk later about just how do people find awesome recruiters, what do you look for? But there's roughly three things I want to spend our time chatting through today. One is for founders and hiring managers, just how to find the best talent and what they could do to be successful finding the best talent. Two is for product leaders and PMs, how to give themselves the most opportunity from the flip side. And then third is just for recruiters, what do they often do wrong? How do they miss out on the best product talent? Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:37):
Yeah, that sounds great.

Lenny (00:09:39):
Okay, cool. So on the hiring front, just diving in, say you are a founder, you're someone really early at a company, and maybe you've got a couple PMs and you're starting to think about we need to hire a really senior product leader or first senior product leader.

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:52):
Sure.

Lenny (00:09:53):
What do you find is often the biggest mistake that founders make when they're trying to hire their first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:09:59):
I think especially for founders that haven't hired for this caliber of talent in the past, it's really easy to be distracted by shiny objects and look at huge names. You want to find the CPOs of Google and YouTube or what have you because that seems like it would be such an incredible opportunity for brand recognition. And to an extent, it is. But the fact of the matter is, oftentimes those individuals are pretty far from the work and have a great team of executors that they've put into place that are actually the ones that are in the weeds.

Lauren Ipsen (00:10:33):
And so I think that's the biggest mistake I see people make, especially on the hiring front where they have limited resources, and maybe they're an early stage company and trying so hard to bring in big names is not always the best way to go about it because the fact of the matter is they need to go then hire a team. So, I think looking for someone that's a little closer to the work, maybe someone that can step up into that type of role and do so in a way where some days they might actually be operating like a PM and then other days they might be able to build from a leadership perspective, that's more of the DNA that people should be targeting.

Lenny (00:11:09):
Do you think the source of the issue with that going wrong, that they no longer can do that work as well because they've been shielded away from the tactical day to day? Or is it that they're not as hungry as they used to be and they're just like, "I already, I'm a YouTube 10 year super success, I don't need to prove myself anymore," and they're just not as hungry, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:29):
I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say that all senior leaders aren't hungry. I think that there's some folks that really lean into the work in a different way and miss that, and often go to startups because they crave building.

Lauren Ipsen (00:11:41):
So it's not necessarily that, but I do tend to lean towards folks that have a chip on their shoulder or have something to prove and want to build a name for themselves. All of that to say, there's a reason that a lot of those people got to where they are, and some of the best talent are some of the senior folks, but just maybe not necessarily the best talent for where this company is today. Right? It could be great for 10 years down the road, but the past five years of that individual's career could have been far more focused on camaraderie, team building, operational components, performance reviews, and then aspects of product vision, which just might not be the innovative AB testing type of profile that you typically look for in these pre-IPO companies.

Lenny (00:12:27):
Got it. I imagine there are stories that you can share about people you've placed like that, that have not worked out. If you can share one, that'd be awesome. But maybe a side question is the general advice, just don't assume someone that's been successful at a big company with a fancy background is going to be great. Sometimes they work out, but not always, is that kind of the takeaway?

Lauren Ipsen (00:12:46):
Yeah. I would say the general advice is who is going to be best for this specific role at this specific time, not necessarily who is the best talent in the world or in the market. Those are two very, very different questions to ask. And I think early on in my recruiting career, I was often just trying to recruit these whales of executives to try and prove myself and say, "Oh, I got this person to entertain this opportunity, how sick is that?" But naturally, that's not necessarily the person that actually can move the needle. And so you need to think very specifically. Just because this is the best talent, that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best talent for this role today.

Lenny (00:13:25):
So to double down on that, say you are hiring and you know you're going to start hiring a senior product leader, what is it that you suggest founders nail down and iron out when they're kicking off the hiring process, either on their own or with a recruiter? Like, in the job description, what else do they have to get right to find the right person?

Lauren Ipsen (00:13:48):
It's a number of things, like product leaders can come in a lot of different flavors, and so I think it's trying to determine where this person should major and minor, where they should spike. Is this someone that's going to really lean into the design efforts? Is it someone that actually kind of needs to just operate like a very senior PM and continue to build out a team? Is this someone that really should be focused on product vision for the long haul? And then thinking more holistically about how to build the rest of the team.

Lauren Ipsen (00:14:12):
There's so many different ways in which you can hire for a product leader. So I think it's trying to work a little bit backwards and think about, what is the actual outcome that we are trying to solve for with this hire? Or are we just hiring a head of product because we feel like we need to hire a head of product? That's so often what I see is the board's telling me we need to hire a head of product and I don't necessarily think that we do, or I'm not exactly sure what we need in this role. And so whenever you're starting a search in that regard, it's kind of doomed from inception, so you need to get incredibly granular on the front end around, what is this person going to be coming in to do? What's their mandate? And if we think about someone that's just absolutely hitting it out of the park and crushing it, what does that look like? So I think just trying to be really specific on the front end.

Lenny (00:14:59):
I love that last piece, just what does success really look like for this person? On the first piece, that's exactly the same advice I give founders when they're looking for a PM is like, what do you concretely need them to do day to day? Not like, "We need someone to help us with product." And that often helps illuminate, okay, I see. We need someone to help us ship more consistently. We need someone to help us hire engineers. Yeah, just make a list. What are they going to do in the first month or two or three?

Lauren Ipsen (00:15:24):
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think those are the most important things. Like the 90 day plan is something that's overused but so necessary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So that component and then, okay, a year from now, what should this person be doing? Two years from now? Do we want them to grow up into a CPO role? Do we think about that in a different way? How are we thinking about the product direction today, 12 months from now, 18 months from now, through IPO? I think it's really difficult to think about things that way, and so often you're thinking about the task in front of you and just trying to iterate quickly, but that is the type of thought process that needs to be happening from the CEOs and founders.

Lenny (00:16:06):
Are there archetypes of PMs, if you just bucket like here's the three maybe most common types of product leaders that founders hire, because there's an infinite list of skills and things they could do, but just to make it even simpler, like here's probably one of these three you're looking for. Do you have something like that in your head?

Lauren Ipsen (00:16:25):
Yeah, there's platform product leaders or folks that are kind of more indexed on the infrastructure components. There's folks that are typically focused on core product, or consumer product if it's on the consumer side of things. And then you'll have folks that are really indexed and that can include UX individuals, design folks. And then there's also typically specialists, so individuals that are really hyper-focused on growth or monetization or what have you. Those are the three buckets that I would say I see most often.

Lenny (00:16:57):
Do you feel like founders sometimes pick one of the wrong buckets and that's a common mistake, or is it generally it's the wrong bucket but then maybe it's not the right spikes of skills within that bucket?

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:08):
Well, it's kind of twofold. I think sometimes people just bring in a head of product to do everything, so that's probably not the best way to go about things. I think that ends up being a unicorn, which you hear often in the search world, and it becomes really difficult to hone in on what good looks like.

Lauren Ipsen (00:17:25):
And so I think again, it just comes back to having a clear org chart on the front end and determining, are we hiring someone specifically to build out our walled garden ads approach, or are we hiring someone to run product marketing, or are we hiring someone to help from a product perspective to build a better core user experience? Those are all very, very, very different roles, and if you bring in one person to try and do it all, the facts of the matter is, they're going to have to bring in some key lieutenants to help them, so is that something you want to do or are you more focused on bringing in someone imminently to help on the ad side of things, and then we can find that head of product to help them out down the road?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:05):
That's kind of the way in which I would architect it and think about it, is what's most imminent, and what do you actually need to hire for today, as opposed to just hiring for the sake of hiring and bringing in that leader.

Lenny (00:18:17):
And part of the discussion there is maybe they grow up into this head of product long term, maybe not. Maybe we just need someone to ship the ads platform, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:24):
That's exactly right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:18:26):
You mentioned this title of head of product. There's also VP of product, CPO. There's all these titles and I feel like people sometimes use them interchangeably, don't know which one to use when they're putting out a job description. Do you have any kind of heuristic rule of thumb of just, here's how to think about when to use each of these titles? Or is it not even a big deal for, say, a founder, hiring the first senior product leader?

Lauren Ipsen (00:18:48):
It's a great question and it definitely leads to confusion across the board because I'll have candidates come to me and they'll say, "I'm only looking for a CPO role," when I'm working with a startup where, maybe on the venture side of things, we've actually advised that startup to not hire C-level executives at this point. And so that naturally could eliminate a candidate that could be amazing for the role.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:15):
Similarly, people could feel that way if it's a VP of product role, but that in their mind is the most senior product leader within the organization running everything from end to end who they intend to be the CPO down the road but are not in a position where they're ready to hire C-level execs. So, it's tough, and it really depends on the organization and the way in which they're thinking about org charts and leveling.

Lauren Ipsen (00:19:39):
A lot of startups at this point are almost allergic to C titles or VP titles or are just more title agnostic than I've seen in the past, so you see a lot more of these head ofs, and that is sector leaders, up until probably C plus or D stage. And then you get to D and E, and you'll see more of the VP, director, CPO type. And I think that is the way that people should be thinking about it is, if I'm joining a company very, very early days and it's called head of engineering, that is intended to be the most senior engineering leader within the organization.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:19):
The fact of the matter though is there's good reason sometimes why they're not throwing out that C title, and could this person be layered down the road? Potentially, because maybe the talent they need right now is different than, just as we had spoken to earlier, is different than the talent that they might need from a massive CPO in two and a half years.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:37):
And so I think that rubs people the wrong way because they want a bit of a promise that things are going to, if they join at this stage, that they'll be in it for the long haul and be that chief product officer that takes a company through an IPO. But companies are so dynamic and things change so quickly.

Lauren Ipsen (00:20:52):
So, I guess a long-winded way of me saying there's different breadth and depth to each role, but I think for the most part, unless it's a very siloed company with multiple different VPs, if you're coming into a company and they say this is the head of product, the VP of product, or the CPO, that all means the same thing dependent on the stage, for the most part.

Lenny (00:21:14):
And the other takeaway there, which is awesome, is if you're early stage startup, probably just start with head of product. Keep it simple.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:19):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Don't over promise. Everyone understands.

Lauren Ipsen (00:21:22):
Yeah. Because the last thing you want to do is have to demote someone. But once you get to a place of having C-level executives, like that's not going to do any good, but maybe you start as a head of product, and then as the company continues to grow, you lean into the growth side of things more, and so you become that head of growth or an SVP of growth. Like things iterate and change, but you just never know and you can't predict the outcome of a company on the front end, so.

Lenny (00:21:49):
A lot of people listening to this probably aren't hiring senior product leaders right now, but plan to and will in the future, and so I wanted to ask, what should founders do when they know they will hire a head of product, say, in the next year, that could set them up for success down the road? What should they be doing ahead of time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:07):
Regardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.

Lauren Ipsen (00:22:43):
Oftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.

Lenny (00:23:11):
That sounds awesome and it makes sense. How do you, as a founder, do some of that? Do you just ask folks like, "Hey, who are some of the best product leaders you know? I just want to chat with them. I'm not hiring, just want to kind of meet people who are awesome." Is that the behavior you suggest or is there something else you can do?

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:27):
That's a great way to go about it. And by simply saying, "No agenda, I'm not trying to hire you tomorrow, I just want to know great people." And to be totally honest, people feel flattered by that, typically. Most of the time if you've been referred to someone and heard nothing but great things about them and you really don't have an agenda other than wanting to pick their brain, people are like, "Huh, well, this is different from the day to day. This is fulfilling," and people want to pour their knowledge, especially into companies that they believe in.

Lauren Ipsen (00:23:58):
So, I think more often than not you'll find that, not just products leaders, but executives across the board are actually really inclined to do so and want to help out because it's a little bit different from the day to day monotony of their work life.

Lenny (00:24:12):
So, the advice is keep track of companies who are killing it, who you might be able to kind of poach from in the future, and keep a list and keep warm contact with folks that are awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:22):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:24:23):
It reminds me of a founder that ... or basically all founders who are really good at hiring and how far ahead they plant seeds and how they just play the long game with the best people they meet, and they just kind of keep the conversation going until they finally convince them to join a year or two later. Do you find that the same thing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:24:41):
Yeah, 1000000%. Yeah. When I was on the executive recruiting side of things at Daversa, the VP of engineering candidate that we ultimately landed, it was a seven month game of courtship, and let's bring him in to help out from an advising capacity, let's ask him how he would think about structuring this organization, let's talk to him about the best talent that he would recommend that we're spending time with. No question that's invasive, but more so just collaborative and exciting, and you'll find that the founder and that leader will build a different level of rapport and trust by not going through a formal interview process and having it feel transactional. And then with that, magic can happen and you can land incredible people.

Lenny (00:25:24):
This all sounds like a lot of work and a lot of time. Do you have guidance on how long it should take to find, like for a early stage startup, say series A or B, to find someone awesome, and/or how much time founders should spend a week, just best practice, on hiring for someone like this?

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:41):
I mean, I think if you're going to search, so if you're looking for this individual, it's really so case to case. There's searches that I've been in that I call three people. I know they're amazing for this. I tell the founder and CEO, "These are the three people you should chat with, hire one of them." And it's that easy.

Lauren Ipsen (00:25:59):
There's others where it's a lot of trying to figure out what the person's actually looking for. If there's some ... they hit it off from an emotional standpoint. There's so many different things that come with it. I would say from a timing perspective, it's not a hard number. It's more of just put yourself in the room with great people. If you have a tremendous amount of respect for someone, continue to harvest that relationship and ask what good looks like. Find excuses to continue to touch base with people that are important in your network. If you remembered that they'd mentioned that they were going to some event and you think that you might want to hire them down the road, in a non-creepy way, show up to that event. These are things that I'm constantly doing, and I think that founders can do a better job of, but just make yourself known and relevant. And then when you reach out and timing is right, it won't feel so obscure or so transactional.

Lenny (00:26:55):
That reminds me of a time at Airbnb where we had these meetups for engineers every month or so where it was a tech talk, and then all the engineers get a target engineer that is coming to the event. Like they get their profile and their picture, and their job is to make sure they have a great time and try to convince them to join someday.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:14):
Oh my god. But it's so real. It's similar to college trips where you're trying to get recruited for a sport, and you have to ensure that you're, yeah, just continuing to give people the best experience possible and staying top of mind for people.

Lenny (00:27:28):
Yeah. But I can see it being creepy, They have no idea there's this person assigned to them, but it works. It worked great. It was a great tactic.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:35):
That's awesome.

Lenny (00:27:36):
I want to come back to a question that I asked, but I feel like you'll have an actual more concrete answer to the specific piece of just, what's your guidance per week how much time you should be spending on hiring broadly, and specifically, heads of product, if that's any different. Do you have any just advice? Because I imagine it's always spend more time than you think. It's going to take a lot of time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:27:54):
Yeah, it's definitely spend more time than you think. If you are in an actual search, then you should devote all of your time to it. I know that sucks to hear, but you should be really carving out concrete time.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:05):
The thing that's tough though is you could spend, I guess what I was trying to say is you could spend one hour on something or you could spend 10 hours on it, but it's more so around, are you doing things to be impactful during that period of time? Are you actually doing things that are going to move the needle? Are you just blindly reaching out to people on LinkedIn? Because that's not going to be the way in which you're going to find the best of the best. Some of the greatest talent, they're not even on LinkedIn.

Lauren Ipsen (00:28:32):
And so I think it's building a really strong network in advance, and then once you actually get to a place where you need to hire that person, calling all of those amazing people that you've built relationships with and saying, "Now tell me who your favorite person is and who the best person you've ever worked with is, and could you put me on a thread with them?" How are you going to differentiate yourself from the rest of the market? So it's less in my mind like a quantitative number of hours and more of, how are you doing things differently than the rest of the market?

Lenny (00:29:01):
I want to pull on this thread. Okay, so spending one hour versus 10 hours, and your point about how you could spend one hour and get as much done maybe in those 10 hours. What sorts of behaviors and actions should folks take to make use of, say, that one hour in hiring? How do you not waste your time?

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:18):
I mean, I would say I've got probably five of my all time favorite product leaders in the world that I tap whenever I'm kicking off a search. And they know that whenever life brings them to an opportunity where they are going to start looking or want to lean into board opportunities, that I'm going to set them up and shout their name from the rooftop, so oftentimes they're willing to point me in the right direction of great people, make those introductions, what have you, and I'm going to know simply because of how great they are that they would never put me in touch with someone that wasn't equally as qualified.

Lauren Ipsen (00:29:55):
So that I think because the quality is there, so I'm not just blindly guessing on quantity, spending a ton of time on LinkedIn, and then having to call unknown entities and ask for back channel references when they also might not even feel comfortable sharing the dirt. You know? So it comes back to rapport and people that you have around you that you know you can trust and tap into and ensuring that you're spending the time in the right areas.

Lenny (00:30:19):
Got it. Yeah, so tapping your network makes a lot of sense. If you don't have that yet, I guess is it worth spending time on LinkedIn just cold messaging people as a founder, and any tips there for just cold outreach that you think work for a founder doing it versus you who are a professional at it?

Lauren Ipsen (00:30:37):
I do think it is worth that time. If you see someone that looks amazing, hell yeah, reach out to them, spend time with them, why not? And oftentimes, again, people are excited to see, oh, this CEO and founder wants to pick my brain, doesn't look like they're coming at me to try and recruit me, but rather just to have an open-ended conversation. For sure, and they can sense. You can definitely sense that type of interaction and feel comfortable with it, whereas sometimes the walls immediately go up when someone senses that they're trying to get poached.

Lauren Ipsen (00:31:08):
And so it's I think something that's worth them doing for sure. It's just if you are going to look for a key executive and are on a time crunch, I don't necessarily think the best use of your time is blindly reaching out to executives when you don't necessarily have the expertise in knowing which companies were thriving during that period of time, which organizations were great, and which were a little bit weaker within companies. All of those things are just the inner workings of the recruiting atmosphere and technology, and I think tapping people, if you don't have the network, talk to a great recruiter or just spend some time kind of doing some research on who's great. You can ask investors or board members in your companies as to who you should be targeting. So there's always got to be one or two people that can at least point you to another three or four.

Lenny (00:31:56):
That reminds me of a tactic Gokul shared on this podcast about one of his best tricks, as you think of, if you're hiring salespeople, instead of looking for who are just the best salespeople, you look for the company that is known for being really good at sales and then you go find people there and try to poach their lieutenant types, not maybe necessarily their head of sales. Do you think that's a good move?

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:17):
Yes and no.

Lenny (00:32:18):
Ooh.

Lauren Ipsen (00:32:19):
Yes and no, because I think if the organization is incredibly good at sales then the majority of the folks are probably amazing, but you always have weak links, and just because someone has a brand on their resume at the right time, I think oftentimes CEOs and founders will do this thing where they kind over generalize, well, Amazon's Prime team at this time was amazing or something like that. It's like, they definitely could have been, but just as any other company, there's going to be people that are breakout, top 1% type individuals, and then other individuals that get to ride the wave and reap the benefits of being at the right place at the right time. And I think that's a good starting place, but then also spending time getting a little bit deeper on who the best people are within that organization. But yeah, we always start with market mapping, so determining who the best companies are within a specific area, and then I just encourage everyone to take that a layer deeper.

Lenny (00:33:16):
Got it. It just comes back to your previous piece of advice. Don't assume someone that has an awesome logo is going to be great, but sometimes they are. There's a question I should have asked you at the beginning that I'm going to ask now. How many folks have you placed? How many companies have you worked with? And then also, is there a story of just your favorite person that you've placed/company you've helped hire that comes to mind?

Lauren Ipsen (00:33:36):
Yeah. So both great questions. I've placed probably 85 executives over the course of my career, and then lots of entry level employees when I was in house, and also some great key leaders. Yeah, probably 85 searches that I've opened and closed, so that's been incredibly fulfilling work. It's also fun too on the exec side of things because you hire the VP of engineering at Postmates and you see firsthand the product change. You know, you watch those types of things happen before your eyes, which is, it's fulfilling stuff, it's really cool.

Lenny (00:34:09):
And delivery gets there faster too.

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:10):
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So, that's really fun. Favorite placement of all time has got to be the VP of engineering that I placed at IRL, which is, to be completely honest, a big reason that I joined that company. Alex Strand is his name, and he is just the most incredible, atypical, high emotional intelligent engineering leader. Still super technical, but has managed teams in the hundreds, built out Amazon Prime Day, then went on to build the core messaging platform at Snapchat, called him and he was like, "Why would I ever leave? There's a ton of financial incentive and a team that I've built that all loves me."

Lauren Ipsen (00:34:54):
And we got him to ultimately make a move in two weeks, which is just kind of unheard of, although it ended up being like a seven month push for a start date, but that was a big reason why I went and joined IRL was to work side by side him and help build out his team and learn to get more deep on the technical side of things. Because oftentimes, on the executive level, as mentioned before, can be sometimes more of that people management type role. And so he just felt like this unique hybrid of an individual, and yeah, you close searches and you cross your fingers and hope for the best and feel very good about it, but he was one where I had all the confidence in the world that I could not have done better. You know? I just felt so great about that. So, that was a good one.

Lenny (00:35:38):
I don't know how much more confidence you could instill in a candidate joining a company than the recruiter also then joining the company.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:44):
Yeah, I did say that to him. I kept saying, "And if I were to go in house, I swear this is probably the company I would do it for." And then about four weeks after he signed, I'd texted him and I said, "Well, you'll never guess."

Lenny (00:35:58):
Wow.

Lauren Ipsen (00:35:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:36:00):
Amazing. What a stamp of confidence.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:02):
Yeah. And a full circle life moment. I sent him a box of cookies, he sent it back and said, "Your turn."

Lenny (00:36:07):
And is he still there at IRL? Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (00:36:09):
Yes, he is. He's great.

Lenny (00:36:12):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.

Lenny (00:36:37):
Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

Lenny (00:36:51):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Lenny (00:37:29):
I want to shift a little bit to kind of flip to the product person's perspective and talk about, how do you be successful as a product leader in finding new opportunities and giving yourself opportunities in the space? And so maybe a first question is just generally, what should product leaders and PMs focus on to give themselves the most opportunity in their career?

Lauren Ipsen (00:37:51):
I think breadth is incredibly important. It's so critical, especially if someone has an end goal of wanting to step into a product leadership role to have been able to have touched lots of different components, as opposed to specializing in one specific thing. So I would say that's very important, to be able to make sure that you're maximizing opportunities for yourself down the road.

Lauren Ipsen (00:38:12):
And then as mentioned before, just always keeping a pulse on the market, regardless of how happy you are in your current company, regardless of what the project is that you're so incredibly excited about that isn't going to conclude until Q1 of next year. It's just so important that you always know the companies that are doing great things and keep those windows open for people, because you never know what the next 12 months hold, and you want to be in a position where you're never running out the door looking for what's next, but rather being able to be super selective about the things that you have in front of you. And that comes with time and network building and relationship building over years, honestly.

Lenny (00:38:54):
And when you say breadth, are you saying things like work on the platform team for a bit, work on the user facing team, maybe the internal tools team, like different types of product, or something else?

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:04):
Exactly that. Yeah. I think there's people that probably want to just be a specialist in growth, or want to get super deep on ads, and if that's the case, then by all means, do so. And I think there's something to be said about that as well because those types of skillsets will be needed. But if you're looking to diversify your skillset, continue to grow from a career trajectory perspective and think about potentially being in a head of product type role, I think it's really important that you touch all aspects of that.

Lenny (00:39:38):
I'm really happy to hear that because that's exactly the advice I give new PMs is that a variety of experience is one of the most powerful things you can do because you also just become a better PM because you can see how different types of products are built and how different types of teams operate and it just makes you better.

Lauren Ipsen (00:39:52):
Yes. Variety of experience, I think taking a bet on doing something more entrepreneurial, starting something, and then also joining things that are a little bit later and more established to get best practices. I think diversifying your skillset within an organization but also diversifying the work in which you're doing and the companies that you're spending time with is awesome.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Yeah. So on that, something I'm always weary of is folks jumping around between all the fancy companies to get a bunch of logos on the resume. "Oh, I worked at Snap and Facebook and Netflix," and I feel like you're just building a resume and then your life flies by, and you forget that you should enjoy the things you're doing and work on things that are fulfilling and optimized for not a great resume. And, curious your thoughts on just how often you think you should move from company to company, one to optimize for opportunities in the future, or just generally, do you recommend people try to move around or go deeper at their company? There's a bunch of questions there, but take it wherever you want to.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:01):
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Sounds good. I think it's an interesting one because logo collecting is never something that you want to be known for, and the first thing you're taught, like entry level recruiting 101 is recognize patterns of candidates that jump from place to place and don't give opportunities a full chance. So, you're spot on. That is definitely not something you want to be known for if you're a prospect.

Lauren Ipsen (00:41:27):
There's also something to be said about staying somewhere too long though. And I will say that. I think sometimes you find people that are almost loyal to a fault, and companies have tanked and all executives have left and the writing's on the wall, and they're holding onto the fact that they were hired by a really good guy or gal and they want to make it work because they care about the human being, and I think sometimes in your career you do have to be a little bit more selfish and think about what's going to be best for you in the long haul. And so maybe that is still keeping your head down and working hard while also being thoughtful about other things that are out there and not saying hard nos to opportunities that knock on your door.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:12):
So it's one where I would say it's an art and a science because you have to be thoughtful about taking on new things and knowing when it's worth taking a bet on yourself, but also you can't run as soon as things get hard because that is recognized, and if there's a riff or an internal dispute or a new leader brought in, and that is so quick as to make you run for the fences, that's not something that people look for because startup world is hard, tech is hard. Look at the crypto world right now. Things are incredibly volatile and difficult, and you want to be able to bring people in that are going to hang with you through the highs and lows.

Lauren Ipsen (00:42:55):
We're always looking to see where people moved the needle, especially on the product side, where their fingerprints were, what they can actually point to that they did and are proud of during their time there. And so if all that they can say that they did was onboarded and moved on, then doesn't matter where you were, but it's not going to be something that I can at least stand on to cheer you on.

Lenny (00:43:22):
I really like that. A lot of this comes down to, what impact have you made? And I was going to touch on that, and your point is, one, kind of heuristic for how long to stay at a place at the minimum is have some meaningful impact you can point to that you led. Does that sound right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:43:35):
Yeah, exactly. And have that meaningful impact be something that others can speak to. I think that's huge. If you built something within the organization that you're proud of but no one knows about it, then that's more difficult to have as your stamp of approval for what you are able to accomplish there. But if you did something that cross-functional leaders were speaking to, that your team all sings the praises of, then that is something that you can put a feather in the cap and say, "Okay, I left this place better than I found it, and that's the reason that I have decided to move forward."

Lenny (00:44:15):
And I imagine part of that is reference checks. People are going to check to see if you actually were successful.

Lauren Ipsen (00:44:20):
All the time. Yup. Whether you are exploratory, opportunistic, not looking at all, people are constantly calling each other, and the world of tech is so, so, so small, and no matter how fired up you were leaving a company or what went sideways, it is so critical that you try to leave the place better than you found it and do so as seamlessly as possible, because you want people to have nothing but positive to say. And oftentimes, that ... The thing that I always find too is if I call 10 people that were a part of the same organization as someone during a given period of time and they can't speak to anything they did, in that case, no news is not necessarily good news. You want to have an impact, you want to be able to say, "I did X, Y and Z. I'm super proud of this and the reason I moved on is because I did what I came in to accomplish."

Lenny (00:45:20):
It's a little bit innately tricky for product leaders. I imagine you run into this, that sometimes you have to upset people as a product leader to get stuff done that needs to get done and maybe they disagree and then later it's like, okay, I see what you did. Is that true? Do you deal with that or is it generally like, oh, yeah, they're the great people everyone knows, like a hundred percent of people will say they're awesome?

Lauren Ipsen (00:45:38):
It's a really good question. I think there's a way to navigate conflict without rubbing people the wrong way so that they'll say negative things. There's a way to be an impactful product leader and disagree and make change, and maybe your engineering leader and design leader and marketing leader completely disagree with the direction in which you're going, but because you have all of the data to support it and because you have gone about things in a way that feels very fact first and less emotional, it's really difficult for them to then point to why they disliked this person.

Lenny (00:46:19):
Yeah. This is interesting. So say you make those 10 calls, in your experience, the leaders you want to hire, are you finding 10 out of 10 are generally like, "Yes, this person's amazing, you should hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:31):
There's ones that are slam dunks and no one has any negative to say. That's incredibly rare. More often you find some people like to just have something negative to say, just to have something negative to say. I also take all of my back channels with a grain of salt. Maybe the person I'm calling to back channel this person with I also haven't back channeled, right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:46:50):
So every single thing that you hear, you just take, make note of, and then move on and think more holistically about. But I think typically what I would say is the glaring nos are very obvious. People that are polarizing individuals or have done wrong within an organization or made bad calls across the board are, you can get that information typically pretty quick.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:13):
It's the mixed ones where it's, "I think that person was decent," those are pretty tough, and you need to really find people that worked super closely with them because otherwise it's pretty difficult to say whether or not they were able to make an impact. Which again comes back to why right off the bat it's so nice to just have people that you can tap within every organization that's like an academy company or a great company and say, "Point me in the direction of the three best people." I don't want to have to go through the burden of having to try and back channel all of the maybe middle 50% or what have you.

Lenny (00:47:48):
Yeah, most people don't have that, which is a reason to hire, work with a recruiter. You come build in with all of that network.

Lauren Ipsen (00:47:55):
Totally. Totally there. Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:56):
There's a couple things I want to touch on that I wasn't planning to touch on, but reference calls. You do a lot of them, I imagine. And I'm curious, do you have any tips for how to ask questions on a reference call where you actually get useful advice where it's not just, "Yes, I like them, they're great. Hire them"?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:11):
Especially on references, provided references, I've only had two candidates where provided references have come back negative, which that's tough. Outside of that, typically references are a standard. It is important to dig pretty deep and ask the hard questions.

Lenny (00:48:28):
What's the hard questions?

Lauren Ipsen (00:48:29):
Yeah, why would I not hire this person? What are their biggest weaknesses? And then if they give you the typical, "Oh, if they work too hard," it's like, no, tell me more. What are their actual weaknesses? What are things that we should be really cognizant of? Would you hire this person again? Would you report to this person? Would you endorse this person if you knew that your name was attached to it? Things like that I think get people thinking, and even if you just sense the slightest pause, that in itself will be enough to make you think twice. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:04):
So it's a lot of reading the room and probing harder than you think necessary, which is tough. But back channel references I think will always provide a greater source of truth than provided. It's similar to an Instagram Reel as opposed to the photos you're tagged in. That's the way I think of it. It's like this is what you want the world to see or think of you as, and then these are what your peers and your direct reports and the people around you actually say about the work that you did during this time.

Lenny (00:49:33):
Awesome. Coming back to a point you made about recruiter training 101, you learn how to find patterns and red flags in people's resume. What else is a red flag in your resume that you want to avoid/there's a rule of thumb of like, if you're at a place for less than a year, it's bad. Is that true? How do you feel about that? How do hiring managers generally feel about that?

Lauren Ipsen (00:49:53):
It definitely depends, with regards to being at a place less than a year. If that's a recurring theme, of course that's a big red flag. Even if it's happened two or three times, three definitely. If it's happened twice, it's like, "Huh, that feels off." You got to let people tell their story though and their side of things, and again, it comes back to reaching out to different people and understanding if what they're saying is true was actually the truth. And so when you have a really good pulse on what's happening in tech and whether there was a riff and the reason that person was let go was actually because they weren't prioritizing a certain part of the product or whatever, like those things, it happens. That's life, especially right now, right? If we were to X every single person that has a short stint that joined a new company over the course of the past year, that wouldn't do anyone any good.

Lauren Ipsen (00:50:44):
Another thing I've found that's pretty interesting is that people will often, because they're so afraid of that narrative, they'll often not include on their resume companies that they didn't stay for a year. And in my personal opinion, that's actually almost more of a red flag because that did happen, and you don't want to just pretend like that wasn't a decision you made in your life, and usually is handled with grace. You can speak to the reason that you decided to make a bet, the reason that you went there, and the reason that you moved on, in a way that people can typically resonate with. But I've seen executives just put that they've simply been advising for two years or something like that, when in reality they had two companies that failed.

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:33):
And the fact of the matter is, I have some CFO candidates I'm talking to right now and their past three years have been short stints because they were brought in to take a company through an IPO and then that changed, or they were brought in to enter into a SPAC and then that became less of the buzz. Right?

Lauren Ipsen (00:51:51):
So these things happen and roles change, and I think it's just allowing people to tell their story is the most important thing. So I would say red flag is, for me, just always be honest about when you started, when you left a company. If I see that someone still has present on their LinkedIn but they've been gone for two years and they kind of are acting like they're still there, that doesn't feel good. Just want people to give you the truth, the straight facts, so that you can support them and tell their story and represent them in a way that makes you feel like you have all the details.

Lenny (00:52:23):
Got it. So basically, don't lie. That makes sense. That reminds me a little bit of people kind of upgrade their titles a little bit because maybe they don't have an official title or they just want to sound a little important. How do you feel about when people do that on their resumes?

Lauren Ipsen (00:52:35):
Yeah, I don't love that. I also don't love on the resume when people, and some people do this and it's okay, but when people say silly, vague names like they'll say something along the lines of, "Whatever at Reddit," as their title or, "Master of blank at this," and it's like, okay, what were you actually doing?

Lenny (00:52:58):
But I think they do that to avoid recruiters reaching out to them.

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:00):
Exactly. As their direct target, I'm pissed. So I feel directly attacked in that regard. So that's something that throws me off, but that could definitely be a personal thing. And I think overall, for the most part, people don't have any other things that really just throw me for a loop. And the fact of the matter is, resumes we look at less and less, especially at the executive level, and it's a lot more of allowing people to tell their story, meeting in person, talking with their different people that support them, and getting kind of more of the big picture around who they are.

Lenny (00:53:33):
I want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question: do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?

Lauren Ipsen (00:53:45):
I've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it seems obvious, but you would be surprised how not obvious it is.

Lauren Ipsen (00:54:10):
So thinking about things more holistically, speaking honestly about your strengths and things that you want to continue to grow and improve upon, and then being able to tell your story, like practice telling your story. So often people don't do that, especially when they're not looking for jobs, and then it's not until their 10th interview that they know how to tell their story and what they did and what they impacted and why they were someone to be missed when they moved on. Those are things that you want to know how to speak to, and unless it's something you've been doing or practicing, it's less natural. That's some advice I think just off the top of the head.

Lenny (00:54:45):
Awesome. That's really good advice. One thing that makes me think about, I know I want to get to this last section, but do you think the best product leaders have their kind of story figured out in the future and work backwards from that and have a sense of where they want to end up, or just kind of take it as it goes? Because I'm the latter. I had no plan, I just went to see ... follow the path that was presented. Do you think that is generally true for folks that end up being successful, or do you recommend people think about, "Here's where I want to be in five years, here's what I need to do to get there"? Do you have any guidance there?

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:18):
I mean, for what it's worth, I'm definitely more with you. I don't know where I want to be in five years, so it's tough for me to say. But I do think that typically someone that has the end goal of being a CEO will put the pieces into place to try and get there, and so it's not a bad idea if you do have an end goal of wanting to run your own thing to inch towards that. So maybe you go from being a product specific leader to then operating in some type of GM of a business unit capacity and owning a P&L, and then although it's more of a product oriented role, you're still getting closer and closer to that end goal of COO or CEO.

Lauren Ipsen (00:55:53):
So if it's something like that, then I think that naturally makes sense. Do think people can be enticed by shiny objects, so excited because it's a step up from a title perspective and things like that, and I think that's just so not important in the grand scheme of things. You could be the VP of product or a CPO of what, you know? That's so vague. If someone just says, "I want to be a chief product officer, that's the end goal," I always say, "Of what?" You could be the chief product officer of your household. Is it of a multi-billion dollar consumer brand or ...

Lauren Ipsen (00:56:32):
So I guess what I'm trying to say is work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile.

Lenny (00:57:01):
I love that advice. So many people just chase some fancy new role, new title, new logo, and end up getting there like, "Man, this sucks."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:08):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:57:09):
This reminds me, I did a meditation retreat once and one of the teachings there was you don't want to be fixated with achieving a specific thing, but you want to push your cart in that direction, just like head that direction and have a general sense, but not, "I need to be that thing and that's what'll make me happy."

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:26):
Exactly. I think that's exactly right.

Lenny (00:57:27):
Awesome. Okay. Final topic is from the recruiter perspective, what do you find recruiters do wrong most often or miss when they're trying to attract great product talent to a company?

Lauren Ipsen (00:57:38):
Yeah, so this is one I feel especially passionate about because I do think recruiters have a bit of a reputation, and I think that it's for some good reason. There's naturally people that forget that these are human beings that we're dealing with every single day that have lives, have families, have careers, or ambitions outside of their career.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:01):
So I think it's essential that you remember that this is another human being on the other end of things and that you should treat them with the same level of respect that you would expect to be treated.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:15):
This has become even more apparent now that I have gone through some of my own recruiting cycles where I was looking for different jobs, and a transactional recruiting call just will rub you so the wrong way and will make you want to put things on your resume like I just alluded to that say things like, "Whatever at Reddit," or what have you because you just don't want to deal with it.

Lauren Ipsen (00:58:36):
And so I think you have to be a human, you have to start with a relationship, find common ground, build rapport, listen to people, like actually listen, and remember what they say. So if someone says, "I never want to do a crypto company," and I just am only shoving crypto companies down their throat, that's just insanely tone deaf. Or if they say, "I have this vest that I really want to be around for in May of next year," and I just keep hitting them up prior to that, that's just so not receptive to what they just said.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:12):
Things like that, make notes if easier, because we speak to so many people all day long so it's definitely not easy to do. But I'll have a note on my calendar that John Kim's vest just happened in March, and then I'll be like, "Oh, okay, might be a good time for me to catch up." I won't say, "Congrats on the recent vest." I'll say, "You want to grab a coffee, or do you want to catch up about this?" Or, "Hey, I saw that you were speaking at this conference, love what you spoke about with regards to this." You got to find ways to connect with people outside of just shoving them into a job.

Lauren Ipsen (00:59:46):
And so I would say something that I've learned and become very good at is starting with a foundation of relationship building, gaining trust from people, because once you have that, then people will hear you out on jobs and people will listen to you and actually trust your advice from a career direction and perspective, but that takes time to build that, and it's definitely not going to be built by just chucking things at the wall and seeing what sticks with people and seeing where you can shove them temporarily. In fact, that will make them lose trust. And once you lose trust in a candidate, it's impossible to get it back.

Lenny (01:00:22):
It's interesting how one of the recurring themes of our chat so far is just play the long game in every way, which takes more time.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:28):
Yes.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Kind of sucks that you have to put in all this time ahead of time before you really need to get something done, but what you keep coming back to is just that's how you end up being successful as a recruiter, as a product leader, as a hiring manager, as a founder.

Lauren Ipsen (01:00:39):
A million percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really easy when you've got a quota to hit and you've got people to provide for and a mortgage to just think about the numbers, but you have to play the long game because people aren't just a commodity. It's so much more.

Lenny (01:00:56):
And one of the perks of working with a recruiter is they have done that already for you, and so I was going to ask, when does it make sense for a founder to engage with a recruiter like yourself and when should they not?

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:08):
Engaging with recruiters sooner rather than later in a proactive way is always a positive thing. It's just sometimes companies aren't at the stage where they can necessarily hire a full-time recruiter because of resources and how expensive it is to bring in an exec recruiter.

Lauren Ipsen (01:01:26):
So having someone that you can bounce things off of in a more informal capacity, bringing in someone like a talent advisor that can help in a consultative way, those types of things, a million percent. Leaning into the venture firms that have backed you, which is a lot of what I'm doing right now, that is definitely areas in which early CEO founders should be leaning into that and trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. And then I would say typically series B feels ... series A, dependent on the check size, and then series B feels like a good time to bring in a couple key big players, if the company's well positioned to do so.

Lenny (01:02:06):
And bring in meaning full-time in-house recruiters or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:09):
Probably bring in a firm. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. I think you can bring in one or two recruiters in the early days like seed, if it makes sense for the company and they're growing quickly, but it's all kind of case to case.

Lenny (01:02:22):
The fact that you're kind of off the table for most founders now that you're at GC, which is a part ... And is that true? Like you basically at this point work for General Catalyst founders, is that correct?

Lauren Ipsen (01:02:32):
I am supporting all of our GC founders in the consumer and crypto portfolio. That being said, I spend all day every single day networking and chatting with amazing entrepreneurs, people that could be founding a company down the road and need some advice, great people that want to help in an advising capacity. So it is, I would say, 50% networking, 50% actual parachuting into portfolio.

Lenny (01:03:00):
Got it. Okay.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:01):
Supporting them.

Lenny (01:03:01):
That's cool. I didn't know that part.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:03):
So outside of that, what do you suggest founders look for when they're looking for a recruiter, and the second to last question, what are signs that this is a good firm, a good recruiter? Just what should you be looking for when you're looking to hire a recruiter, either in house or a firm?

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:15):
I think it's important to provide them with some direction and then see if they can recite it back to you. Tell them the types of things you're looking for and then say, "Did that resonate? Because I'd love to hear from you what you took away from that and what you think we should be looking for."

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:32):
And then kind of off the bat, ask them for a couple candidate ideas. Don't give them time to just go call other people. In real time, ask them for some candidate ideas. Where does their brain go? Who are people they would call tomorrow on this? The more that you can get that dynamic relationship formed before you even go to search, the more you can determine whether this is someone you want to calibrate with.

Lauren Ipsen (01:03:54):
So yeah, I think just putting them on the spot a little bit and asking them to show their work rather than just sending over a deck of searches that could have been done by other partners or could have just been done by other people on their team. You want to actually understand who this person is. So that first question is testing their listening skills and their ability to actually hear what you're saying and what you're looking for, and then the second is, okay, now how quickly can we get calibrated on what this profile should look like.

Lenny (01:04:21):
Awesome. That is great advice. Very tactical. Any final words or wisdom before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lauren Ipsen (01:04:26):
This has been awesome, by the way. I think more generally, the advice is just treat people like human beings, build rapport, play the long game, and gain trust, and that takes time. And so those are the most important things from a recruiting standpoint, is being able to tap people and have them feel like you genuinely have their best interest at heart and that you care about their career and life outside their career. And so I think that's what makes for a really good recruiter.

Lenny (01:04:53):
Simple advice, but often forgotten and easy to overlook. Awesome. All right. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to give you six questions, whatever comes to mind, we'll go through them real fast. Does that sound good?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:08):
Okay. Yes. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:05:10):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:14):
The Power of Now and You Are Here.

Lenny (01:05:17):
Wow. Awesome. What are favorite other podcasts that you listen to other than this one?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:22):
I mean, there's tech ones, but Your Own Backyard because I went to Cal Poly, so that one hits a little close to home.

Lenny (01:05:28):
Wow, I haven't heard of that. Cool. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've watched that you've enjoyed?

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:34):
Top Gun I've watched too many times and-

Lenny (01:05:39):
The new Top Gun.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:39):
Yeah. And then TV show. Oh, it's all trash reality, so I just can't tell you.

Lenny (01:05:45):
I get that. I understand. My wife has that and she can't tell anyone. Yeah.

Lauren Ipsen (01:05:51):
That's my one secret.

Lenny (01:05:51):
All right. Okay, great. We'll move on, but that's great. What's a favorite ... Oh, this is interesting. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask or maybe you've seen someone ask?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:01):
I love the good strengths and weaknesses question. I think it's really good to see how people self-analyze themselves.

Lenny (01:06:06):
What do you look for in their answer that's the sign that it's well answered?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:10):
Honesty, authenticity. Can read right through a, "Work too hard," answer or a perfectionist type answer. What are your weaknesses? Let's talk about it.

Lenny (01:06:19):
For real.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:21):
So that one I think is always a really good test of character.

Lenny (01:06:24):
What are some favorite apps right now?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:27):
I've been playing around on BeReal. I mean, I love Spotify, it's straightforward. And then I've been on Strava, I've been running, so that are the-

Lenny (01:06:34):
That's a good combination of apps. That's like a full life.

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:37):
Thank you. Thanks so much. Trying to be.

Lenny (01:06:41):
Final question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a leader and a thought leader influence type person?

Lauren Ipsen (01:06:49):
My first boss out of college, Joe Suliman, is awesome. He's always taught me to lead with that relationship-based approach and it's really so easy to say that you do that, but then to actually do it and live it out for the people that work for you, as well as the people that are in industry and speak of you, is something else. And so he's always taught me to do that, and I just learned a ton from him and he's just incredibly smart and in tune with what's happening in industry and makes great stances and opinions on how to navigate those types of things. So, he's someone that I have an immense amount of respect for.

Lenny (01:07:24):
Sounds like an amazing person. Lauren, this was excellent. I feel like this is going to be useful to so many people, product managers, founders, other recruiters, all kinds of other people. Thank you so much for doing this and making the time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or maybe collaborate with you and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:07:44):
Yes, absolutely. And also, thank you. This has been so much fun. They can reach out to me on LinkedIn. I happen to be on that one quite a bit, so definitely can DM me there, can send me an email, and I can shoot you that over as well. And then the way they can be helpful is if there's people that they think the world of, shoot them my way. If they have questions around best ways to go through an interview process or how to navigate different things, please, by all means, a huge part of my job is trying to help people that are going through this for the first time. Happy to just be a sounding board or of help in any capacity.

Lenny (01:08:19):
So if you're an awesome product leader, you want to see what's out there, find Lauren on LinkedIn. Is that the best place to find you?

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:24):
That's perfect.

Lenny (01:08:25):
All right. Awesome.

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:25):
Yep.

Lenny (01:08:25):
Thanks, Lauren.

Lauren Ipsen (01:08:26):

# Inside OpenAI | Logan Kilpatrick (head of developer relations)

## Transcript

Logan Kilpatrick (00:00:00):
Finding people who are high agency and work with urgency, if I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to get 50 people's different consensus. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having, and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that... People just go and do it and solve the problem, and I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Today my guest is Logan Kilpatrick. Logan is head of developer relations at OpenAI, where he supports developers building on open AI's, APIs and ChatGPT. Before OpenAI, Logan was a machine learning engineer at Apple and advised NASA on their open source policy. If you can believe it, ChatGPT launched just over a year ago and transformed the way that we think about AI and what it means for our products and our lives. Logan has been at the front lines of this change, and every day is helping developers and companies figure out how to leverage these new AI superpowers.

(00:01:10):
In our conversation, we dig into examples of how people are using ChatGPT and the new GPTs and other open AI APIs in their work and their life. Logan shares some really interesting advice on how to get better at prompt engineering. We also get into how OpenAI operates internally, how they ship so quickly, and the two key attributes they look for in the people that they hire, plus, where Logan sees the biggest opportunities for new products and new startups building on their APIs.

(00:01:38):
We also get a little bit into the very dramatic weekend that OpenAI had with the board and Sam Altman and all of that, and so much more. A huge thank you to Dan Shipper and Dennis Ing for some great questions, suggestions. With that, I bring you Logan Kilpatrick after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:56):

(00:03:52):
Logan, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:03:55):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:03:57):
I want to start with the elephant in the room, which I think the elephant is actually leaving the room because I think this is months ago at this point, but I'm still just really curious. What was it like on the inside of OpenAI during the very dramatic weekend with the board and Sam and all those things? What was it like? And is there a story maybe you could share that maybe people haven't heard about what it was like on the inside, what was going on?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:04:20):
Yeah, it was definitely a very stressful Thanksgiving week. I think in broad context, OpenAI had been pushing for a really long time, since ChatGPT came out, and that was supposed to be one of the first weeks that the whole company had taken time away to actually reset and have a break. So very selfishly, I was super excited to spend time with my family, all that stuff. And then, yeah, Friday afternoon we got the message that all of the changes were happening, and I think it was super shocking because I think, and this is a perspective a lot of folks share, everybody had and continues to have such deep trust in Sam and Greg and our leadership team that it was just very surprising. And we're also a very, as far as company cultures go, very transparent and very open. So when there's problems or there's things going on, we tend to hear about them. And again, it was the first time that a lot of us had heard some of the things that were happening between the board and the leadership team, so very, very surprising.

(00:05:20):
I think my being someone who's not based in San Francisco, I was, again, very selfishly kind of happy that it happened over the Thanksgiving break because a lot of folks actually had gone home to different places. So it felt like I had a little bit of comfort knowing I wasn't the only one not in San Francisco, because everybody was meeting up in person to do a bunch of stuff and be together during that time. So it was nice to know that there was a few other folks who were sort of out of the loop with me.

(00:05:51):
I think the thing that surprised me the most was just how quickly everybody got back to business. I flew to San Francisco the next week after Thanksgiving, which I wasn't planning to do, to deal with the team in person and seeing, literally Monday morning, I was walking into the office being, like expecting, I don't know, something weird to be going on or happening. And really it was like people laser focused and back to work, and I think that speaks to the caliber of our team and everybody who's just so excited about building towards the mission that we're building towards. So I think that was, yeah, that was the most surprising thing of the whole incident. I think a lot of companies would've had the potential to truly be derailed for some non-trivial amount of time by this, and everybody was just right back to it, which I love.

Lenny (00:06:40):
I feel like it also maybe brought the team closer together. It feels like it was this kind of traumatic experience that may bring folks together because it was something they all shared. Is there anything along those lines that's like, "Wow, things are a little different now?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:06:52):
One of my takeaways was I'm actually very grateful that this happened when it happened. I think today the stakes are... They're still relatively high. People have built their businesses on top of OpenAI. We have tons of customers who love ChatGPT, so if something bad happens to us, we definitely impact our customers. But on the world scale, somebody else will build a model if OpenAI disappeared and continue towards this progress of general intelligence. I think fast-forward five or 10 years, if something like this would've happened and we hadn't gone through the hopeful upcoming work transformation and all those changes that are going to happen, I think it would've been a little bit, or potentially much worse, of an outcome. So I'm glad that things happened when the stakes are a little bit lower.

(00:07:39):
And I totally agree with you. It's like the team has been growing so rapidly over the last year since I joined. It's been crazy to think about how many new folks there are, and I really think that this really brought people together because most folks, historically, many of the folks when I joined, what kind of banded us all together was the launch of ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-4, and for folks who weren't around for some of those launches, it was perhaps step day. For folks who are on for dev day, it was probably this event. So I think we've had these events that have really brought the company together cross-functionally, so hopefully all the future ones will be really exciting things like GPT five, whenever that comes, and stuff like that.

Lenny (00:08:20):
Awesome. We're going to talk about GPT-5. Going in a totally different direction, what is the most mind-blowing or surprising thing that you've seen AI do recently?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:31):
The things that are getting me most excited are these new interfaces around AI, like the Rabbit R-1. I don't know if you've seen that, but consumer hardware device, this company called TL Draw. I don't know if you've seen TL Draw.

Lenny (00:08:44):
I think. You sketch something and then it makes it as a website?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:08:48):
And that's only a small piece of what TL Draw is actually working on, but there's all of these new interfaces to interact with AI, and I think I was having a conversation with the TL Draw folks a couple of days ago, really blows my mind to think about how chat is the predominant way that folks are using AI today. And I actually think, and this is my bulk case for the folks at TL Draw, I'm super excited for them to build what they're building, but they're sort of building this infinite canvas experience and you can imagine how, as you're interacting with an AI on a daily basis, you might want to jump over to your infinite canvas, which the AI has filled in all the details and you might see a reference to a file and to a video and all of these different things.

(00:09:30):
And it's such a cool way. It actually makes a lot more sense for us as humans to see stuff in that type of format than, I think, just listing out a bunch of stuff in chat. So I'm really, really excited to see more people. I think 2024 is the year of multimodal AI, but it's also the year that people really push the boundaries of some of these new UX paradigms around AI.

Lenny (00:09:53):
It's funny. I feel like Chatbots, as a PM for many years, it feels like every brainstorming session we had about new features, it's like, "Hey, we should have built a Chatbot to solve this problem." It's like the perennial like, "Oh, Chatbot," or, "Someone's going to suggest we do a Chatbot," and now they're actually useful and working and everyone's building Chatbots, a lot of them based on OpenAI APIs.

(00:10:12):
There's not really a question there, but maybe the question, I was going to get to this later, is just when people are thinking about building a product like, say, TL Draw, what should they think about? Where OpenAI is not going to go versus here's what OpenAI is going to do for us. We shouldn't worry about them building a version of TL Draw in the future. What's the way to think about where you won't be disrupted essentially by OpenAI, knowing also they may change their mind?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:10:36):
That's a great question. I think we're deeply focused on these very, very general use cases like the general reasoning capabilities, the general coding, the general writing abilities. I think where you start to get into some of these very vertical applications... And I think a great example of this is actually Harvey. I don't know if you've seen Harvey, but it's this legal AI use case where they're building custom models and tools to help lawyers and people at legal firms and stuff like that. And that's a great example of our models are probably never going to be as capable as some of the things that Harvey's doing because our goal and our mission is really to solve this very general use case and then people can do things like fine-tuning and build all their own custom UI and product features on top of that.

(00:11:17):
I have a lot of empathy and a lot of excitement for people who are building these very general products today. I talk to a lot of developers who are building just general purpose assistants and general purpose agents and stuff like that. I think it's cool and it's a good idea. I think the challenge for them is they are going to end up directly competing against us in those spaces and I think there's enough room for a lot of people to be successful, but to me you shouldn't be surprised when we end up launching some general purpose agent product because, again, we're sort of building that with GPTs today and versus we're not going to launch some of these varied verticalized products. We're not going to launch an AI sales agent. That's just not what we're building towards. And companies who are and have some domain specific knowledge and they're really excited about that problem space, they can go into that and leverage our models and end up continuing to be on the cutting edge without having to do all that R&D effort themselves.

Lenny (00:12:16):
Got it. So the advice I'm hearing is get specific about use cases, and that could be either models that are tuned to be especially useful for a use case like sales or make an interface or experience solving a more specific problem.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:12:30):
And I think if you're going to try and solve this very general, if you're going to try to build the next general assistant to compete with something like ChatGPT, it has to be so radically different. People have to really be like, "Wow, this is solving these 10 problems that I have with ChatGPT, and therefore I'm going to go and try your new thing." Otherwise we're just putting a ton of engineering efforts and research effort into making that an incredible product, and it's just going to be the normal challenges of building companies. It's just hard to compete against something like that.

Lenny (00:12:59):
Awesome. Okay, that's great. I was going to get to that later, but I'm glad we touched on that. I imagine that's on the minds of many developers and founders. Kind of along the same lines, there's a lot of talk about how ChatGPT and GPTs and many of the tools you guys offer are going to make a company much more efficient. They don't need as many engineers, data scientists, PMs, things like that, but I think it's also hard for companies to think about what can we actually do to make our company more efficient. I'm curious if there's any examples that you can share of how companies have taken built a, say, a GPT internally to do something so that they don't have to spend engineering hours on it or generally just used OpenAI tooling to make their business internally more efficient?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's a great question. I wonder if you can put this in the show notes or something like that, but there's a really great Harvard Business School study about... And I forgot which consulting firm they did it with. Maybe it was like Boston Consulting or something like that, but it might've been one of the other ones. And they talk about the order of magnitude of efficiency gain for those folks who are using AI tools, I think it was chat GPT specifically in those use cases that they were using, comparatively against folks who aren't using AI. I'm really excited, also, just as just more time passes between the release of this technology, for us to get more empirical studies. I feel just for myself, as somebody who's an engineer today, I use ChatGPT and I can ship things way faster than I would be able to.

(00:14:26):
I don't have any good metrics for myself to put a specific number on it, but I'm guessing people are working on those studies right now. I think engineering is actually one of the highest leverage things that you could be using AI to do today and really unlocking, probably on the order of at least a 50% improvement, especially for some of the lower hanging fruit software engineering tasks. The models are just so capable at doing that work. And it's crazy to think... And I'm guessing, actually, GitHub probably has a bunch of really great studies they publish around copilots and you could use those as an analogy for what people are getting from ChatGPT as well. But those are probably the highest leverage things.

(00:15:07):
I think now with GPTs, people are able to go in and solve some of these more tactical problems. I think one of the general challenges with ChatGPT is it gives a decent answer for a lot of different use cases, but oftentimes it's not particular enough to the voice of your company or the nuance of the work that you're doing. And I think now with GPTs and people who are using the teams in ChatGPT and Enterprise in ChatGPT, they can actually build those things, incorporate the nuance of their own company, and make solving those tasks much, much more domain specific. So we literally just launched GPTs a couple of months ago, so I don't think there's been any good public success stories, but I'm guessing that success is happening right now at companies, and hopefully we'll hear more about that in the months to come as folks get super excited about sharing those case studies.

Lenny (00:15:58):
I'll share an example. So I have this good friend, his name's Dennis Yang, he works at Chime, and he told me about two things that they're doing at Chime that seem to be providing value. One is he built a GPT that helps write ads for Facebook and Google just gives you ideas for ads to run, and so that takes a little load off the marketing team or the growth team. And then he built another GPT that delivers experiment results, kind of like a data scientist, with here's the result of this experiment. And then you could talk to it and ask for like, "Hey, how much longer do you think we should run this for," or, "What might this imply about our product," and things like that. And I think it's really-

Logan Kilpatrick (00:15:58):
I love that.

Lenny (00:16:35):
Like you said. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just things you've heard people do just like, "Wow, that was a really smart way of... " So I get there's engineering, co-piloting type tooling. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just to give people a little inspiration of like, "Wow, that's an interesting way I should be thinking about using some of these tools."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:16:50):
I've seen some interesting GPTs around the planning use cases, like you want to do OKR planning for your team or something like that. I just actually saw somebody tweet it literally yesterday. I've seen some cool venture capital ones of doing diligence on a deal flow, which is kind of interesting, and getting some different perspectives. I think all of those horizontal use cases where you can bring in a different personality and get perspective on different things I think is really cool. I've personally used a GPT, the private GPT that I use myself that helps with some of the planning stuff for different quarters, and just making sure that I'm being consistent in how I'm framing things like driving back to individual metrics, stuff that, when people do planning, they often miss in our data, and then it's been super helpful for me to have a GPT to force me to think about some of those things.

Lenny (00:17:43):
Wait, can you talk more about this? What does this GPT do for you and what do you feed it?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:17:48):
Yeah, I forgot what article I saw online, but it was some article that was talking about what are the best ways to set yourself up for success in planning. And I took a bunch of the... I'll see if I can make it public after this and send you a link, but took a bunch of the examples from that and went in and put some of those suggestions into the GPT, and then now when I do any of my planning of I want to build this thing, I put it through and have it generate a timeline, generate all the specifics of what are the metrics and success that I'm looking for, who might be some important cross-functional stakeholders to include in the planning process, all that stuff, and it's been helpful.

Lenny (00:18:25):
Wow, that is very cool. That would be awesome if you made it public. And if you do, we'll link to it and we'll make it the number one most popular GPT in the store.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:18:35):
I love it.

Lenny (00:18:35):
Going in a slightly different direction, there's this whole genre of prompt engineering. It feels like it's one of these really emerging skills. I actually saw a startup hiring a prompt engineer, one of the startups I've invested in, and I think that's going to blow a lot of people's minds that there's this new job that's emerging. And I know the idea is this won't last forever, that in theory AI will be so smart you don't need to really think about how to be smart about asking it for things you need it to do. But can you just describe this idea of what is prompt engineering, this term that people might be hearing? And then even more interestingly, just what advice do you have for people to get better at writing prompts for, say, ChatGPT or through the API in general?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:19:13):
Yeah, this is such an interesting space, and I think it's another space where I'm excited for people to do more scientific empirical studies about, because there's so much gut feeling, best practices that maybe aren't actually true in a certain way. I think the reason that prompt engineering exists and comes up at all is because the models are so inclined, because of the way that they're trained, to give you just an answer to the question that you ask. Crap in crap out. If you ask a pretty basic question, you're going to get a pretty basic response. And actually the same thing is true for humans, and you can think of a great example of this. When I go to another human and I ask, "How's your day going," they say, "It's going pretty good."

(00:19:53):
Literally, absolutely zero detail, no nuance, not very interesting at all versus, again, if you have some context with a person, if you have a personal relationship with them and I ask you, "Hey Lenny, how's your day going? How did the last podcast go," et cetera, et cetera, you just have a little bit more context and agency to go and answer my question. I think this is prompt engineering.

(00:20:13):
My whole position on this is prompt engineering is a very human thing. When we want to get some value out of a human, we do this prompt engineering. We try to effectively communicate with that human in order to get the best output. And the same thing is true of models. And I think it's like, again, because we're using a system that appears to be really smart, we assume that it has all this context, but it's really like imagine a human level intelligence but literally no context. It has no idea what you're going to ask it. It's never met you before. It has no idea who you are, what you do, what your goals are. And it's the reason that you get super generic responses sometimes is because people forget they need to put that context in the model.

(00:20:57):
So I think the thing that is going to help solve this problem, and we already kind of do this in the context of Dali, so when you go to the image generation model that we have, Dali, and you say, "I want a picture of a turtle," what it does is it actually takes that description. It says, "I want a picture of a turtle," and it changes it into this high fidelity, like generate a picture of a turtle with a shell, with a green background and lily pads in the water and all this other. It adds all this fidelity because that's the way that the model is trained. It's trained on examples with super high fidelity. This will happen with text models.

(00:21:35):
You can imagine a world where you go into ChatGPT and you say, "Write me a blog post about AI." It automatically will go and be like, "Let me generate a much higher fidelity description of what this person really wants, which is generate me a blog post about AI that talks about the trade-offs between these different techniques and some example use cases and references some of the latest papers," and it does all that for you, and then you at the user will hopefully be able to be like, "Yep, this is kind of what I wanted. Let me edit this. Let me edit this here."

(00:22:02):
And again, the inherent problem is we're lazy as humans. We don't want to type all... We don't really want to type what we mean, and I think AI systems are actually going to help solve some of that problem.

Lenny (00:22:12):
So until that day, what can people do better when they're prompting, say ChatGPT? And I'll give you an example. Tim Ferris suggested this really good idea that I've been stealing, which is when you're preparing for an interview, you go to chat GPT. And so I did this for you. I was like, "Hey, I'm interviewing Logan Kilpatrick, he is head of developer relations at OpenAI, on my podcast. Give me 10 questions to ask him in the style of Tyler Cowen," who I think is the best interviewer. He is so good at just very pointed original questions. So what advice would you have for me to improve on that prompt to have better results? The questions were fine. They're great. They're interesting enough, but they weren't like, "Holy, these are incredible." So I guess what advice would you give me in that example?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:22:57):
Yeah, that's a great example where thinking in context of who it is that you're asking questions about. I'm probably not somebody who has enough information about me on the internet where the model actually has been trained and knows the nuances of my background. I think there's probably much more famous guests where it might be that there's enough context on the internet to answer the questions. You actually have to do some of that work. You need to, say if you're using browse with Bing, for example, you could say, "Here's a link to Logan's blog and some of the things that he's talked about. Here's a link to his Twitter. Go through some of his tweets, go through some of his blogs and see what his interesting perspectives are that we might want to surface on the blog," or something like that.

(00:23:36):
It's, again, giving the model enough context to answer the question. I think, again, that prompt actually might work really well for somebody who has it, if you were interviewing Tom Cruise or something like that, somebody who has a lot of information about them on the internet. It probably works a little bit better.

Lenny (00:23:52):
So the advice there is just give more context. It doesn't tell you, "Hey, I don't actually know that much about Logan, so give me some more information." It's just like, "Here you go. Here's a bunch of good questions."

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:00):
Exactly. It wants to. It so deeply wants to answer your question. It doesn't care that it doesn't have enough context. It's the most eager person in the world you could imagine to answer the question, and without that context it's just hard to do, to give anything a value. If we got t-shirts printed, they should say, "Context is all you need. Context is the only thing that matters." It's such an important piece of getting a language model to do anything for you.

Lenny (00:24:26):
Any other tips? Just as people are sitting there, maybe they have ChatGPT open right now as they're crafting a prompt, is there anything else that you'd say would help them have better results?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:24:37):
We actually have a prompt engineering guide, which folks should go and check out. It has some of the examples. It depends on the order of magnitude of how much performance increase you can get. There's a lot of really small silly things, like adding a smiley face, increases the performance of the model. I'm sure folks have seen a lot of these silly examples, but telling the model to take a break and then answer the question, all these kinds of things. And again, if you think about it, it's because the corpus of information that's trained these models is the same things that humans have sent back and forth to each other. So you telling a human, "When I go take a break and then I come back to work, I'm fresher and I'm able to answer questions better and do work better," so very similar things are true for these models. And again, when I see a smiley face at the end of someone's message, I feel empowered that this is going to be a positive interaction and I should be more inclined to give them a great answer and spend more effort on the thing that they asked me for.

Lenny (00:25:34):
Wow, wait. So that's a real thing. If you had a smiley face, it might give you better results.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:25:39):
Again, it's like the challenge with all this stuff is it's very nuanced and it's also it's a small jump in performance. You could imagine on the order of one or 2%, which for a few sentence answer might not even be a discernible difference. Again, if you're generating an entire saga of texts, the smiley face could actually make a material difference for you, but for something small and textual it might not.

Lenny (00:26:03):
Okay, good tip. Amazing. Okay, we've talked about GPTs I think maybe might be helpful to describe what is this new thing that you guys launched, GPTs, and I'm curious just how it's going. This is a really big change and element of OpenAI now with this idea that you could build your own mini, and I'm almost explaining it, your mini open ChatGPT and then people can... I think you can pay for it. You can charge for your own GPT or is it all free right now?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:29):
It's ll free right now. It's all free.

Lenny (00:26:31):
Okay. In the future I imagine people will be able to charge. So there's this whole store now. Basically it's the whole app store that you guys have launched. How's it going? What's happening? What surprised you there? What should people know?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:26:42):
Yeah, it's going great, and again, historically the thing that you would have to do, let's say for example, you have a really cool ChatGPT use case, what you would have to do to share it with somebody else is actually go in and start the conversation with the model, prompt it to do the things that you wanted to, and then you would share that link with somebody else before the action has actually happened and be like, here now you can essentially finish this conversation with ChatGPT that I started.

(00:27:08):
So GPT kind of changes this where you take all that important context, you put it into the model to begin with, and then people can go and chat with essentially a custom version of ChatGPT. And the thing that's really interesting is you can upload files, you can give it custom instructions, you can add all these different tools. Like a code interpreter is built in, which allows you to do math. Essentially you have browsing built in, image generation built in. You can also, for more advanced use cases if you're a developer, you can connect it to external APIs so you can connect it to the Notion API or Gmail or all these different things, and have it actually take actions on your behalf.

(00:27:44):
So there's so many cool things that people are unlocking. And what's been most exciting to me, actually, is the non-developer persona is now empowered to go and solve these really, really, really more challenging problems by giving the model enough context on what that problem is to be able to solve it. Going back to context is all you need, this is very true in the context of GPTs, and if you give it enough context, you can solve much more interesting problems.

(00:28:11):
There's so many things that I'm excited about with this. I think monetization, when it comes to the store later this quarter, I think is going to be extremely exciting when people can get paid based on who's using their GPT. That's going to be a huge unlock and open a lot of people's eyes to the opportunity here. I also think continuing to push on making more capabilities accessible to GPTs for people who can't code is really exciting. Even for me as someone who is a software engineer, it's not super easy to connect the Notion API or the Gmail API to my GPT, and really I'd love to just be able to one click sign in with Gmail and then all of a sudden it's like my Gmail is accessible, or someone else can sign in with their Gmail and make it accessible. So I think over time all those types of things will come, but today it's really custom prompts is essentially one of the biggest value adds with GPTs.

Lenny (00:29:03):
Awesome. I have it pulled up here on different monitor and Canva has the top GPT currently, and I was trying to play with it as you're chatting just to see. I was going to make a big banner that said, "It's the context stupid," and it doesn't. I'm not doing something right, but I'm not paying that much attention to it because we're talking, but this is very cool. Just maybe a final question there. Is there a GPT that you saw someone built that was like, "Wow, that's amazing. That's so cool," something that surprised you? And I'll share one that was very cool, but is there anything that comes to mind when I ask that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:29:33):
I think my instinct is the Zapier. All of the stuff that Zapier has done with GPTs is the most useful stuff that you could imagine. You can go so far with what... And I don't know how it's packaged for Zapier's GPT right now, but you can actually, as a third party developer, integrate Zapier without knowing how to code into your GPT. So they're pushing a lot of this stuff, and then basically all 5,000 connections that are possible with Zapier today, you can bring into your GPT and essentially enable it to do anything. So I'm incredibly excited for Zapier and for people who are building with them so many things that you can unlock using that platform. So I think that's probably the most exciting thing to me for people who aren't developers.

Lenny (00:30:20):
Awesome. Zapier's always in there, getting in there connecting things.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:23):
Yeah, they're great.

Lenny (00:30:25):
So the one that I had in mind, so I had a buddy of mine, [inaudible 00:30:28], who's the CEO of a company called Runway built this thing called Universal Primer which helps you learn. It's described as, "Learn everything about anything," and basically, I think, it's kind of this Socratic method of helping you learn stuff. So it's like, "Explain how transformers work in LMs," and then it just kind goes through stuff and then asks you questions, I think, and helps you learn new concepts. And I think it's the number two education GPT.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:30:53):
I love that. [inaudible 00:30:53] is incredible, so...

Lenny (00:30:54):
Yes, it's true. Let me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished, on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why Product Four teams such as Atlassian, Carta and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails and documentation.

(00:31:23):
But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2X higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale.

(00:31:50):
Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.

(00:32:11):
I want to talk about just what it's like to work at OpenAI and how the product team operates and how the company operates. So you worked at... Your two previous companies were Apple and NASA, which are not known for moving fast. And now you're at OpenAI, which is known for moving very fast, maybe too fast for some people's taste, as we saw it with the whole board thing. And so what I'm curious is just what is it that OpenAI does so well that allows them to build and ship so quickly and at such a high bar? Is there a process or a way of working that you've seen that you think other companies should try to move more quickly and ship better stuff?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:32:48):
Yeah, there's so many interesting trade-offs and all of this tension around how quickly companies can move. I think for us, again, if you think about Apple as an example, if you think about NASA as an example, just older institutions, lots of... Over time, the tendency is things slow down. There's additional checks and balances that are put in place, which drags things down a little bit. So we're young and a new company, so we don't have a lot of that institutional legacy barriers that have been put in place.

(00:33:18):
I think the biggest thing, and there's a good Sam tweet somewhere in the ether about this from, I think, 2022 or something like that, but finding people who are high agency and work with urgency is one of the most... If I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to either get 50 people's different consensus, because you have people who you trust with high agency and they can just go and do the thing, I think, is one of the most... It is the most important thing, I'm pretty sure, if you were to distill it down.

(00:34:04):
And I see this in folks that I work with. Folks are so high agency. They see a problem and they go and tackle it. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that I think traditional companies are stuck behind because they're like, "Oh, let's check with all these seven different departments to try to get feedback on this." People just go and do it and solve the problem. And I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.

Lenny (00:34:35):
That is so cool. I really like these two characteristics because I haven't heard this before. Those are the two, maybe the two most important things you guys look for, high agency, high urgency. To give people a clear sense of what these actually look like when you're hiring, you shared maybe this example of customer service. Someone's hearing a bug and then going to fix it. Is there anything else that can illustrate what that looks like, high agency? And then a similar question on urgency other than just move, move, move, ship, ship, ship.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:35:01):
I think the assistants API that we released for dev day, we continue to get this feedback from developers that people wanted these higher levels of abstraction on top of our existing APIs, and a bunch of folks on the team just came together and were like, "Hey, let's put together what the plan would look like to build something like this," And then very quickly came together and actually built the actual API that now powers so many people's assistant applications that are out there. And I think that's a great example of it wasn't this top down, oh, someone's sitting there being like, "Oh, let's do these five things," and then like, "Okay, team, go and do that." It's like people really seeing these problems that are coming up and knowing that they can come together as a team and solve these problems really quickly. And I think the assistants API, and there's like 1,001 other examples of teams taking agency and doing this, but I think that's a great one at the top of my head

Lenny (00:35:55):
That makes me want to ask. Just how does planning work at OpenAI? So in this example is just like, "Hey, we think we need to build this. Let's just go and build it." I imagine there's still a roadmap and priorities and goals and things that that team had. How does road mapping and prioritization and all of that generally work to allow for something like that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:36:14):
I think this is one of the more challenging pieces at OpenAI. There's so many. Everyone wants everything from us, and today, especially, in the world of ChatGPT and how large and well-used our API is, people will just come to us and say, "Hey, we want all of these things." I think there's a bunch of core guiding principles that we look at. One, going back to the mission, is this actually going to help us get to AGI? So there's a huge focus on there's this potential shiny reward right in front of us, which is optimize user engagement, or whatever it is. And is that really the thing? Maybe the answer is yes. Maybe that is what is going to help us get to AGI sooner, but looking at it through that lens I think is always the first step of deciding any of these problems.

(00:37:03):
I think, on the developer side, there's also these core tenets of reliability like, "Hey, it would be awesome if we had additional APIs that did all these cool things like new endpoints, new modalities, new abstractions, but are we giving customers a robust and reliable experience on our API?" And that's often the first question. And I think there have been times where we've fallen short on that, and there was a bunch of other things that we've been thinking about doing and really bringing the focus and priority back to that reliability piece because, at the end of the day, nobody cares if you have something great if they can't use it robust and reliably.

(00:37:37):
So there's these core tenets. And I think, again, we have very, other than all the principles about how we're making the decision, I think the actual planning process is pretty standard. We come together. There's H1 Q1 goals. We all sprint on those. I think the real interesting thing is how stuff changes over time. You think we're going to do these very high level things and new models, new modalities, whatever it is. And then as time goes on, there's all of this turmoil and change, and it's interesting to have mechanisms to be like, "Hey, how do we update our understanding of the world and our goals as everything the ground changes underneath of us as is happening in the craziness of the AI space today?"

Lenny (00:38:22):
It's interesting that it sounds a lot like most other companies. There's H1 planning. There's Q1 planning. Are there metrics and goals like that that you guys have OKRs or anything like that? Or is it just, Here we're going to launch these products?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:38:33):
I think it's much higher level. I actually don't think OpenAI is a big OKR company. I don't think teams do OKRs today and I don't have a good understanding of why that's the case, whether or not. I don't even know if OKRs are still the industry. You're probably talking to a lot more folks about who are making those decisions. So I'm curious. Is that something that you're seeing from folks? Is it still common for people to do OKRs?

Lenny (00:38:55):
Yeah, absolutely. Many companies use OKRs, love OKRs. Many companies hate OKRs. I'm not surprised that OpenAI is not an OKR driven company. Along those lines, I don't know how much you can share about all this stuff, but how do you measure success for things that you launch? I know there's this ultimate goal, AGI. Is there some way to track we're getting closer? What else do you guys look at when you launch, say DPT Store or assistants or anything that's like, "Cool, that was exactly what we're hoping for." Is it just adoption?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:39:20):
Yeah, adoption is a great one. I think there's a bunch of metrics around revenue, number of developers that are building on our platform, all those things. And a lot of these, and I don't want to dive... I'll let Sam or someone else on our leadership team go more into details, but I think a lot of these are actual abstractions towards something else. Even if revenue is a goal, it's like revenue is not actually the goal. Revenue is a proxy for getting more compute, which is then actually what helps us get towards getting more GPUs so that we can train better models and actually get to the goal. So there's all these intermediate layers where even if we say something is the goal, and you hear that in a vacuum and you're like, "Oh, well OpenAI just wants to make money," and it's like, "Well, really money is the mechanism to get better models so that we can achieve our mission." And I think there's a bunch of interesting angles like that as well.

Lenny (00:40:12):
I don't know if I've heard of a more ambitious vision for a company, to build artificial general intelligence. I love that. I imagine many companies are like, "What's our version of that?" Before we leave this topic, is there anything else that you've seen OpenAI do really well that allows it to move this fast and be this successful? You talked about hiring people with higher agency and high urgency. Is there anything else that's just like, "Oh wow, that's a really good way of operating?" I imagine part of it's just hiring incredibly smart people. I think that's probably an unsaid thing, but yeah, anything else?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:40:45):
I think there's a non-trivial benefit to using Slack, and I think maybe that's controversial and maybe some people don't like Slack, but OpenAI has such a slack heavy culture and it really... The instantaneous real time communication on Slack is so crucial. And I just love being able to tag in different people from different teams and get everybody coalesced. So everybody is always on Slack, so even if you're remote or you're on a different team or in a different office, so much of the company culture is ingrained in Slack, and it allows us to really quickly coordinate where it's actually faster to send someone a Slack message sometimes than it would be to walk over to their desk because they're on Slack and they're going to be using it.

(00:41:27):
And I saw, if you saw, the recent Sam and Bill Gates interview, but Sam was talking about how Slack is his number one most used app on his phone and, "I don't even look at the time thing on my phone anymore because I don't want to know how long I'm using Slack," but I'm sure the Salesforce people are looking at the numbers and they're like, "This is exactly what we wanted."

Lenny (00:41:46):
I also love Slack. I'm a big promoter Slack. I think there's a lot of Slack hate, but such a good product. I've tried so many alternatives and nothing compares. I think what's interesting about Slack for you guys is one of the... You don't know if someone in there is just an AGI, that is not actually a person that's just there working at the company.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:01):
I know there are real people. There is no AGIs yet. But I think, yeah, even Slack is building a bunch of really cool AI tools, which I'm excited to... And that's why there's so much cool AI progress. And at the end of the day, it's so exciting, from being a consumer of all these new AI products. Google's a great example. I'm so happy that Google is doing really cool AI stuff because I'm a Google Docs customer and I love using Google Docs. I like a bunch of their other products, and it's awesome that people are building such useful things around these models.

Lenny (00:42:33):
How big is the OpenAI team at this point, whatever you can share? Just to give people a sense of the scale.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:42:38):
Yeah, I think the last public number was something around like 750 near the end of last year, 780 or something like that near the end of last year. And we're still growing so quickly, so I won't be the messenger to share the specific updated numbers, but the team is growing like crazy and we're also hiring across all of our engineering teams and PM teams, so folks who are interested, would love to hear from folks who are curious about joining.

Lenny (00:43:03):
Maybe one last question here. So you're growing, maybe getting to 1,000 people, clearly still very innovative and moving incredibly fast. Is there anything you've seen about what OpenAI does well to enable innovation and not slow down new big ideas?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:43:19):
Yeah, there's a couple of things, one of which is the actual research team, who seed most of the innovation that happens at OpenAI, is intentionally small. Most of the growth that OpenAI has seen is around our customer facing roles, our engineering roles to provide the infrastructure for ChatGPT and things like that. The research team is, again, intentionally kept small and there's all of this talk. And it's really interesting. I just saw this thread from one of our research folks who was talking about how in a world where you're constrained by the amount of GPU capacity that you have as a researcher, which is the case for open AI researchers, but also researchers everywhere else, each new researcher that you add is actually a net productivity loss for the research group unless that person is up-leveling everyone else in such a profound way that it increases the efficiency.

(00:44:12):
If you just add somebody who's going to go and tackle some completely different research direction, you now have to share your GPUs with that person and everyone else is now slower on their experiments. So it's a really interesting trade-off that research folks have that I don't think product folks... If I add another engineer to our API team or to some of the ChatGPT teams, you can actually write more code and do more. And that's actually a net beneficial improvement for everybody. And that's always not the case in the case of researchers, which is interesting, in A GPU constrained world, which hopefully we won't always be in.

Lenny (00:44:46):
I want to zoom out a bit and then there's going to be a couple follow-up questions here. Where are things heading with OpenAI? What's in the near future of what people should expect from the tools that you guys are going to have in launch?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:44:58):
Yeah, new modalities. I think ChatGPT continuing to push all of the different experiences that are going to be possible. Today, ChatGPT is really just text in, text out or, I guess three months ago, it was just text in, text out. We started to change that with now you can do the voice mode and now you can generate images and now you can take pictures. So I think continuing to expand the way in which you interface with AI through ChatGPT is coming.

(00:45:24):
I think GPTs is our first step towards the agent future. Again, today when you use A GPT, it's really you send a message, you get an answer back almost right away, and that's kind of the end of your interaction. I think as GPTs continue to get more robust, you'll actually be able to say, "Hey, go and do this thing and just let me know when you're done. I don't need the answer right now. I want you to really spend time and be thoughtful about this."

(00:45:48):
And again, if you think back to all these human analogies, that's what we do as humans. I don't expect somebody, when I ask them to do something meaningful for me, to do it right away and give me the answer back right away. So I think pushing more towards those experiences is what is going to unlock so much more value for people.

(00:46:06):
And I think the last thing is GPTs as this mechanism to get the next few hundred million people into ChatGPT and into AI. So I think if you've had conversations with people who aren't close to the AI space, oftentimes you talk about, even if they've heard of ChatGPT... A lot of people haven't heard of ChatGPT, but if they have, they show up in ChatGPT and they're like, "I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with this blank slate. I can kind of do anything. It's not super clear how this solves my specific problem."

(00:46:35):
But I think the cool thing about GPTs is you can package down like, "Here's this one very specific problem that AI can solve for you and do it really well," and I can share that experience with you and now you can go and try that GPT, have it actually solve the problem and be like, "Wow, it did this thing for me. I should probably spend the time to investigate these five other problems that I have to see if AI can also be a solution to those." So I think so many more people are going to come online and start using these tools because very narrow vertical tools are what's going to be a huge unlock for them.

Lenny (00:47:07):
So in that last case, a classic horizontal product problem where it does so many things and people don't know what exactly it should do for them. So that makes a ton of sense. Just being a lot more template oriented, use case specific, helping people onboard makes tons of sense. A common problem for so many SaaS products out there. The other ones you mentioned, which was really interesting, basically more interfaces to more easily interact with OpenAI voice. You mentioned audio and things like that. That makes tons of sense. And then this agents piece where the idea is, instead of just it's a chat, it's like, "Hey, go do this thing for me."

(00:47:42):
Kind of along those lines, GPT-5, we touched on this a bit. There's a lot of speculation about the much better version. People just have these wild expectations, I think, for where GPT is going. GPT-5 is going to solve all the world's problems. I know you're not going to tell me when it's launching and what it's going to do, but I heard from a friend that there's kind of this tip that when you're building products today, you should build towards a GPT-5 future, not based on limitations of GPT-4 today. So to help people do that, what should people think about that might be better in a world of GPT-5? Is it just faster? It's just smarter? Is there anything else that might be like, "Oh wow, I should really rethink how I'm approaching my product?"

Logan Kilpatrick (00:48:22):
If folks have looked through the GPT-4 technical report that we released back in March when GPT-4 came out, GPT-4 was the first model that we trained where we could reliably predict the capabilities of that model beforehand based on the amount of computes that we were going to put into it. We did a scientific study to show like, "Hey, this is what we predicted and here is what the actual outcome was." So it'll be, one I think, just as somebody who's interested in technology, but interesting to see does that continue to hold for GPT-5, and hopefully we'll some of that information whenever that model comes out.

(00:48:56):
I also think you can probably draw a few observations. One of them, which is GPT-4 came out. The consensus from the world is, "Everything is different. All of a sudden everything is different. This changes the world. This changes everything." And then slowly but surely, we come back to reality of like, "This is a really effective tool and it's going to help solve my problems more effectively."

(00:49:21):
And I think that is the, undoubtedly, the lens in which people should look at all of these model advancements, like GPT-5 is surely going to be extremely useful and solve some whole new echelon of problems. Hopefully it'll be faster. Hopefully It'll be better in all these ways, but fundamentally, the same problems that exists in the world are still going to be the same problems. You now just have a better tool to solve those problems.

(00:49:44):
And I think going back to vertical use cases, I think people who are solving very specific use cases are just now going to be able to do that much more effectively. I don't think that's going to... People have these unrealistic expectations that GPT-5 is going to be doing back flips in the background in my bedroom while it also writes all my code for me and talks on the phone with my mom or something like that.

(00:50:06):
I'm like, "That's not the case." It's just going to be this very effective tool, very similar to GPT-4, and it's also going to be become very normal very quickly. And I think that is actually a really interesting piece. If you can plan for the world where people become very used to these tools very quickly, I actually think that's an edge, and assuming that this thing is going to absolutely change everything, and in many ways I think it's actually a downside, is the wrong mental framing to have of these tools as they come out.

Lenny (00:50:39):
Kind of along these lines, you guys are investing a lot into B2B offerings. I think half the revenue, last I heard, was B2B and then half is B2C. I don't know if that's true, but that's something I heard. What is it that you get if you work with opening AI as a company, as a business? What does it unlock? Is it just called OpenAI Enterprise? What's it called and what do you get as a part of that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:51:01):
Yeah, so I think a lot of our B2B customers are using the API to build stuff. So I think that's one angle of it. I think if you're a ChatGPT B2B customer, we sell Teams, which is the ability to get multiple subscriptions of ChatGPT packaged together. We also have an enterprise version of ChatGPT. There's a bunch of enterprise-y things that enterprise companies want, around SSO and stuff like that, related to ChatGPT Enterprise.

(00:51:25):
I think the coolest thing is actually being able to share some of these prompt templates and GPTs internally. So again, you can make custom things that work really well for your company with all of the information that's relevant to solving problems at your company and share those internally. And to me, that's like you want to be able to collaborate with your teammates on the cool things you create using AI. So that's a huge unlock for companies. I think that those are the two biggest value adds. There's higher limits and stuff like that on some of those models, but I think being able to share your very domain specific applications is the most useful thing.

Lenny (00:52:00):
I think if you're a company listening and you think a lot of employees are using ChatGPT, basically the simplest thing you could do is just roll it up into a business account with single sign-on and that probably saves you money and makes it easier to coordinate and administer.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:14):
Yeah, there's also a bunch of security stuff too, like if you want to control. You don't want people to use certain GPTs from the GPT store because you're worried about security or privacy and stuff like that. You don't want your private data going in places. It makes a lot of sense to sign up for that so that you have a little bit more control over what's happening.

Lenny (00:52:29):
Okay, got it. There's a launch happening tomorrow, I think, after we're recording this. Can you talk about what is new, what's coming out? I think this is going to come out a couple weeks after recording, but just what should people know that's new that's coming out from OpenAI tomorrow in our world?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:52:45):
Yeah, updated, so there's a few different things. A couple of quick ones are updated GPT-4 Turbo model, updated the preview model that we released that dev day. There's an updated version of that. It fixes this, if folks have seen online people talking about this sort of laziness phenomenon in the model. We improve on that and it fixes a lot of the cases where that was the case. So hopefully the model will be a little bit less lazy. The big thing is the third generation embeddings model. So we were talking off-camera before recording about all of the cool use cases for embedding. So if folks have used embeddings before, it's essentially the technology that powers many of these question and answering with your own documentation or your own corpus of knowledge. And like you were saying, you actually have a website where people can ask questions about recordings of the podcast.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Lennybot.com. Check it out.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:53:35):
Yeah, lennybot.com. And my assumption was that lennybot.com is actually powered by embedding. So you take all of the corpus of knowledge. You take all the recordings, your blog post. You embed them, and then when people ask questions, you can actually go in and see the similarity between the question and the corpus of knowledge and then provide an answer to somebody's question and reference an empirical fact, something that's true from your knowledge base. And this is super useful and people are doing a ton of this. It's like trying to ground these models in reality, in what they know to be true. We know all the things from your podcast to be at least something that you've said before and to be true in that sense, and we can bring them into the answer that the model is actually generating in response to a question. So that'll be super cool.

(00:54:20):
And these new V3 embeddings models, again, state-of-the-art performance, the cool thing is actually the non-English performance has increased super significantly. I think historically, people really were only using embeddings for... It only worked really well for English, and I think now you can use it across so many new languages because it's just so much more performant across those languages and it's five times cheaper as well, which is wonderful. There's no better feeling than making things cheaper for people. I love it. I think now it's like you can embed, I'm pretty sure, it was like 62,000 pages of text for $1, which is very, very cheap. So lots of really cool things that you can do with embeddings and exciting to see people invent more stuff.

Lenny (00:55:07):
What a deal. Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Say you're a product manager at a big company, or even a founder, what do you think are the biggest opportunities for them to leverage the tech that you guys are building, GPT-4, all the other APIs? How should people be thinking about, "Here's how we should really think about leveraging this power in our existing product," or new product, whichever direction you want to go.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:55:34):
Yeah, I think going back to this theme of new experiences is really exciting to me. I think consumers are just going to be... You are going to have an edge on other people if you're providing AI that's not accessible in a Chatbot. People are using a ton of chat and it's a really valuable service area. It's clearly valuable because people are using it. But I think products that move beyond this chat interface really are going to have such an advantage. And also, thinking about how to take your use case to the next level. I've tried a ton of chat examples that are very, very basic and providing a little bit of value to me, but I'm like, "Really this should go much further and actually build your core experience from the ground up."

(00:56:20):
I've used this product that allows you to essentially manage or view the conversations that are happening online around certain topics and stuff like that. So I can go and look online. What are people saying about GPT-4? And what I just said out loud, "What are people saying about GPT-4," is the actual question that I have. And in a normal product experience today, I have to go into a bunch of dashboards and change a bunch of filters and stuff like that. And what I really want is just ask my question. What are people doing? What are people saying about GPT-4? Get an answer to that question in a very data grounded way.

(00:56:55):
And I've seen people solve part of this problem where, oh, they'll be like, "Oh, well here's a few examples of what people are saying and, well, that's not really what I want. I want this summary of what's happening." And I think it just takes a little bit more engineering effort to make that happen. But I think it's like that is the magical unlock of like, "Wow, this is an incredible product that I'm going to continue to use," instead of like, "Yeah, this is kind of useful, but I really want more."

Lenny (00:57:21):
Awesome. I'll give a shout-out to a product. I'm not an investor, but I know the founder, called visualelectric.com, which I think is doing exactly this. It's basically a tool specifically built for creatives, I think specifically graphic design, to help them create imagery. So there's like Dali, obviously, but this takes it to a whole new level where it's kind of this canvas, infinite canvas, that you could just generate images, edit, tweak them, and continue to rate until you have the thing that you need. Visualelectric.com.

Logan Kilpatrick (00:57:48):
I'm going to try that out. Is it similar to Canva?

Lenny (00:57:50):
It's even more niche, I think, for more sophisticated graphic design, I think, is the use case. But I'm not a designer, so I'm not the target customer. But I will say my wife is a graphic designer. She had never used AI tools. I showed her this and she got hooked on it. She paid for it without even telling me that she was going to become a paid customer, and she created imagery of our dog and all this art. And now it's like on our TV. The art she created is now sitting... It's like we have a frame TV, and that's the image on our TV. So anyway...

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:21):
I love that. What was it called again?

Lenny (00:58:23):
Visualelectric.com. Anyway, anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:58:31):
I've made this statement a few times online and other places, but for people who have cool ideas that they should build with AI, this is the moment. There are so many cool things that need to be built for the world using AI. And again, if I or other folks on the team at OpenAI can be helpful in getting you over the hump of starting that journey of building something really cool, please reach out. The world needs more cool solutions using these tools, and would love to hear about the awesome stuff that people are building.

Lenny (00:59:01):
I would've asked you this at the end, but how would people reach out? What's the best way to actually do that?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:06):
Twitter, LinkedIn. My email should be findable somewhere. I don't want to say it and then get slammed with a bunch of email. You should be able to sign my email, if you need it, online somewhere. But yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn is usually the easiest place.

Lenny (00:59:18):
And how do they find you on Twitter?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:21):
It's just Logan Kilpatrick, or I think my name shows up as Logan.GPT or-

Lenny (00:59:21):
Logan.GPT?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:26):
Or official Logan K.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Yeah. Awesome. Okay. And we'll link into it in the show notes. Amazing. Well Logan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Logan Kilpatrick (00:59:39):
I think the first one is one that I read a long time ago and came back to recently, is the One Room Schoolhouse by Sal Khan. Incredible. Yeah, I don't want... It's the lightning round so I won't say too much, but incredible story and AI is what is going to enable Sal Khan's vision of a teacher per student to actually happen. So I'm really excited about that. And the other one is, that I always come back to, is Why We Sleep. Sleep science are so cool. If you don't care about your sleep, it's one of the biggest up-levels that you can do for yourself.

Lenny (01:00:14):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:00:18):
I'm a sucker for a good inspirational human story. So I watched, with my family recently over the holidays, this Gran Turismo movie, and it's a story about someone who, a kid from London, who grew up doing SIM racing, which is a virtual race car, and did this competition, ended up becoming a real professional race car driver through some competition. And it's just really cool to see someone go from driving a virtual car to driving a real car and competing in the 24-hour Le Mans and all that stuff.

Lenny (01:00:50):
I used to play that game and it was a lot of fun, but I don't think I have any clue how to drive a real car, race car. So that's inspiring. Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:03):
Yeah, I'm always curious to hear what people's... The thing that they so strongly believe that people disagree with them on.

Lenny (01:01:12):
What do you look for in an answer that seems like, Wow, that's a really good signal?"

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:17):
Oftentimes, it's just an entertaining question to ask in some sense, but it's also... It's interesting to see what somebody's deeply held strong belief is, I think. And not to judge whether or not I believe in that, but just curious to see why people feel that way.

Lenny (01:01:35):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:01:38):
On the narrative of sleep, I have this really nice sleep mask from this company called... Not being paid. I just say this, but it's called Manta Sleep or something like that. It's a weighted sleep mask and it feels incredible when I... I don't know. Maybe I just have a heavy head or something like that, but it feels good to wear a weighted sleep mask at night. I really appreciate it.

Lenny (01:02:01):
I have a competing sleep mask that I highly recommend. I'm trying to find it. I've emailed people about it a couple of times in my newsletter for gift guides.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:09):
Okay. My favorite is called the Waoaw Sleep Mask, W-A-O-A-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:15):
What do you like about it?

Lenny (01:02:16):
W-A-O-A-W. I'll link to it in the show notes. It makes a lot of room. It's very large and there's space for your eyes, so your eyelashes and whatever eyes aren't pressed on, and it just fits really nicely around the head. And my wife, we both wear eye masks at night. It just, speaking of sleep, really helps us sleep. [inaudible 01:02:37] It doesn't have the weight-ness piece, so it might be worth trying, but everyone I've recommended this to is like, "That changed my life. Thank you for helping me sleep better." And so we'll link to [inaudible 01:02:51].

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:17):
Look at that.

Lenny (01:02:50):
Look at us. So adult. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:02:58):
Yeah, I've got it. It's on a Post-It note that I... Right behind my camera and it's "Measure in hundreds." I love this idea of measuring things in hundreds, and it's for folks who are at the beginning of some journey. I talk to people all the time, they're like, "Yeah, I've tried this thing and it hasn't worked." And if your mental model is to measure in hundreds, "I measure in hundreds," the five times that you failed at something, you failed and tried zero times. And I love that. It's such a great reminder that everything in life is built on compounding and multiple attempts at stuff. And if you don't try enough times, you're never going to be successful at it.

Lenny (01:03:38):
I love that. I could see why you are successful at OpenAI and why you're a good fit there. Final question. So I asked ChatGPT for a very silly question. "Give me a bunch of silly questions to ask Logan Kilpatrick, head of developer relations at OpenAI," and I went through a bunch. I have three here, but I'm going to pick one. If an AI started doing standup comedy, what do you think would be its go-to joke or funny observation about humans?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:06):
I think today, I think if you were to do this, I think the go-to question would be something along the, "So an AI walks into a bar," and likely because, again, it's trained on some distribution of training data, and that's the most common joke that comes up, and that's probably... I wonder if you came up with a joke right now, whether or not that would show up in one of the examples.

Lenny (01:04:31):
I love it. What would be the joke though? We need the joke. We need the punchline. I'm just joking. I know you can't come up with amazing-

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:37):
That's what we have ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:04:41):
We're already irrelevant. Amazing. Logan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, even though you've already shared this information, but just for folks to remind them. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:04:55):
Yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn, Logan Kilpatrick or Logan.GPT on Twitter. Please shoot me messages. I get a ton of DMs from people and it's always really, really interesting stuff. I think the thing that I would love to have help on is if people find bugs and things that don't work well in ChatGPT, I oftentimes see people be like, "This thing didn't work really well." And the key, and I think we as OpenAI need to do a better job of messaging this to people, but having shared chats or actual, tangible, reproducible examples, are the two things that we need in order to actually fix the problems that people have. The model laziness was a good example where it was hard to figure out what was going on because people would be like, "Oh, the model's lazier," but it's hard to figure out what were the prompts they were using. What was the examples, all that stuff? So send those examples as you come up on things that don't work well and we'll make stuff better for you.

Lenny (01:05:49):
Amazing. And I'll also just remind people, if you're listening to this and you're like, "Oh, okay, cool. A lot of cool ideas for OpenAI and ChatGPT," what you need to do is actually just go to chat.openai.com and try this stuff out. There's a lot of just theorizing, but I think once you actually start doing it, you start to see things a little differently. And at this point, every day I'm in there doing something, like asking for ideas for questions, doing research on a newsletter post, and it's just a tab I'm always coming back to. And I know there's a lot of people just talking about this sort of thing, and I just want to remind people. Just go. Sign in. Play with it. Ask it questions on something you're working on and just see how it goes and keep coming back to it. Is there anything else you want to share along those lines to inspire people to give this a shot?

Logan Kilpatrick (01:06:34):
I love it. I think the phrase of people being worried about humans being replaced by AI, and I've seen this narrative online, that it's not AI that's going to replace humans. It's other humans that are being augmented and using AI tools that are going to be more competitive in a job market and stuff like that. So go and try these AI tools. This is the best time to learn. You're going to be more productive and empowered in your job and the things that you're excited about. So yeah, excited to see what people use ChatGPT for.

Lenny (01:07:01):
And then you can expense your account. I think it's 10 or 20 bucks a month. A lot of companies are paying for this for you, so ask your boss if you can just have it expensed and make sure you use the latest version. Anyway, Logan, thank you again so much for being here.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:16):
This is awesome, Lenny. Thanks for having me in. Thoughtful questions. Hopefully those weren't all from ChatGPT.

Lenny (01:07:20):
Nope, only the last one. I did have a bunch of others I had in the belt or in the pocket. I don't know what the metaphor is. In the back pocket, that's the metaphor, but I did not get to them because we had enough great stuff. So no, that was all me. Human AI.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:35):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:07:36):
Thanks, Logan.

Logan Kilpatrick (01:07:37):

## Transcript

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:00:00):
I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:00:33):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:01:18):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Lulu Meservey. I met Lulu while she was head of comms at Substack, where she was infamous for taking big risks and bold stands, and as a result creating a lot of attention for Substack, and other companies she's represented. Lulu is definitely the most innovative and interesting comms person I've worked with.

(00:01:46):
She's currently executive vice president of corporate affairs and chief communications officer at Activision Blizzard. And she writes what I'd say is the best newsletter on PR and comms strategy, a newsletter called Flack. In our conversation we get tactical about how to make your idea spread, cultural erogenous zones, the growing importance of going direct versus relying on traditional media. The importance of taking risks in your comms and much more. Lulu is so insightful, I could have continued to explore the subject for hours. Enjoy this episode with Lulu Meservey after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:21):
This episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale. What I love about AssemblyAI is you can use their simple API to access the latest AI breakthroughs from top tier research labs. They recently launched Conformer-1, the largest trained speech recognition model on the market which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. All of AssemblyAI's models, which are accessed through their API are production ready.

(00:02:54):
So many PMs I know are considering or already building with AI, and AssemblyAI is the fastest way to build with AI for audio use cases. Now is the time to check out AssemblyAI with their new Conformer-1 model available today, which makes it even easier to bring the highest accuracy transcription to your customers just like Spotify, CallRail and Writer do for theirs. Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground, that's assemblyai.com/lenny.

(00:03:28):
This episode is brought to you by Public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash, that is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high, but buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, and you can access your cash whenever you want even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield.

(00:04:10):
Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury account at public.com/lenny. Lulu welcome to the podcast.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:04:39):
Thank you Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:41):
I am really excited to chat all things comms and PR. I've never met a founder or product leader who doesn't want to get better at spreading ideas and getting their product out there, and you're very good at this. We're going to talk about some of the things you've done in the space. But just to start maybe just broadly I'm curious to hear just what have you learned about what helps an idea spread?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:05:03):
So there's a few ways to make the idea spread, the overall principle is you have to make it memorable and you have to make people want to say it of their own volition. And so what doesn't make them want to say it is doing a favor for a corporation. What does make them want to say it is they want to bring joy to somebody else, they want to make somebody laugh, they want to appear interesting, or they want to project some part of their identity. And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat. You can use an analogy, you can take something and just say it over and over, move fast and break things, don't be evil, build something people want.

(00:05:47):
You can create a mental image that is very colorful. So I have a mental image for people that I use a lot, which is put the pill in some cheese and we can talk about it later, it's about how to craft a story that will stick. But when I say put the pill in cheese, people tend to remember that and it's more easily repeatable. And then the last thing is use a story, use an anecdote instead of using adjectives because adjectives are so subjective, they're meaningless to people. So if you give them a story that's something they can repeat over the dinner table.

Lenny (00:06:17):
Do you have any examples of the frameworks you just shared? So you talked about maybe having an analogy or putting the pill in the cheese, which I think is referring to when you feed a dog a pill. You want to hide the pill in the cheese. Is there any stories or examples that come to mind of this in action either something you've done or other companies you've seen?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:06:34):
One example not for the better is binders of women. You remember when Mitt Romney said binders of women and it just absolutely caught on like wildfire, and it's because you can picture the binder, it's a hilarious mental image. You make lots of jokes about it. It's a very specific unusual phrasing that is very repeatable, and it lends itself so much to memeing. So it's not something that they wanted to have happen, which is a word of caution, this can backfire on you as well, but that's an example. I mentioned move fast and break things, software is eating the world, it's time to build. Those are these short phrases that take normal words and put them in an unusual order, and then especially if you repeat them a few times they just become very sticky.

Lenny (00:07:19):
These things sound really smart and wise after the fact, do you have any advice on just how to... So we're talking about coming up with a cool phrase that'll spread of how to do that. I don't know what have you seen work for coming up with move fast and break things, how would a founder approach that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:07:35):
You want to make it something that a second-grader could understand. You want to minimize the cognitive burden on the recipient. So it should be something where they're not having to expend any extra energy understanding the thing, where it immediately paints a picture. Or if you were to make a joke, it has to be a joke that they immediately get, or it's a very widely understood reference. You don't want it to be this inside joke with yourself that other people might get if you explain it to them. So if you were to boil down the essence of let's say your company or your mission, get it to one sentence and then turn it into a sentence that you could explain to a second-grader, and then cleanse it of all cliches and common parlance. And if you can then turn that into an analogy or if you can make it into something that has imagery, then you're probably 80, 90% of the way there.

Lenny (00:08:36):
So you've definitely done this on Twitter. It might be fun just to share a tweet or something of yours that has done this that has spread like crazy. I noticed you delete your old tweets, which I think is really smart and I should probably do that. So I couldn't find any examples, but I remember just being like, "Holy shit, it's got a bazillion views." Is there there an example that comes to mind that you could share? Just share something you put out that just went crazy.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:09:00):
I actually have a negative example too. I think it's useful to share my mistakes or missteps in addition to what went right, because there's more mistakes and missteps than what goes right. In general, you try a bunch of things every once in a while they succeed. But I think it's useful to think about what didn't land. And so one of mine was when you might remember this because this was the Substack era, when we were taking a lot of incoming for not censoring enough, and we took a stand that we want to encourage free expression. I was actually on maternity leave, so I was a little bit out of the loop, but I wanted to jump in there and support the cause. And so I did a thread about why we're standing by this principle even when it's hard, and the thread was pretty well received, it traveled a lot.

(00:09:53):
I think it was 30 something thousand likes among people that we cared about, people who write on the internet. And then there was one tweet in the thread where I said something like, "Doing this isn't pleasant, but neither for that matter is the sea." Completely esoteric reference, it was fresh in my mind because it was from a New Yorker book review where in that context it was poetic and evocative and beautiful. And I did the thing you're not supposed to do, which is take an inside joke with yourself and release it into the world.

(00:10:33):
And that one tweet was a dud in the middle of the thread where you could see the likes drop off precipitously and people were like, "What are you talking about?" And then afterwards I looked at it with fresh eyes, "Yeah, this makes no sense whatsoever out of a context." And also I'm not a New York book reviewer, so that was a good don't. But the fact that it was such a colorful metaphor actually caught people's attention in an accidental way. I didn't mean for it too. I guess that's a don't, does that serve as an example?

Lenny (00:11:08):
Yeah, that'll work and we'll go through other examples. But that's a good segue to something I was going to save for later, but it may be a good time to chat about is just something that you're big on is this concept of taking risks as a comms person, I think you have the sense that comms people are just very conservative, and there's a big opportunity to get a little out there. And in this case maybe it didn't work out, other times you have and it has. So just talk about that philosophy you have around taking risks.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:11:34):
I think if you're a startup your enemy is the status quo. And when you don't take risks, when you minimize risk by doing nothing, the best way to minimize risk is to do nothing. You're letting the status quo win. You're letting your greatest enemy and rival and threat to your business win by default, because you're not even going to try to compete. And so I always encourage people to try to make mistakes of commission rather than omission. Because if you make a mistake of commission you can observe it, you can learn from it. You know right away that it's happened. You can move really quickly and adapt and become better.

(00:12:11):
Whereas if you make mistakes of omission you're letting status quo win, you're not observing, you're not learning, and you're maybe not even noticing opportunities slip by. So the example that I use, again, an analogy to make it more memorable, my analogy for this is if you are investing money in the market versus if you're just sitting in cash. If you're sitting in cash you won't lose your money and it feels safe. But over time the world moves and the market grows, and everybody else is getting richer and you're getting poorer in real terms. Whereas if you make an investment it'll go up and down, there'll be some volatility. It's not just going to go up every day, but over the long run you'll be much, much better off.

Lenny (00:12:54):
Is there an example of something you did that you took a risk and it worked out, or you saw someone else do this really well?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:13:00):
The stand for free speech thread would be a risk that worked out. It was a risk because it was a topic that a lot of people were already mad about, which will happen with every topic that matters. It felt a little risky for me because I was on leave, I wasn't really in the middle of things. I was addled already, so I had at least one thing in there that was nonsensical. So there was the execution risk of would I'd be able to do this well.

(00:13:29):
There was also the risk of you poke your head up and make a thing where there wasn't a thing, and if that were to go wrong and embarrass the company or if that had made Chris or Hamish or Jerraj upset, that would've been upsetting to me and obviously a failure of my job. So that was a risk that I took and we took and they were supportive, and it did work out because the people who were most likely to write on Substack generally appreciate that stance.

(00:14:00):
I actually have one more for you Lenny when you asked about what are things that help stick in people's memory, there was the fail example of the sea analogy. I think a useful example that works is I often say to find your audience's cultural erogenous zones, and it is something that you immediately know what I'm talking about. If I say know your audience's cultural erogenous zones, you know what it means, it's a shorthand that everybody understands. It's not an inside joke with myself, and it's something that is unusual and upraising that you're going to repeat it and hopefully remember it, so there's one for you.

Lenny (00:14:40):
You told me about that framework and I definitely wanted to hear more about it. What does that mean and is there something that you've seen someone do that's just like, "Wow, they really nailed this erogenous zone approach."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:14:54):
Yeah, they really got it in the erogenous bull bullseye. So what it means is people have things that they either care about or don't, and you're not going to change that. So it's a huge lift to try to change someone's worldview or their passions. It's a light lift to take the thing you want to talk about and just shape it into, to fit into their worldview or their passions. There's not always a fit.

(00:15:26):
There's going to be people who are just not your natural audience, and you should know that and not waste your time. But if your natural audience cares about X and you're offering Y, then it's your job to create the API or to create the bridge from X to Y. With messaging, it's not build it and they will come. It is so hard and you'd have to be superhumanly gifted to the extent that I can't recall seeing in my entire life, where you create a message and a story so powerful that someone who didn't care at all before suddenly makes that their passion. It's so much easier to take what they're passionate about and understand it, and then convince them that if they care about that then they should care about your thing because of this connection.

Lenny (00:16:09):
This makes me think about one of the other tweets that I think went crazy, which is where you share the things you're muting on Twitter. Where it's like the threads thimble and the pointing down thing, and it feels like that's exactly that where people are just like, "Yep, this is me."

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:16:25):
Yeah, it is that. I have an example for you Lenny. The one that my mind goes to is when Kamala Harris was running for Senate. Put aside what anyone thinks of Kamala Harris as a politician or if you agree with her politics, it doesn't matter. When she was running for Senate, she had this example where not enough people care about K-12 education. It's not a sexy topic and only moms care about it, whereas people cared a lot and still do about national defense, national security.

(00:16:55):
And so she said the way to get their attention is you go to people who care about national security and you tell them, "Did you know that in order to enlist for the army you have to have a 10th grade reading level?" If you can't read at that level, you're not going to be able to read the army field manual. And so if you care about the future of national defense and being able to maintain a standing army, you need to care about middle grade reading standards. So that's a perfect example, and in fact it stuck with me such that many years later I'm still repeating it to you.

Lenny (00:17:28):
Something else that I think what you teach helps with is underdogs coming up against incumbent companies, giving them a chance to stand out. Like Substack I think is a good example where you just helped elevate Substack on the world stage in a lot of ways. What have you found works best for underdog startups and companies trying to get attention?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:17:49):
First, you have to acknowledge that you're the underdog, and you're not going to use the GE playbook from the 1980s or whatever. So acknowledging that means knowing that you're not going to play the game that requires you to have more resources, more and deeper relationships, and institutional backings, and to be able to draft off of the current narrative. So all of those things are going to be not in your favor. If you're a startup for example, by definition you're trying to disrupt something, you're trying to do something differently, you're fighting the status quo. And if that's the case then you can't rely on maybe the government, maybe mainstream media to support what you're doing. And so you should assume that you want to go with an approach that doesn't require a lot of money or people, that doesn't require that institutional backing and those relationships.

(00:18:40):
That means building your own distribution, which you can do starting from day one. You can start doing that before you even have the company. It means taking your story and winning hearts and minds. Number one, by making it a story that you shape to fit people's cultural erogenous zones of your audience. And number two, by finding the centers of gravity in society, like the influencers that are going to help spread it for you. Because you're not going to on day one call up the New York Times and get them to print the story that you want them to. So you need to figure out who are the influencers and the way to do that, I'll cut off the rabbit hole after this because you can just go deeper and deeper, but the way to do that is in concentric circles. There's a general who said if there's a problem I look for it in concentric circles going back to my own desk.

(00:19:33):
If you want to spread something you go out in concentric circles starting from your own desk. So you need to get first really clear with yourself about what your message is and just get really crisp with it. This is hard to do because you know too much, so out of the 1,000 facts in your head you're going to have to pick just between one and three. And then the next circle is going to be your co-founders, your executives, your employees, your investors, you go to your power users, and you go out from there, and it has to be in that sequence.

(00:20:06):
But once you get the sequence and you identify who the people are and you know who your audience is, and then you're able to hone in on what their cultural erogenous zones are, then you're able to craft the message, have the delivery mechanisms, and then know your target, and then you're off. But you just need to do that exercise upfront, so you don't have a lot of wasted motion.

Lenny (00:20:25):
I really like this concentric circle framework. I haven't heard this before. Just to make it a little more real is there something that you can share, something that comes to mind that illustrates that?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:20:36):
Well, you and I have talked a lot about Substack, so I'm speaking out of term now that I don't have the employee badge. But something that I thought the Substack founders have always done so well is propagate product updates out in concentric circles. So there's a lot of things where you're going to know about it. You, Lenny will know about it more than a new writer who just joined, because you're a power user of the product and they would want you... Now they would want to make sure that you love the thing, and that you feel maybe even a little bit invested in the thing. You've been telling people about recommendations for nearly a year. No one asked you to do that. We didn't pay you to do that. You've done it because you were brought on board early and it was something that the company made sure that you liked, and then you became the next circle out that spread it to your next circle out.

Lenny (00:21:33):
It's interesting because I didn't think of it as an intentional strategy to get news out, and it feels like there's a synergy with just talking to your power users. Getting feedback from your power users leads to this interesting second order effect where they also want to... they feel like they're on the inside of something, they want to share it and maybe talk about it and tell friends about, "Hey, Substack's working this cool thing." So that's kind of a cool-

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:21:53):
Well, early on Lenny you asked about how do you get a message to spread? And I said you give people incentives who want to spread it. So your incentive was you helping others, you like paying it forward and helping other writers and podcasters, and you genuinely enjoy the thing. And I think there's some value to your own project that you get to show social proof that a lot of people like this thing and it's growing, and that's what you got. If it had been like, "Hey, Lenny, can you do us a favor and tweet this thing?" You might've done it, but you would've done it once and stopped and it wouldn't have been something that you organically keep doing.

Lenny (00:22:30):
To make this even more real I'm trying to help people understand this concentric circle idea, so first Substack is an example. What would be the few layers of the concentric circle on the middle would be maybe the power writers. What would be the next couple layers?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:22:46):
It's the employees at the middle, almost always, and then it is depending on the company. So here it would be the power writers, it's youth, a lot of the original writers. Bill Bishop comes up a lot, he was Substacker number one, he's always really meaningful. And then it's fast growing writers. It is writer influencers. There are certain members of the media that cover media and writing, and so they matter a lot. And then investors are in there just to keep close to the fold.

(00:23:18):
But if you're a different kind of company that might be employees board, institutional investors, government and regulators then users, just depending on how much power each group has to influence your future. And the reason I say go out in concentric circles as opposed to just hit each of these groups kind of haphazardly is that's your way to control the message. Because each circle is going to assume that the inner circle knows better than them and they're going to follow the lead of the inner circle. So an example is if you and I have a company, Lenny and Lulu, this is a DTC startup.

Lenny (00:24:01):
That's a great name.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:02):
It is, we should do it.

Lenny (00:24:03):
We should do this.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:04):
If we had a company and we were trying to put out a message to the world that our new thing works, it's really revolutionary, our genes are the best genes. If employees are not saying that, then people are going to look at employees and say, "Well, they would know, they're closer to this than we are. So if they're not excited then why would we be excited?" And so that undermines everything that we're trying to do, you can't skip a circle is my point.

Lenny (00:24:32):
Super interesting. And I imagine the closer they are to the employees the more time you spend with them, and the more innately they're closer and also their perspective and what they share is more powerful because they're closer to what's happening.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:24:48):
And if it goes wrong the more damage they can do. So on the spectrum it's if they are not totally on board and they're not an effective messenger, versus they're just lukewarm and they're not really sure they believe it. All the way to they actively fell off the bandwagon and you lost them, and now they're out there proactively contradicting everything you say or even trying to destroy the company, that can happen. If an early employee, for example, feels disgruntled, which is easy to do and it's easy to do through a comms mistake. If you sell them on one thing and here's a vision, and now either that's changed or you miscommunicated. If they feel like there's a bait and switch they're going to be really mad. And now you've created someone who is incredibly credible and has the same social and professional circle as you and is trying to ruin you.

Lenny (00:25:44):
That's such a good point. For someone that's trying to do this maybe internally they're like, "Oh, cool, we got to create these circles for our startup." What do you recommend they do? Do they make a list of here's our inner circle, here's the next circle of people.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:25:56):
Yeah, you take out your one-page Google Doc. I feel like most comms problems can be solved with one-page Google Doc. So you go to your one-page Google Doc and you take your audiences, you list them, probably stop at five or six because past that it's like way, way first world problem. You'll have more than enough work to win over the five or six inner circles, and then you have to rank them. And you rank them by how much they're able to influence your success and how much credibility other groups assign them. So then you have your inner to outer circles.

(00:26:32):
And then for each of them you would think about what do they care about that's their cultural erogenous zones and where do they reside intellectually? So do they listen to podcasts, if so, which ones. Do they go to in-person conferences? Are they getting all of their news from Reddit? If so, which subreddits are they on Hacker News? Once you map that out, then again you have the people you're trying to reach, the ideas and messages that resonate the most with them, and then the ways to actually reach them.

Lenny (00:27:04):
This is becoming a real template we can start using. In the bucket of erogenous zones what are some examples of erogenous zones for people in this context?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:27:15):
We've talked about the free expression stand from last year. A lot of people care about first amendment, protecting press freedoms and free expression. Not a lot of people care that a journalist said something mean about Substack. And so there were a few times when we did have to push back publicly against a journalist saying something mean and unfair or untrue about Substack. So obviously my and our ulterior motive is to vindicate the company and show people that this isn't true. But if we had just done that, nobody would've cared or maybe a few diehards would've cared. There are people who care deeply about Substack, but not as many people and not as deeply as the people who care about their ability to express themselves freely or their right to build their own media platform without too many controls.

Lenny (00:28:20):
The way you described it earlier came back to me as you were talking, which is this idea that lights people up. What lights people up within this list of people that you're making? So that's really interesting. So the idea is create this list of people across circles further and further away from your employees. Think about what lights them up, what are their erogenous zones intellectually, and then think about where they spend their time intellectually, what are they listening to? What are they reading?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:44):
Yeah, that's it.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Amazing, this is super cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:28:47):
It's not easy, it's hard, you have to make very difficult tactical decisions every day when you're doing that, but it is simple.

Lenny (00:28:54):
Yeah, it seems pretty easy. Okay, this is great. Another framework that we haven't talked about yet, do you have this math formula for how ideas spread? Does that ring a bell?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:05):
Okay, let's get into that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:29:06):
I think it's useful to try to bring as much discipline as possible to comms, because you're really just measuring vibes. In a world of OKRs and data and metrics it's hard to know if you're doing the right thing with comms. And so I think whenever you're able to establish a framework its useful, so this one is kind of a mathematical formula of comms for a purpose. It assumes that you have a business goal and as a business goal, not communications goal, it's not get this many impressions or go viral or blah. It is we're going to grow our revenue by X, or we're going to make this penetration into this user base. When you have your business goal you're going to need certain people to do certain things for that goal to come true. So for example, you're going to need this type of person in this quantity to buy these sneakers in order for you to meet your revenue goal.

(00:30:07):
So now you know who the people are and the action they need to take. The next step is what do they need to believe in order to take that action? So they need to believe that their feet are not comfortable now, and that it's possible for their feet to be more comfortable and that'll have a positive effect on their life, and that this new sneaker technology is real, so they need to believe these things. Then it's where do they reside intellectually? How do you deliver that message to them, and that's the who do they listen to? Which accounts do they follow? Which podcast do they... what trips do they take? What newspapers, et cetera. And when you have that then you have the equation of we need to deliver this message to these people through these mediums in order to get them to do this thing with this call to action. And that way you know that you're at least pushing forward and getting something done with your comms as opposed to just saying words into the ether.

Lenny (00:31:11):
I think you had something like there's pressure and force and area, is that part of this or is that a different framework?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:17):
Different framework.

Lenny (00:31:18):
Oh, okay, cool.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:20):
Oh yeah.

Lenny (00:31:21):
Okay, okay, let's talk about this other framework too.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:24):
I've got more frameworks, Lenny.

Lenny (00:31:25):
I love it, this is what this podcast is all about. Let's do it.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:31:29):
This is a useful one for early stage startups especially, or anybody who's just trying to be lean and efficient, which is anyone who's an underdog like we talked about earlier, that if you decrease the surface area than with the same amount of force you can apply more pressure. So the amount of pressure is the force divided by the surface area, this is a basic equation for physics, but it's also true of communications, which is if you decrease the surface area and don't try to appeal to everybody with everything. And you're targeting exactly whom you're talking to and you are sharpening your message to a point, to get them in the bullseye of the cultural erogenous zone. Then you're able to with the same amount of effort or expense or time, you're able to make more of an impact, you're able to apply more pressure.

(00:32:30):
So I think of it as there's a continuum between you can either hyper-target, so the extreme of the continuum is you are becoming the life partner of one person. That's the ultra hyper targeting. And then the other end of the spectrum is you're appealing to everybody. You're appealing to a larger number of people, but with a weaker message, in a weaker way. So you could say world peace is good, nobody disagrees with that practically, but also it doesn't stick and it's not meaningful to them. So you have to choose where you're going to be along that continuum. And for most startups I would choose towards the fewer people end of it, where you choose who's going to be your diehards and then you foster them and create really deep meaningful relationships with them. And the way to do that is to decrease the surface area and apply more pressure.

Lenny (00:33:23):
It feels like you did that with Substack where it was focused on people writing online, or I guess tell me is that how you thought about it Substack of here's our little focused area and we'll focus target message to that.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:33:37):
That was the goal and that's actually why I started spending time on Twitter. It was a very self-loathing exercise like Hamish doesn't like the Twitter model, nor do, we would talk about this a lot and I always felt a little bit fringe being on there. And before I worked at Substack I had a sleepy account of a couple hundred followers that didn't do very much. And I realized that the people that we were trying to speak to are heavy Twitter users, whether it's media people or online writers. And so I decided I'm going to spend some time and try to build an audience and then that audience became leverage, for better or worse. I don't think we should measure people by their Twitter following, but the fact is that if you have more then journalists and writers take you a bit more seriously. And so if I was going to try to carry a message on behalf of the company, I felt like it would be more effective if I had more people.

Lenny (00:34:38):
And it worked. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.

(00:35:18):
Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups, it's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:35:56):
Going back to this formula, pressure equals force divided by area. Basically, to increase the effectiveness of your message you can either increase the force and what is in this context force? Is it like the amount of messaging or is it the success of your message?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:36:11):
It's the amount of effort you put into it. So it's how much you are spending on this campaign or you have a limited amount of hours in the day and dollars in the bank. And so anytime you're doing something with comms, you're either paying the dollars or you're paying the time. Sometimes you're drawing down on credibility too, you have a certain amount of credibility and there are times when you just have to say, "Please trust me." You can spend that more efficiently if you focus. So instead of if you just take a simple ad campaign, instead of spending a million dollars to reach a million people, maybe you spend a $100 to reach the hundred most important people. And focus that message exactly to them so that when they see your ad they're actually going to click on it and they're actually going to forward it, and that's a much better return. And then you might end up with a million dollars worth of return, because those people were so passionate that they then became their own messengers without you even having to be involved anymore.

Lenny (00:37:12):
This is a really great framework, again, is your advice that for the smaller you are just basically reduce the area?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:21):
Yes.

Lenny (00:37:22):
And the larger you are increase that over time?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:37:24):
Yes. If you're just starting out, get 10 diehards and just spend all your time... You can't start out and try to win over the general public. You start out by creating a tiny, not the best analogy is one I can think of right now, a tiny monopoly. And it's the same like succeeding on Substack or creating anything on the internet. You choose what is going to be your tiny corner of the internet that you are going to just dominate entirely. And the smaller it is, the more you can dominate it and then these people that are in it become your true believers, your diehards, and they'll expand it out to the next circle and then you go from there. But if you try to win over everybody at the same time, it's a food coloring in the ocean kind of thing as opposed to food coloring in a cup.

Lenny (00:38:17):
Is there an example that comes to mind of someone that did this really well? I don't know. I know it's hard to think of just an example off the top of your head, but does anything come to mind?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:38:25):
Balaji did this really well with his book The Network State, that book was super successful. He didn't do a lot of the traditional book tour New York Times stuff. He went his own route, and I think that was really smart if you're going to put it in the setting of this framework, it's he created his own distribution channels. He didn't try to compete with the roster of Harper Collins on their turf, and when he created his own distribution channels he focuses on who are the diehards and the truth fans, and these are people that he fosters. He goes on podcasts that reach these people. He doesn't deviate from messaging to try to appeal to everybody. There are people who just will never like that guy and he is totally fine with it. So he's not watering down who he is to appeal to people who will never like him, which it's tempting for companies to do.

(00:39:17):
You hate when people are mad at you, so you try to appeal to them and then your true fans lose their passion because the thing that made you so special has now gone milk toast. So Balaji fosters his true fans and then when the book launched they propelled him to the top of the Amazon list, because they were out there evangelizing, proselytizing. You probably saw all these tweets about his book. He didn't pay anybody as far as I know. He didn't pay anybody to do that. He just shared it with the people and they wanted to show that they were into this.

Lenny (00:39:46):
That's a great example. I know that founders often worry focusing too narrowly limits their market, and it's never going to grow into anything large. In your experience do you find that that's just often not true, that there's often a much bigger opportunity than they think? Or is that just a good way to start and then you expand from there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:40:03):
It's both. If you're writing online or doing something online, the denominator is the size of the internet. You don't need to capture 80% of it. If you capture 0.01% of it, that is a great business and then you can go from there. Once you've won that then you can decide to go from there and the world is a big place. So now that everything's digital the denominator's so large that I wouldn't worry too much about the numerator. But it is also true that if you start off trying to peel to too many people, you have to water down your stuff so much that you'll never stand out. And you've written about this Lenny with how to be viral, how to be noticed, and one of the things is be remarkable. And you can't be remarkable if you're trying to appeal to so many people that you have to become the average of 500,000 people's tastes.

Lenny (00:40:57):
This is a good way to think about I think when something's not working, when you're trying to get a bunch of attention for your product and no one cares. Feels like this is one reason is just you're going too wide.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:09):
Yeah, I think that's probably the most common reason.

Lenny (00:41:14):
Maybe just thinking about diagnosing why your comms may not be working. This may be too big of a question, but just what other explanations could there be for why no one cares about what you're trying to put out?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:41:25):
You're doing it as a corporation instead of a person. This is another super common mistake is you're letting yourself speak like a faceless corporation because it feels like that's what you should do now. Okay, now you're a real company and now you got to do real company stuff, that means you have to issue decrees on behalf of the C corp and you don't. And it doesn't work because people don't trust institutions. People don't like corporations or at least are not passionate about them. People care about people and trust and like people, and so there's a sense of wanting to cosplay an executive and it doesn't work, it doesn't resonate. A good example of this would be Ryan Peterson at Flexport. His company, even after it got huge, he never became the generic corporate chief. He always was a person. And there are people, many, many people who became interested in Flexport because Ryan's an interesting guy. And it's not like they had a passion for logistics and freight and shipping, but he's doing something interesting. And then he became the human gateway drug for people to become interested in his company.

Lenny (00:42:40):
Yeah, absolutely. He had that crazy viral tweet about the ports and that's a really good example. Man, I was going to go in a different direction, but maybe we go to this idea of going direct. You're a big fan and Balaji is a really big fan of this too, speaking of just the importance of going direct. So maybe just talk about what does that mean and why is that important these days?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:42:58):
Well, Balaji is more go direct than me. He thinks that I'm soft in this area because I think that there's still a place for engaging with media and that it's just another tool. He's for just straight-up go direct undistilled. But I think that for everybody a 100% of the time you want going direct to be a part of what you're doing, whether it's all you're doing, or whether you're doing something else, you can't not have a direct channel. So what that actually looks like, and people say this all the time go direct. What does that actually look like to go direct? It means that the founder or executive for some very senior person has to be speaking from themselves. First person, may be first person plural, and speaking in a human voice authentically. You see them make mistakes, you see them be vulnerable, and they have to become an ambassador to the community.

(00:43:55):
If you don't have that, then you don't have a direct channel even if you have a Twitter or a Substack or whatever, it's not direct if not connected to a person because if the other side of it is a corporation there's no direct connection. And then the second thing is start building your own audience as soon as possible. You can do this alongside engaging with the media or doing traditional things. To the point of focusing your energy and decreasing the surface area, for startups I would not recommend trying to do an Instagram, a Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok. I would choose the thing that that person is the best at. So if your spokesman is going to be your CEO, which is a good default, they're going to have a dominant communication style where they're the best at being themselves. And that's important because if somebody else is ghost-writing all their stuff, it shows.

(00:44:53):
So some CEOs are better at writing long form. Some CEOs are better at doing videos. Some do better with audio or podcasts, some are better with short form. The way that Elon Musk communicates on Twitter, he's born to do Twitter. You can't picture him writing long thoughtful blog posts, it's not a thing that he does. Whereas Brian Armstrong or Hamish or Chris, they write great blog posts that are sincere and effective, and that's better than them just trying to do it only through tweets. So pick the thing that your spokesperson is the best at and then invest everything into that channel, and then build it up to a decent amount and then expand outward. Because if you try to build six or seven channels at once you're just not going to get anywhere.

Lenny (00:45:47):
I think that's such a important point. I feel like me choosing a newsletter was actually a really good choice. As much as you may not believe this I'm not a performer person, I just want to hide behind the computer and just type stuff. And the newsletters, especially during COIVD, I was like, "I just sit at home and share stuff and edit and think about it where it's like, 'Hello everyone.'" And it took me a while to get to this point of like, "Oh, I can maybe do a podcast because I've built up a little more confidence that this is useful." So I so agree with that and that's what I tell a lot of people. Just pick the platform that is most natural to you. Maybe you like talking, maybe you performing on video, maybe you just want to sit and type.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:46:24):
And that's a good point too, Lenny, because it changes over time. Just because you pick one thing doesn't mean that you're stuck with only that forever. Over time you might choose different things and I've seen founders become a lot more comfortable in front of the camera, for example, once they've done a few reps. And the other reason to know that you can just change it over time is otherwise it feels like a deterrent to getting started. Sometimes there's paralysis if I don't know which thing to choose, and so I'm either going to do a bunch of them or none of them. Go with your gut pick one and you're not wed to that forever, you can always change it down the road.

Lenny (00:46:58):
Do you think every founder needs to be on Twitter? I get this a lot from founders. Do I need to be on Twitter? I hate Twitter. What's your take?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:47:04):
No, I think a lot of founders do. If they are super mission driven, for example, that's one way that you're going to find other people that resonate with your mission and that you're going to make the case for the mission. If you're mission driven there's also a good chance that you're doing something that some people love and some people hate. And so you're going to need to be out there fighting the fight in a way. I don't mean in a pugilistic antagonistic way, but you have to defend your thing. And so I think it's important if you're mission driven. I also think it's important if your charisma is a big part of recruiting for the company. There are some companies where the founder's charisma is a big part of why people want to go work there. So Palmer Lucky and Anduril, he is magnetic to a lot of engineers and they want to go work with that guy, specifically. Whereas there are companies where people want to go work for the company and it's less important that the founder is vocal.

Lenny (00:48:02):
What's interesting I found recently is I get more traffic to my newsletter from LinkedIn than Twitter. Is that something you think about at all? Going to LinkedIn instead of Twitter feels so wrong to say, but what's your take there?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:14):
Yes, if you are career related, LinkedIn will be a lot better. One, it's better because it's not such a cesspool where anything immediately becomes controversial and people fight over it in their mentions. Two, because LinkedIn is really underutilized and founders should know this, PMs should know this. LinkedIn is super underutilized because it gets a ton of eyeballs in time, but most of the content sucks. 95% of the content this is not scientific-

Lenny (00:48:49):
Seems right, seems right.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:48:50):
This is my might estimate. 95% of the content is people congratulating each other on work anniversaries or people saying, "I'm so proud of my team for this thing they did." And then people react out of a sense of friendship and affection or support, but actually genuinely interesting and useful content on LinkedIn is very rare. So the ratio of your competitive set of interesting content versus how much time and attention people spend on there is excellent.

Lenny (00:49:24):
That is really good advice. I'm going to throw a fishing line into the pool of examples. You talked about people doing this well, going direct. Balaji talking about Ryan Peterson and Elon obviously. Is there anyone else that's just like here check out what they're doing and could be a good model to learn from?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:49:41):
I think it's really interesting to see what Mike Solana is doing with Pirate Wires. Here's an example of why it clearly makes sense to have the founder be very active on Twitter because he is his own recruiter and spokesperson. So I think the makeup industry actually is at the forefront of this. The makeup industry is smarter than all of us in how they use social media and influencers, because they caught on very early on that people don't buy makeup to subscribe to makeup brands, that they do it because a certain celebrity or influencer or Kardashian has this nice looking eyelid and they want their eyelid to look that way.

(00:50:25):
And so going back years before the rest of us were talking about going direct, there are makeup companies that would spend $0 on marketing, and minimal efforts on press and pour all of it decreasing the surface area. Pour all of it into fostering a small roster of influencers and having them spread the message. And so I think watch makeup companies, watch consumer companies, they're doing it right, they speak with a human voice, they speak through human beings and they're fast. If there's a trend the same day they will have hopped on the trend... within an hour they're on the trend, as opposed to other industries or more traditional companies that take a few days and they route through approvals and then the opportunity's gone.

Lenny (00:51:11):
What are some makeup companies for people to check out to see what they're doing?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:51:14):
So NYX, N-Y-X, it's a division of L'Oreal. NYX is wanted the makeup companies that has, as far as I know $0 spent on marketing and all of their dollars and all of their effort spent on paying influencers. And they really out punched their weight in terms of using humans to deliver a message that contains a call to action and then selling out product. And the product will be like a normal black eyeliner. It's the most fungible thing you could possibly imagine, and that one eyeliner will be sold out at CBS's across the country for a couple weeks, because they did something right with their social media using a person.

Lenny (00:51:57):
Just a couple more questions around this going direct concept. I don't know if you actually talked about why that's important because I think we talk about this a lot, and I think people may not recognize why people find this so important these days. What's the motivation behind that with Balaji and other founders?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:52:14):
There's two reasons it's important, there's the offense and the defense of it. The defense of it is going back to having the underdog, the insurgency mentality. If you're trying to do something different that goes against the grain, people are going to attack you. Not everyone's going to like it. And the point is that not everyone should like it, but you need a way to stand up for yourself because you don't have the big institutions and power structures that are going to do that work for you because you're going against the grain. So if you're going to stand up for yourself there's only one way to do it, which is you do it. And so building the audience and the channels and you have to prime the market. By which I mean if you're a public company, you're priming the market by getting them used to how you convey information to them.

(00:52:58):
If you're a small startup or a founder, you're priming the market by making your audience aware of how you normally communicate, so that when you do something it's not weird. If you never post and then suddenly you start posting, people are going to think you're having a crisis or something like what is going on? They're going to try to read into it. So you have to already have the cadence and the relationships set up so that when you need to draw on them if you're under attack then you can, that's the defense of it. The offense of it is if you're doing something new and if you're mission driven, and if what you're doing is truly unique and innovative, no one else will be to tell that as well as you. The most friendly, sympathetic reporter on Earth could not tell that as well as you because they don't understand it as well as you, and so the onus just falls on you to do it.

Lenny (00:53:52):
If someone listening is like, "Yep, okay, I fully agree, time to do this." What do you suggest as a next step to starting to build an audience and going direct broadly.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:54:03):
Step one would be assessing what are you good at and what do you enjoy? So that's where you decide, do I like long form writing, or do I enjoy podcasting, or what are my mediums? Step two is setting up your account on those channels. So if you enjoy long form writing then you're going to have to choose, do you do a Substack, do you do Medium or whatever else? There's a objectively right answer on that one. But if you are doing short videos you're going to choose are you going to invest in Instagram, or you're going to invest in TikTok, you set that up. And then you start building your audience. And when you start if you're actually starting from zero, get some pipeline of talent ready. Sorry, not pipeline or talent, pipeline of content. Get it ready, it's the same way as if you're launching a Substack.

(00:54:54):
If you're launching a Substack you want to get a week or two of posts ready to go, so that out the gate you can build a lot of momentum. With different social networks it actually helps the algorithm if you come out the gate strong and are really regular. So TikTok, for example, if you're starting at TikTok with zero followers, you want to get a week or two of solid data just in the pipeline so you can hit it, hit it because the algorithm favors you right as you're starting out because they want you to keep going, so you want to ride that as much as possible. So that's step two is just get yourself ready for launch. Don't do one post and wait, get a bunch of posts ready and then boom, boom, boom. And then three is to have an ongoing content strategy, you know who you're going to reach, you know what they care about.

(00:55:42):
So you have to plan out, "Here's the cadence with which I'm going to talk to them. Here's how I'm going to do community management and respond to people, and here are the ways where I'm going to do announcements." And you get into a cadence because it's the same as growing a newsletter. The regularity and the consistency is a big part of growing. And so it's the same with audience. A mistake that people make I think is just every once in a while trying to go viral as opposed to just being consistent. And then some posts do better than others organically, but that's the way to do it. I don't live that. I'm not a good example because I'm so self-loathing about being on Twitter I will go away for one or two weeks and do nothing, and then I'll come in with a bunch of posts in one day. It's not a best practice. It's not the way you're supposed to do it. Ideally, you're just there every day saying something and then it builds over time.

Lenny (00:56:36):
I'm actually an example of trying to focus on consistent non-viral content and it's worked out.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:56:44):
It has worked out.

Lenny (00:56:46):
It's worked out. It's worked out so far, but it's interesting to see how different people act and how it's like I'm trying to go viral every tweet, every post and that is hard. And it's also just like people can tell you're just trying to create some viral thing and no one cares.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:57:00):
And it's very obvious when you're just trying to go viral for the sake of it and you don't have a real message. It's like the post when people screenshot the iPhone six digit security code and they say best feature apple's ever built. A few people did that, and now I've seen it probably dozens of times. And it doesn't even help to get you followers because that's not something where people say, "Only this person could uniquely give me this kind of content in the future." If you're going to get followers with a one-off joke, it has to be an incredibly hilarious one-off joke where they say, "This person is going to keep entertaining me." But with these kind of viral baits, I don't think it's even that effective.

Lenny (00:57:41):
And also what I find if something does go viral, whatever the correct term is and then life goes on, nothing's going to significantly... that's just one thing, and then you have to do it again and again. That's where people don't realize like, "Oh, I went viral. I'm done. My life is good now." Nothing's going to really change most often, and you have to do it again and again.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:58:03):
I think that's true. One thing that I've noticed about your audience, Lenny, is that it's the right audience. It's the people who find value in what you do, and they're in the right place and there's a match. Sometimes in the effort to just gain followers for the sake of it or a go viral for the sake of it, you end up with a mismatch of the audience. You had this viral hamster tweet, and now they're all here expecting hamster content, and they're not engaging with you, you're not bringing value to them. It's just making the number go up, which is not that meaningful. So one example of this is there's all these threads about how to just grow on Twitter for no reason, just grow for the sake of growing.

(00:58:48):
And it's a lot of generic advice of make sure that you bullet point out the 10 things. But it's always pablum of make sure that you value your relationships, and make time for yourself. And things that are not enriching people's lives they get a lot of likes that are low value likes from random people about the internet. But I don't think that they're deepening a relationship with a meaningful audience, and I don't think that they're really capturing the respect and admiration of their peers. So I think it's just important to consider what trade-offs people make in their efforts to grow.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:35):
Ready.

Lenny (00:59:35):
First question. Great. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (00:59:41):
I recommend Gates of Fire, it comes off the Marine Commandants Reading List, it's on there perennially. It is about the Battle of Thermopylae, it's the 300 Spartans, but it's the whole backstory. And if you get into it's about leadership, it's about courage, it's about creativity, and it's really well-written, so that's one that I recommend a lot.

Lenny (01:00:00):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:03):
I've been watching The Last Of Us, like everybody on Earth. I've been watching it both for entertainment and for work, because it's really interesting to see how the show drives sales of the video games, and how you can use that to make the whole of the sales greater than the sum of its parts. So I'm watching that really carefully.

Lenny (01:00:24):
Interesting. We have a drinking game now. Every time someone says Last of us that's a new thing because it's starting to come up a lot, so everyone enjoy your drink. Favorite interview question you like to ask?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:36):
I like to ask people what they've been reading too. It's a good way to get good book recommendations. It's also a good way to see where their head's at when they're not working.

Lenny (01:00:45):
Favorite SaaS products that you use day-to-day and bonus points for something that is new or interesting that you've recently discovered?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:00:52):
I don't know that this is new or novel because I use Notion for almost everything, and I really like the new AI that they've built into it. I also have been using Lex, which is Nathan Baschez startup, where it's like the AI writing editor that you've probably seen. I'm trying to think if there's anything that I use that other people don't. I don't think I'm terribly original in that sense. I use a lot of Microsoft Excel, which I think is controversial.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is, wow, that's cool, but I get it. That's when you know you're doing serious work, you got to accelerate.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:27):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Final question, best tip for someone trying to get attention for their product, take away tip, best takeaway tip.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:01:37):
Give it away for free to the right people. If you can choose the people who are going to love it, look at the Venn diagram of people who are going to be obsessed with this product. And people who have a large following among the other people that you want to get to, whoever falls into that sliver of the Venn diagram shower them with free product.

Lenny (01:01:58):
Amazing. Lulu, I think this conversation is going to lead to a lot more people going direct, taking risks and ideas spreading. Thank you for being here. Two final questions where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:13):
People can find me at getflack.com, that's where I write down my ideas, hopefully more frequently in the future than in the past. But that's where they can find some of this stuff if they're interested. How can listeners be helpful to me is to give me feedback. I'm learning on the job. I don't think that there's anyone alive who's an expert in communicating in this crazy environment that we have now. I think we're all crossing the river by feeling the stones, and so your listeners have gone through this in many different ways. And I hope that if they have new ideas of feedback or objections, that they'll email me through that website or on Twitter and let me know what they think.

Lenny (01:02:54):
Amazing and its get flack.com.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Yes.

Lenny (01:02:55):
We'll link to it in the show notes.

Lulu Cheng Meservey (01:02:55):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:02:57):

# Mastering product strategy and growing as a PM | Maggie Crowley (Toast, Drift, TripAdvisor)

## Transcript

Maggie Crowley (00:00:00):
If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Today my guest is Maggie Crowley. Maggie is currently vice president of Product at Toast.

She's also got an MBA from Harvard Business School. She was also an Olympic speed skater, which is insane and incredibly cool. And in our conversation we discuss the three most common threads across the best product managers that she's worked with, hired and managed how to very tactically write out a product strategy to share with your team and manager why being data-driven is a red flag for product thinking. Why product content you find online can be dangerous. Her best advice for how to break into product management. Also, the impact writing online has had on her career and so much more. Maggie is amazing.

(00:04:06):
Maggie, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Maggie Crowley (00:04:10):
Thanks for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny (00:04:12):
You put out so much content across podcasts, blogs, tweets, I'm sure there's other things I haven't even seen. And so what I've done is I've scoured all of your content as much as I could to find topics that we could dig into in our conversation today. And I thought it'd be fun to start with how to become a successful product manager and what it takes to be a successful product manager, especially long-term in your career. You've worked with a bunch of PMs, you've hired a lot of PMs, you've managed a lot of PMs, and so I guess the question is just what are some common threads you've seen across the best product managers?

Maggie Crowley (00:04:50):
Yeah, it's an interesting question mostly because I've worked in startups, zero to one, scaling stage startups, enterprise, all that kind of stuff. And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.

(00:05:31):
First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it.

Lenny (00:06:15):
I think that's a really interesting point, because it sounds simple. Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making.

Maggie Crowley (00:06:33):
Prioritization is a tough word because there's so much wrapped up in that and what it means to prioritize. And I've worked for people who wanted to understand the formula for prioritization and why this thing and how can you prove that this is the right thing to work on and not that thing. And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.

(00:07:13):
Because I think a lot of when we talk about product, it's like, oh, what should you build? What should you ship? But then you actually have to ship that and that can take a week, a month, three months, six months, a year. And so as a PM, your job is to stay on that and be the person who's beating that drum over and over again, and the best PMs are the ones who can do that and have the resilience and the energy to stay with it.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Energy. That's a really important part of that. I'm going to ask you how you suggest people get better at these things. So, either we can go into how you found you get better at simplifying or we go through all three and then we can come back, however you prefer.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:51):
Let's just do all three really quick and then we can dig in.

Lenny (00:07:54):
Sounds great.

Maggie Crowley (00:07:55):
So, yeah, first one, simplifying. I think the second one has to do with this point about sticking with something and it's following up on results. So many people in the spec or the one pager or something will say, okay, here's the metric that I care about. Here's what I want to move. Awesome. Maybe they'll even write a SQL query, get a dashboard going, figure out what the number is today, that gets you some extra points, but the really, really good PMs remember to follow up. Because especially when you're in management, couple layers up in management, I'm not going to remember to follow up on that feature, but if a PM comes back to me and says, "Hey, remember we did that thing, here's what happened." I can't tell you how rare that is and how many times as a leader you might have to ask for that and for the people you don't have to ask that of is one of the best things when I'm looking at PMs and it's easy.

(00:08:43):
It's not hard to do that, especially if you've set up metric tracking or you know how to pull that information or you have somebody who can help you get that. It's pretty easy to do and it's really high value activity. And then the third thing, and I think maybe we'll talk about this later too, is that a phrase actually we were talking about David Cancel before we started carrying the water, and this was a big theme when I joined Drift, and this is about how you can't be a good PM if you're not willing to do the hard boring unglamorous work of customer support, sales, marketing, writing, copy, project management, you have to do that stuff. It's your job. No one else is going to do it, because at the end of the day, you're responsible for outcomes and results. So, you're the person that has to do that, and if you're willing to do that work, that's what's going to make your product successful, which is what makes you successful.

Lenny (00:09:33):
It's such an interesting list because when you ask most people what you need to get better at to become a great product manager, it's always communication skills, collaboration skills, vision, strategy, and it feels like these are input metrics to what it's normally what people think about.

Maggie Crowley (00:09:50):
Those things to me, communication, super important, analytical ability, really, really important. The ability to look at a, especially if you're doing something that has a user experience component, the ability to look at that and understand if it's going to work and build up intuition around that, also really important. Those are things that I would see as sort of basics of the role. These are the things that make you great at the role and strategy to me, and hopefully we'll talk about strategy in a bit. It's one tiny slice. You do a strategy, but it's 5% of the work that you do. Yes, it's important because you want to get your strategy and you need to pick the right products, but at the end of the day, the person who has a good strategy will not be as successful as the PM who ships more stuff, gets more reps and has the ability to actually create impact. So, to me, you could be great at strategy, but if you're not good at this stuff and your stuff isn't getting out the door, you're never going to be that great at the job.

Lenny (00:10:48):
And impact is the other one. Everyone's always like, what makes a great PM? Oh, drive a lot of impact. And again-

Maggie Crowley (00:10:52):
But they never say how.

Lenny (00:10:54):
Right, exactly.

Maggie Crowley (00:10:54):
It's like, cool, let's do a strategy, let's have impact. Then when I was starting off as a PM, I was hearing this advice and reading about it and I was sitting there saying, awesome, I want to create impact. And I'm looking at my job thinking, now what? Yeah, impact. Let's do it. Where is it? How do I find it? Someone help me.

Lenny (00:11:14):
I love it. Okay, so let's go back to these three and I'm curious just what you found helps you become better at these things and also just an example if you can share. So, say what's simplifying? How does one build that muscle?

Maggie Crowley (00:11:27):
This is a tough one because some people, a broad generalization that I think comes up in things like when you're interviewing PMs for a job and you say things like are they a simplifier or are they complexifier? Do they make things complicated? And so some of it's a little bit of just who you are and how you think. But having said that, there's one tool that I use that I actually learned from my dad when I was in grade school, which is when you write something, for example, and a lot of what we do as PMs is written, when you write something, read it out loud, literally just read the thing you wrote out loud and half the time you'll realize it's way too complicated, it doesn't make sense. Or what happens is when someone comes to me and they say, okay, I'm working on this thing, check it out, can you read it?

(00:12:10):
I read it and then I put it down and I say, "What are you trying to say?" And 99% of the time they say, "Oh, users are really struggling with this problem. We found this in research and we think that the way to solve it's to do X", but that's not what the document says. And so my reaction is always, and if anyone who I've worked with is listening to this, they're going to laugh is always, "Just say that. Just say that thing. The thing that you said to me in conversation is the thing you should write." There's no reason why your pros in a document has to be a certain way. We're not in school. Our goal is to get things done. So, those are just some simple tricks that I've used to help simplify what I've already been working on.

(00:12:54):
And as for how to boil things down and really find the most important thing to do, which is another part of simplification, I think the best thing you can do is just get as many reps in as you can, have people review your work and listen to them. There's a thing that happens I think with PMs where you join a company and then all of a sudden it's like my boss doesn't know what they're doing and the highest paid person's opinion and the founder wants to swoop in and mess everything up, but those people had an insight on the market that you're in that made the company worth founding and they probably know more than you and so you might want to listen to them. And so find people who can review your work, listen to them and ask them to help you simplify.

Lenny (00:13:39):
I'll share a couple other things that came to mind as you were talking, because this is a very hard thing to teach and you kind of have to do it again and again and honestly, I have this one manager who taught me to simplify in my writing and strategy docs one-pagers and things like that, and I think that actually had a big impact on my newsletter success is learning just to strip down as much as you can and anything that isn't necessary. So, there's a couple things that I'll share real quick. One is there's this book I read called On Writing Well, that is one of the most impactful books for writing for me, and the whole book is like, I don't know, 20 chapters and every chapter is more things you should cut from your writing and they show all these examples of like, here's a before and here's an after.

(00:14:18):
And all these words were cut and nothing changed. They're completely necessary. So, I think that book can help and partly it's just like what is not necessary? You think all these adjectives are important. Another thing I found really helpful is the rule of thirds, I guess the rule of three, of just always having three. Try not to go beyond three when you're giving strategy bets or priorities or things like that. Just try to keep things under three.

Maggie Crowley (00:14:44):
Yeah, it's a very sort of business school ex-consultant point of view that I do agree with and share, which is there's always three things or fewer, never more than three things. You have to have a nice round couple and if you have a fourth, you've got to figure out how to squish it in there because it just doesn't look right if there's four.

Lenny (00:15:02):
Agree. Yeah, even though I've been guilty of more than three, try hard to avoid it.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:07):
Yeah, you're using notion and you have your three bullets expanding and there's sub bullets, but at least you have that top line.

Lenny (00:15:13):
That's right. The other thing is I think that there's just a focus you need to get good at just like, people often want to lump together a bunch of ideas and then every time you do that it just dilutes everything. So, I think there's just a lot of power and pick the thing, pick the thing that's going to have the most impact and cut other stuff that may have some impact but is much less important.

Maggie Crowley (00:15:31):
I think again, simplification is something and prioritization, which is sort of the same thing, gets tossed around a lot as a thing you have to get good at, but it's really challenging. Getting to the one thing you should do is extremely difficult and being able and having the gumption to say no to all those other things is really hard, because there's probably at any given time, 10 things you should do, but you can't do 10 things, you'll never be successful if you do that in a number of things. And so you have to pick one.

(00:15:59):
And so it's both figuring out how to get confident in your decision and then B, having the willingness, and maybe I should have added this to my what makes great PMs list, the willingness to make the bet and be responsible for it. And that's what I think separates the PM role from a lot of other roles and why it's such a challenging job when done right is because you have to be willing to take responsibility and it's your job to pick the thing and it's your job to be accountable to your team for picking the thing so you better get it right.

Lenny (00:16:32):
Ownership such an important part of just being a PM. Again, coming back to this interview I just did with an ex Amazon guy, that's one of their principles at Amazon is just leaders, basically ownership, feeling like you have ownership of what you're working on.

Maggie Crowley (00:16:46):
I agree, but to me at least the word ownership doesn't have the same oh shit feeling as you're making a bet. You make a bet, that means you know that there's a chance that the thing you're working on is not going to work out and you still have to be the one to do the thing, jump off the ledge, drop in on the ski run. So, ownership to me never signaled that risk that I think comes with being a PM.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Good point. On the simplify concept, it reminds me at Airbnb, one of the core values at Airbnb for time was simplify. Is this idea that we should always try to be simplifying, and then it turned out the founders realized we're not actually great at this and it's unfair for us to say this is a value for not doing it. So, they actually cut it as a core value because their feeling was we shouldn't have aspirational values, we should reflect who we actually are, and they actually cut two different values to be more clear, even though they still want to simplify, they're just like, we're not actually good at this, so why are we pretending like we are.

Maggie Crowley (00:17:45):
I think maybe I'm good at it on paper, but there's been many times where I've been in situations where things are not simple and you just have to keep fighting for it.

Lenny (00:17:54):
Someone's trying to think about, okay, I want to become better as a PM and I'm going to try to start simplifying. What are examples of simplifying? Is it reduce your email length? Is it one pager focus? What are these buckets of things? And then also if there's an example of something you've simplified that comes to mind

Maggie Crowley (00:18:12):
On what to simplify and more specifics, I would say anything can be simplified and shortened. Maybe another way to say shorten it. Definitely emails. I read them sometimes don't love them. Make them short. The Minto principle is something that I would recommend everyone do, which is put the headline, the full conclusion first and then you're supporting argument second.

Lenny (00:18:36):
I have a newsletter post about that exact concept that people that I will link in the show notes that gives you-

Maggie Crowley (00:18:41):
Fantastic.

Lenny (00:18:42):
The Minto Pyramid principle.

Maggie Crowley (00:18:42):
Yes, everyone should do that. A lot of new PMs fall into the trap of thinking that they should have some sort of buildup. Don't do that. Just tell me whatever the thing is, everyone will thank you. Doing things like that, things like you said, limiting your strategy docs, your conclusions, your next steps to three things maximum. I would generally say a rule of thumb would be pretty much every doc you write, you can delete the first two paragraphs that you've written. You don't need them. My dad, again, to go back to my dad when I would write, and this sounds cruel, but I promise it wasn't. When I would write a paper for school, he would just, and this is we didn't really have computers, whatever, he would just take away the first page and he'd be like, just start here. He would go, "Everything on the first page is crapola, don't use it."

(00:19:30):
And he wouldn't even read it, which would drive me crazy. He would just like, "Oh, it's crap. I don't care about that." So, I would do that and then just get other people, there's probably somebody around you that's good and find people to edit your work and to look at it. I have a little Slack workspace that has three people in it, me and two other women who are product leaders, and we oftentimes send each other our work still and we say, "Hey, I'm struggling with this. Can you read it? Help me make it simpler. Can you help me fix this up?" And we do that for each other. So, find a peer maybe who's in a non-competitive space who can do that for you. I mean I still use those people to help me.

Lenny (00:20:10):
That is extremely cool. Can you talk more about this group that you have?

Maggie Crowley (00:20:15):
Yeah, I don't know if it's a group. It's like three friends. Shout out Alexa and Daphne. Yeah, I mean the three of us all worked together when we were at Drift. We've stayed in touch and I've just found that in order to be good at your job continuously, you need people who can help give you feedback, and the more senior you get, the harder that is. And so having people who can give you another point of view who maybe you can vent to if it's not appropriate as a leader who can give you other experiences that they're going through has been incredibly valuable. And so we just have a little group chat that is focused on product.

Lenny (00:20:49):
That is so cool. Is there a tip you could share for someone that wants to create something like this? Is it important for you to have worked with them before? Is Slack a good way to communicate? Anything there that's just like, oh yeah, here's a cool tip.

Maggie Crowley (00:21:00):
Slack just worked for us where we are during the day, and I think having easy access to it was important. You could probably use WhatsApp or a literal group text. There are small community, there's one, I worked in healthcare for a year and a bit, and there's a Slack community that somebody organized for heads of products and healthcare startups that is similar to those really, really powerful and a really great space to be in. And so you just have to kind of suss out where these things are. You work with amazing people and there's people around you who are going to become your friends, and so keep an eye out for them and keep in touch with them when you leave a job because you never know when they might become your little Slack workspace.

Lenny (00:21:39):
Oh, I love it. Okay, I'm glad we talked on that. Okay, back on track. The second bucket you described as following up on results, is it just do that. Is there anything more you can add there?

Maggie Crowley (00:21:49):
I put reminders in my calendar. I mean, yeah, it's just do that. But if you're launching a product, usually you release something and you have that initial push of a couple of weeks where you're finding bugs and you're maybe you're pulling metrics and everyone remembers it, then I would remember two weeks after that, a month after that, six months after that, put a reminder in your calendar to check your dashboard or check the metrics or check whatever it is that you were doing, and you won't forget and then share them with whoever might care about it. And it's as simple as that.

Lenny (00:22:20):
And is the reason this is one of the three things you think are most consistent across great PMs, that it helps your manager see you like, wow, Maggie's so on top of everything, or is it more that you learn from that experience and drive more impact or is it both?

Maggie Crowley (00:22:36):
It's definitely both. I'm not going to pretend like if you're just great at your job quietly that you're going to get what you want. Just if you're toiling in the background, doing a great job getting results. If you have a great manager, maybe you'll be successful. Great managers are few and far between, and I am of the opinion that I never wanted to rely on someone else to get what I wanted. And so I would always make sure to share that, always make sure to share my progress because I didn't want to leave it up to chance that someone would notice. So, I would suggest doing it for both reasons. And that's one of those things that people want to pretend that everything's perfect and we're all great and we're always going to get what we want and always going to get that promotion, but you have to work for it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
I love that point. It reminds me what I find one of the most important traits of a great product manager is they create this aura that they've got this, they put something on their plate and they're not going to drop it, that the threads are not going to be forgotten. And this connects to me there. They feel like Maggie's going to tell me what happened with this experiment. I don't have to think about it as a manager.

Maggie Crowley (00:23:45):
Yeah, that's a really good point. And then you mentioned this a little bit ago, the side benefit is that you learn more. You will go back and learn why something happened or why it didn't happen, and the more that you follow up on what you've been doing and the more you learn, the better you get every time you ship something. To me, the other answer of what makes a great PM is family shipped a lot of stuff. The more you ship, the more you learn. And that's why it can take years to build up expertise because you just have to ship a lot of stuff.

Lenny (00:24:19):
There's a lot of people that are always frustrated. They're not getting promoted quickly enough as a PM. They're not moving off the ladder like, oh my god, I've been a PM for two years. I'm not a senior PM yet. Can you speak more to just that thought and just how long it takes to get actually good? I guess I'll share briefly in my experience, it took me four years to actually know what the hell I was doing as a PM and then things started to really take off. What's your experience?

Maggie Crowley (00:24:40):
I would say similarly, it took a lot of years to feel confident that I knew what I was doing. My first PM job was a product management rotation job at TripAdvisor. I had no PM background. It was after business school and I left those two years thinking, yeah, I've worked on four different teams over the two years. I've shipped all this stuff, I'm good. Went to a startup, there was another product person there, they left and I was the only product person at the startup. And I realized really quickly, I had no idea what I was doing. I had no one to learn from. I had only had two years of experience and I was not ready for that job. I didn't feel confident in the decisions I was making. That's why I joined Drift is because that team had all these really incredible product thinkers on it and they were shipping all sorts of stuff. They had all this momentum and I thought, okay, that's where I'm going to go to learn.

(00:25:29):
And so then two more years. So, that's five years until I really felt like I knew what I was doing. And that's because it takes a long time to ship stuff. And so to people who want to progress, you can progress by job hopping, you can progress by going in and out of startups. But to me staying at that, when I was at Drip, I was there for almost four years. I got to see two or three cycles of the same product and I learned more from that than I did out of the year or so I spent doing other things each at a time because you got to see the consequences of your decisions and that's rare. And people, myself included, of course you want to get promoted, of course you want to move up. I'm ambitious. Lots of people are ambitious, but for better or for worse, spending the time is really helpful and I think allowed me to move faster later because I had just spent the time grinding it out for a while in order to be better later.

Lenny (00:26:31):
So, is that advice you often give of go deep into a company or a product versus just bounce and track a bunch of different companies or depends?

Maggie Crowley (00:26:39):
It depends. There are lots of really good reasons to bounce. I've done it, many people have done it, but I was surprised at how much I value that experience of having stuck around for a while and how much I learned from it was something I hadn't expected going into it, especially because you don't hear that point of view as much or as I wasn't hearing that point of view as much when I was thinking about the sort of arc of my career, but I'm glad that I did it. And then of course people always want to get promoted, always ask that question and my answer is always create impact and that can take time.

Lenny (00:27:16):
At my first job, I was there for nine years and then I started a company for a year and a half and then we sold to Airbnb, and then I was at Airbnb for seven years. So, I'm very much on that train of just, not that I intended for that to happen, but I definitely went deep and I think there's pros and cons, but there's so many pros to that, so many reasons. Okay. Let's talk about the last part, which is the third point you made, which is carrying the water, I think is how you described it.

Maggie Crowley (00:27:42):
Yeah. This one, there's no tips and tricks. It's just do the work. If you ever find yourself saying something like, that's not my job, that's probably a thing you should do. And you know what? It probably isn't your job and it probably is someone else's job and you can spend your life getting frustrated at that or you can just get over and get the work done. And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster, their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion.

(00:28:17):
Because we touched on this earlier as a PM for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going. And it's hard work. It's really hard work to stay positive and to keep people amped for that thing. And part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. Let me grab that, whatever. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes.

Lenny (00:28:55):
It reminds me of one of your lessons that you shared, in one of your podcast episodes. It was one of your PM lessons of 2021, and the lesson was, when in doubt it's your job as a PM, which I think relates very much to which it just shared. Can you speak to that?

Maggie Crowley (00:29:12):
It might actually make sense to put this in the context of the other roles that are part of the team. So, as an engineer, your job is to write the code to really reduce this down and build the thing and make it work to spec. As a designer, maybe your job is to design the thing, design the solution, design the user experience. Obviously there's lots more complexity in that role. Design your amazing engineering, your amazing TLDR, caveat, whatever. But as a PM, you don't have that thing, right?

(00:29:41):
It's not like, oh, my job is just to write the one-pager. That's not true. Your job isn't just to pick the problem. Your job is to deliver a business result. And so you're uniquely positioned to have to fill in all the gaps because no one else is incentivized to do that. As an engineer, you can finish your work and hand it off and say, I did it, and the good ones care, but you don't have to care. As a PM, you're not going to do your job unless that problem gets solved for the customer or the user at the end of the day. And so your job is to make sure everything happens for that product.

Lenny (00:30:17):
It reminds me of another interview you did where you talked about how a lot of the PM job sucks. It's not as glamorous as people often think, and most of the job is these really boring, annoying things. I guess, is there anything you want to add there of just a lot of people want to get into PM, they're like, oh, I'm going to run the show. It's going to be so great. I'm going to be a product manager and tell people what to do. But that's not how it is.

Maggie Crowley (00:30:41):
It's just one of those things that people, and when I joined product, it was just sort of becoming a cool job. It wasn't the hot job on campus when I was in business school. That was more private equity, venture capital. And now there's a sense of cachet around it. But again, it comes back to that earlier point, which is you do get to do cool stuff. You get to decide what gets built. That's cool. You have a lot of ownership like we talked about. You could see it as you have a lot of power, but at the same time you're responsible.

(00:31:12):
And so with that comes this responsibility to get it right, to make the right bets, ship the right products, get them out the door. And so there's a lot of bullshit work you have to do. Again, project management is one everyone hates on. QA is a really good one. You should QA your products. That's great if you have a QA team, you should QA them. You should know how they work. You should implement with your customers, you should be able to sell them, you should be able to find users. All that stuff is stuff that you should be able to do, and none of it is above you.

Lenny (00:31:42):
If someone is listening and they're not a PM and they are not convinced to not get into product manager, they still want to become a PM, what is your best advice for selling that is trying to get into product management of how to actually break into product management?

Maggie Crowley (00:31:55):
I thought about this one a lot and I consulted the Slack workspace team. Because it's been a long time since I've tried to get into product. And so I didn't know what was going on these days because it's hard and I don't know if things have changed. I went to business school and that's how I got in. There was a program that took MBA students. I think there are some entry-level programs out there, big tech companies, if you can get them, I think they're really hard to get because they're very few and far between. And so the most common two paths that I've seen are people who switched laterally within a company. Again, challenging but can be done. Or people who joined startups. So, when I was at my last startup, I did hire someone who was coming out of business school who hadn't been into product into a PM role. And I can't say I wouldn't do it because it was awesome and she was amazing, but it takes a lot of work.

(00:32:49):
The reason why people don't do it is because as a manager, it takes a lot of work because there's so much that these people need to learn. And what we ended up doing is she and I spent four months working together in a WeWork in person to help her onboard really quickly into the role, which was so rewarding. And I loved every second of it, and I wish I could do that again and again and again. But to get that, she basically just hounded me. Christina, if you're listening, you emailed me a lot. We talked a lot and we waited until the time was right and then you finally convinced me to do it. So, I don't know. I don't if there's a reliable path that I can say this is what my advice would be other than try a startup network. See what you can do.

Lenny (00:33:33):
And you've made up this point elsewhere, which I think is an additional key piece is once you have a PM title on your resume, everything gets easier. As a hiring manager, I'm just like, I look at a resume like, oh, they've never been a PM. This isn't the role. It's rarely that someone wants someone that's never been a PM.

Maggie Crowley (00:33:51):
Yeah. And I tell people, I do unsurprisingly talk to lots of people who either are in product or want to be in product. And that's one of the things I always tell them because if they're deciding between roles and they have an opportunity to do something, and my advice is always, if you can get someone to stamp you with the product manager role, take it. Because to your point, it's what we screen on. It's for better or for worse, it's just like you have to get that first job. And then once you get that first job, it all gets easier. You can get in and then you can talk about your experience because then the second question I have is, what have you shipped? So, it's like, have you been at PM before? What have you shipped? And it's fascinating how quickly people can't answer that question. And the people who can are always several steps ahead of the people.

Lenny (00:34:36):
Let's shift topics and talk about product strategy. Many people are told you need to get better product strategy. You're not great at strategy. A lot of people are also just confused, what is strategy? How do I get better at strategy? How do we describe a strategy? And you have a really great explanation and overview of how to think about this stuff. So, I'd love to hear your take on just how do you actually write out and describe a strategy.

Maggie Crowley (00:35:04):
Sure, yeah. And another thing that happens, and I'll give the outline, but another thing I hear, especially as you get further in your career, and unfortunately if you're maybe an underrepresented person in tech, is that you need to be more strategic. And so that's feedback that almost always happens, especially if you're a woman in product, in tech who's knocking at the door of a leadership role. You've probably gotten that feedback. And so I made it my mission to figure out what the heck is this thing? How do I do it? How can I do it in a way that is demonstrable so that I'm never getting that feedback that's like, oh, she's not strategic. And so what I did was something that I kind of did in the background because I had an engineer who I worked with who really wanted to understand why we were doing what we were doing, and he was not satisfied with sort of a surface level answer.

(00:35:57):
And he was just pushing and pushing and pushing. And so what I did was I just wrote out a Google doc and I started with like, okay, and not fancy, these are just bullets. What is the mission? What is the point of the company? What are our goals? Maybe we have some sort of high level framing of what we're working on. And then I had this big section that was just the landscape. And in that section I put in what's going on with our business? What's happening with our products? What's our point of view on the market? Who are our competitors? A SWOT analysis, key risks that we might be facing. Just dump that all on paper. Then what are the current quarters business goals or however you do planning, what are the current things that your company's working on? Then I put in, all right, that's sort of the context that we're operating in.

(00:36:44):
Then I wanted to understand where are we. So what is an honest accounting of the current state of your product, the business overall, and then the specific area that you're working in. What works, what doesn't work? What are your customers saying? Bottoms up feedback, users, customers, teams, what are your support tickets? Get that all out on paper. And then really importantly, where are your technical hurdles? What are the big pieces of tech debt? What are your engineering and technical teams always harping on that they want to invest in? Are there some big things coming down the pipe that you need to think about? Just get everything on paper. And then usually in the process of writing all that down, you'll start to see, okay, I kind of get where we are. I kind of get what the challenge is. And then you write a section that's like, what's the opportunity?

(00:37:34):
From all of that, what's going to bubble up as the top one or two opportunities for your team? Where do you want to play? Where can you win? Where's the unique? Based on your unique competitive advantage, where do you think you all should be and why? And then based on that opportunity, what are the challenges? So, what's going to be the hardest about taking advantage of that? What has to be, another way to frame it is what has to be true about the world for that to work? That's a one that's been helpful. And then what would you do? Take a swing at writing down your solution, what you would need to build, how might it work? Anything that you have, this is where I would say three bullets, maybe what you might want to do and then a plan. If no one else had an opinion, how would you go about it?

(00:38:26):
How would you sequence it? What would you do? How might you get the team to work on it? What would your team have to look like? How much would it cost to do it? All that you can start to layer in all that kind of stuff. And then I just share the doc. Share it with everybody. There should not be any secret. And you should be able to walk all the way from your company's mission down to the individual priority on your team and see the logic chain and why you got there. And if anyone doesn't agree with it, they can call out where their disagreement lands in that landscape. But at least then you've put everything on paper, you understand how you got to where you're going, and then you can have an argument about the different pieces and points of data and feedback that you're getting, but at least people understand how you got where you got. And then it doesn't become like, I don't agree with you. It becomes, I don't agree with this point.

Lenny (00:39:18):
This is such a cool way of doing it. By the way, is there a template that we can point people to that has this sort of-

Maggie Crowley (00:39:23):
There's not, I've only ever done it in a loose Google doc and then it just grows and changes. I can maybe try to write up those bullets, but it's just like I just make headers and then I just start dumping content in it.

Lenny (00:39:36):
Yes, that's all people need. If you end up creating that before this comes out, we'll throw it in the show notes. And if not, people can just bother you on Twitter and ask Maggie, where's that template that we talked about?

Maggie Crowley (00:39:44):
Yeah, I'm happy to write it on a piece of paper and take a photo of it and send it around.

Lenny (00:39:49):
There you go. Just make it really grainy and an artifact. We found Maggie's template. This is awesome. So, I've never heard of a version of this with so much depth into the landscape, and I think that's so smart because so much of conflict and disagreement comes from you just don't have the same information or the manager, exec or whatever doesn't think you have the information. So, if you just lean into, here's everything that I know and here's what's happening, and if you disagree with this goal, tell me, and then it'll change the plan.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:17):
Right.

Lenny (00:40:18):
And yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:40:18):
Part of it's also that typically speaking, when you're doing a strategy, you're doing it at a higher level. So, I don't think every product needs a strategy. Every feature doesn't need a strategy for example, you don't need to do this if you're working on a tiny slice of a product and you have user feedback, don't overcomplicate it, just do the stuff that makes sense. But especially as I've gotten more senior in my career, the questions are bigger and the impact is broader and the timelines are longer. And honestly, it was also because I wanted to get it right. I didn't want to make a bet on something and put a bunch of resources against a problem and get it wrong. And so this was also homework that I wanted to do for myself to know that I was going to do the right thing. For some reason, I'm always paranoid that other people have more information or doing it better than I'm doing it.

(00:41:11):
So, I was like, okay, I have to write it all down and then make sure I got it right and share it with everyone and make sure that they agreed with me so that I didn't screw this thing up. And it just was such a useful exercise that I kept doing it. And of course people don't read it. People only read a tiny section. You'll run into the same problems you run in with everything else, but at least I knew that I had done the work and if people cared to engage with it was there.

Lenny (00:41:33):
So, along those lines, I was going to actually ask, how long do you find this should be depending either on the timescale, say you're doing a quarterly strategy or a year, how many pages should this doc be as any guide?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:46):
It's long. It gets real long.

Lenny (00:41:48):
What is long?

Maggie Crowley (00:41:53):
The actual content, I end up writing a summary to go back to the Minto principle. I end up doing the whole thing, then putting a summary at the top so that there's one, within the first, above the fold, if you will. You can kind of get the point and the suggestion on what I think we should do or what the strategy should be, should be customizable in that section. But it can go 20 pages just because if you really want to get deep in a competitor or there's interesting market dynamics, interesting technological changes that are happening. Sometimes I'm screenshotting other companies marketing websites and dumping that in there. And that might be some interesting comments. So, it doesn't have to just be words or it can be all kinds of different things that you might want to put in there.

Lenny (00:42:37):
And you made the point that it's not like you expect people to read this whole thing. There's the summary that gives them a conclusion and in theory if they want to really dig into it, they can. But I guess how do you find that balance of writing everything and making it so long that no one's ever going to read it to like this is actually going to be useful to someone and plus here's a summary.

Maggie Crowley (00:42:58):
It comes back to the reason why I write the document in the first place. And that's for me. So, it's my homework to do my job effectively. I just make sure to share it. And I find that my, especially my engineering and design counterparts, if you're working in a true triad, will almost always engage really deeply on the doc because they're pretty much also on the line and they want to make sure that when they sign their teams up to do whatever it is that they believe in the thing that you're working on.

(00:43:28):
And so I find that those people will engage pretty deeply. Sometimes you'll have more junior folks on the team that'll just be interested and they'll get really into it too. And then there's some people that'll skim the upfront part and either say, yeah, that looks great, or You're dumb, I hate this. And okay, sure. There's always those people. So, it never really mattered to me that people read the whole thing. It was more I knew I had to do it to be confident in my own decisions and then I could facilitate a conversation, so it didn't really matter.

Is there an example of a strategy you were thinking about recently or that you worked on in the past just to give people something concrete of like here's what Maggie thinks of as a question she's going to develop a strategy around?

Maggie Crowley (00:45:28):
Yeah, I think, obviously this is where product content gets really challenging because obviously I can't really talk about the stuff I'm currently working on.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Just tell us all of the secrets. And that [inaudible 00:45:38] know.

Maggie Crowley (00:45:38):
The toast PR department would be really unhappy with me. It's questions like, if you're a director of product somewhere, maybe you're running a section of a business and it's annual planning. We're in Q4. What are you going to do next year? How do you answer that question? How do you back up your choices for that? You use a doc like this. Maybe you are realizing that the product that you're working on doesn't really matter, it's not really making an impact. You're kind of treading water. I would use this as a tool to figure out, okay, well what else could you do? So, yeah, quarterly planning, annual planning. If you feel like your team needs to make a pivot or if you think that there's a really interesting new opportunity that your business or your team should go after, is another time I might use something like this.

Lenny (00:46:30):
Awesome. This reminds me a little bit of, I keep mentioning this chat with Bill Carr that I had who is an early Amazon exec and how the narrative approach at Amazon, one of the benefits of that and the reasons they go there is partly for you to realize this is a bad idea before anyone even needs to give you feedback. And that's why they force you to write six pages in depth about your idea and then it goes in these concentric circles through the company. And idea is like, here's okay, and this is just not a good idea. Here's all the reasons why. So, I think there's a lot of similarities there.

Maggie Crowley (00:47:00):
Yeah, there are many, many times when if you combine this artifact and process with the point about simplification where through that process you just start cutting so many things because then what happens is, let's say you've gone through this exercise and you're like, okay, I know exactly what my three things are that I want to work on. Then there's a moment where you take the strategy and then you look at your roadmap and they're never the same. And the roadmap is just bloated with all of this random stuff that like, oh, well, we have to do that because of this, or we have to do that because of that.

(00:47:37):
This thing we're still working on, this is like six months delayed, so we're still going to do the thing. And then all of a sudden you've got 90% of your resources committed to things that don't track against your strategy. And it's a really interesting moment as a leader especially to sit there and go, well, what do we do? What do you do when you have that problem? And especially if you're a PM, you probably don't have the agency to say, scrap the entire roadmap and work on my new strategy. But at least it allows you to think about critically about whether you should be doing what you're doing and allows you to evaluate whether those things are still the most important things to work on.

Lenny (00:48:09):
I'm going to summarize the template real quick, and then I'm going to have another question kind of along the lines. So, if you're trying to create your own little template, you start with the mission of the business, and then I imagine you also share the mission of your team because oftentimes it's a little more specific, if you're working on it like a product team strategy. Then there's a landscape of what's happening. So, you include competitive, SWOT analysis of competition risks, product state, business state, things like that.

(00:48:38):
And then you share the current goals of what you're trying to achieve as a team slash business. And there's an account, honest accounting of what's happening in the product and technical hurdles and things like that that'll keep you from moving, I guess, achieving some of these goals. And then you share, here's the opportunity I see, how we win and how we actually achieve this opportunity where we place bets and things like that, or we could place bets. Then challenges of doing this, what needs to be true for this to be possible? And then you finally get to, here's what I think we should do, essentially the solution, ideally three bullet points, and then the plan. And I imagine the plan is step one, get sign off from exec. Step two, resource the team. Step three, start on this design research sprint.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:26):
Pretty much.

Lenny (00:49:26):
Awesome. All right. Amazing. Somebody will create this template if you don't end up doing it.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:49:32):
There's another-

Maggie Crowley (00:49:32):
I hope somebody does.

Lenny (00:49:34):
Okay. That'd be awesome. If they do, I will tweet it and we put it in the show notes.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:34):
Great.

Lenny (00:49:39):
So many promises already from this podcast. Along the same lines, you also have a one-pager template and process that I think people find really useful. So, how about we chat about that one briefly and then I'm going to go in a whole different direction.

Maggie Crowley (00:49:52):
Okay. Yeah, I don't think I have much to say about this. That has not been said by many people many times, but whether it's a spec, a PRD, a one pager, I don't even know what else people call it. It's the document that you use to define the thing that you're doing as a product team, and that means product design, engineering, your little squad. And what I think is really useful about this process is that it's the PM's artifact. So, designers produce designs, engineers write code. What do PMs do? A lot of people might say nothing. In theory, we write at least this document and it can be a pain. I've seen lots of ways where it hasn't been done very well, but when I think it's done really well and when it's really effective is it's a tool that allows the PM to start with why. And if you structure it correctly, the most important section in my opinion in the document is the first part, which is like what is the background and context?

(00:51:00):
What is the problem, why does it matter and why does it matter now? And if you get those things right, the rest gets really easy, but it gives you a chance as a PM to center the team around the problem, why that problem exists, whether it's created by your own product or it's something the user is experiencing and why that problem is worth solving. That's a part that I think people sometimes forget to think about and why it's we're solving right now versus all the other problems you could be solving and then it can become the home base of the decisions that you make along the way. So, I think it's best when you have those sections and then also best when you write down on this day, we made this decision or we decided not to do this or we decided only to solve this part of the problem, not this part of the problem. Keeping a running list of that and a link off to all the different artifacts and research and things is helpful for a team.

Lenny (00:51:52):
So, just to summarize, what would be the headings again, just if someone's taking notes and wants to create the rule template?

Maggie Crowley (00:51:57):
I don't think these templates have to be really complicated. It's like background and context. The problem. I would literally write why this problem matters and why this problem matters now. Don't make it complicated, just answer those questions and if you can do that, and then again, it's only really helpful if then you bring that document before you go any further to your team and you use it to have a conversation and you get the smart people around you to take shots at it. I should have mentioned this earlier with the strategy. The first person I go to is typically speaking my engineering counterpart and I say, shred this, go through it, rip it apart, vomit comments on it, tear this down how it gets better. And as a PM you can't be precious about your work. You need people to poke holes in it.

Lenny (00:52:48):
The why this matters now point is so interesting. I don't often hear that and I think it's such an important part of specs and plans and strategies because there's so many things you can do and there's certain things that are perishable that you can only do now. That if you don't do now you miss up the opportunity. And so I think that's a really interesting element that most people don't include and it reminds me of, I think I've done enough podcast episodes now where I'm just connecting all these things as people are talking. [inaudible 00:53:16] the John Nash thing happening where Karri, the founder of Linear talked about this concept of side quests as a founder. Because he's so good at staying focused and I was just like, "How do you stay focused and just get stuff done when you have so many people coming out?" He's just like, "There's the main quest and then there's the side quests and side quest I don't need to do right now. There's the main quest which is build up really successful business." And I feel like this is a good example of that in action.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:39):
Yeah, I love his take on quality and taste too.

Lenny (00:53:43):
Yeah. What a gem.

Maggie Crowley (00:53:44):
Yeah, big fan of that. But yeah, I mean it's really hard to stay disciplined, it's hard to stay focused and to your point, there's a million things you could do at any given time, especially if you work at a bigger company. And so the why now is an important question to answer because if not, somebody's going to ask you. So, you may as well think about it.

Lenny (00:54:02):
Yeah, it's interesting why now comes up a lot in investing in startups but rarely in product building and it feels like it should. Although I will say in the research I've done, why now ends up not being that important for startups being successful or not. So, I think there's a two sides to that coin. Anyway, I'm going to move on to a different topic and this might become a new thing that we do and I'm going to call it contrarian corner. I asked you if you have contrarian opinions about things before we started recording this episode and you had some really good ones. So, there's a couple topics I'm going to chat about and we'll see if this becomes a recurring theme and you're laughing and nodding your head, what are you thinking as I say this?

Maggie Crowley (00:54:39):
I'm thinking about when I had a podcast, you would do a show on a topic and we would click the end recording button and then every single guest would be like, I had no idea what I was doing. I made it all up, it was waterfall. None of that matters. I didn't know what I was ... People would say the wildest stuff and I would sit there as a PM and just think what. We just talked about this framework, we just talked about this thing and that's how you're supposed to do it. And then they would get off the official part and just say, yeah, it's wild. Nothing goes the way you want it to go. We're all just kind of making it up as we go. And so I hope that you get more of those takes in this part of the show.

Lenny (00:55:18):
I'm very sensitive to that point right now because someone just tweeted about how they're just finding that many of my newsletter posts about how companies write product are the ideal version of what they do and I rarely or they rarely share, here's all the challenges we're having, which I think there's truth to that, but I also get into a lot of failures on this podcast. Actually, I think the podcast is a lot more of just here's things that go wrong versus the newsletter. So, I'm just like shit, I need to do more of that. So, I love that you mentioned that and let's see what we can get into. But I guess maybe before we get there, is there an example of something that didn't go just along the lines of some sort of failure slash mistake?

Maggie Crowley (00:55:59):
I might be foreshadowing, but a question I ask in every product interview is what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty, you just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough time. And it's not only that you've done it but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important. And I remember, it was so dumb, I'm still so mad about this, that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite, red flag number one of a existing product and engineer who I'd worked with many times. We had a really good relationship and this person was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months, no problem.

(00:56:47):
Core part of the product been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still, it's still the code written by the founders kind of thing. It didn't take six months, it took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never, it went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So, many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb, sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one-pager, we just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.

Lenny (00:57:34):
And did not work out or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?

Maggie Crowley (00:57:39):
Absolutely not. But you know what, I didn't get fired, so it's fine.

Lenny (00:57:43):
I feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later it's like another, maybe this rewrite and redesign may work because we haven't updated this thing in a long time.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:52):
Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side by side re-write, nope.

Lenny (00:57:59):
Yeah, what I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite everyone's building in that new world and then you launch an experiment's negative and then it's just like, oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to claw back. We're going to get figure out how to get back to neutral someday.

Maggie Crowley (00:57:59):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:15):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (00:58:15):
Yeah. Don't do that.

Lenny (00:58:16):
Good times. Okay, well maybe we'll start a failure corner. That could be a new segment. We may have a little sound and theme music, but this time we have contrarian corner and you have a couple contrarian opinions about a couple topics. The first is product management. What is something that you believe about product management that maybe other people are less convinced by?

Maggie Crowley (00:58:39):
The one I like to have in this area is that people who are really excited about being data-driven, to me that is oftentimes a red flag for their product thinking, especially if it's an executive who's saying things like, oh, so we make all our decisions with our dashboards. To me that says that the team is over-emphasizing quantitative data at the expense of qualitative data and they're not using good judgment. They probably don't do a lot of direct user research. They don't really understand the humans who are using the thing, what they need, what they care about, and they're managing via a dashboard. And maybe if they got really, really good at picking metrics, it would be fine. And oftentimes maybe it is fine. Maybe you have a high volume business that's really easy to run experiments on and that works for you. But most PMs, most jobs, most products, you're going to be better off talking to 10 users and you'll get more and better insights out of why things are happening than you would with any dashboard.

Lenny (00:59:51):
So, the takeaway there is just be careful when someone is saying they're super data-driven. Our team is super data-driven or company company's super data-driven.

Maggie Crowley (01:00:00):
Yeah, and maybe it's true and that's great. I am not saying that you don't need data. You absolutely do need to instrument your products and understand if it's working at scale, but you can't forget that, you need to know why. It won't tell you why anything is happening. If you don't understand why it's happening, I don't think you can come up with good insights about what you should do next. One quick story on this. I remember really early on in my career, Adam Medros, who was a VP [inaudible 01:00:24] at TripAdvisor, we were in a room, just had this meeting called product review that was amazing when I first joined and someone was justifying this project and he just, I hope he is okay with me saying this because this is my memory of this moment.

(01:00:38):
He was just like, this is an obviously better thing. Just do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop doing all the stuff that you're doing. Stop with these numbers, whatever it was that they were doing, if it's obviously better, if it's logically better, use your good judgment and do that thing and let's move on. And I've always thought about that, but you can just do the obviously better thing.

Lenny (01:00:58):
Yeah, I love that I pull that card sometimes, but I think you almost have to do it that way of just like, okay, everyone, this one's just obviously a good idea. Let's just do it. Enough research. Okay, another topic that you have some interesting opinions about his product content very close to our hearts, both my heart and your heart. Do share.

Maggie Crowley (01:01:20):
Really if you're going to make good content, you have to sanitize and frameworkize the thing that you're working on. And then slowly, I think for a lot of people who are reading it and looking at it, their thinking starts to become, well look how well I did this framework. Look how well I implemented this thing. And they lose touch with the point which is creating impact. And so all of this content makes it really noisy and then makes people think that, oh, if I just do these things that I'll get what I want. And now I'll just check off my list and then I checked it off and then I should get my promotion at the end of the day. But it's like the best PMs have built up so many different frameworks and they can apply them in different ways. And then sometimes they throw them out and they say, nothing I have in my toolkit makes sense for this moment, but I know what to do because I have intuition and I have data and I've talked to users or whatever.

(01:02:16):
And so content sometimes can get in the way of the impact because you're trying to apply it and you think that the point is the framework and the point is the one pager or whatever it is that you're doing when it's not. And then if you're a leader and maybe if you've had the good and ill fortune of having published content, someone comes to you and says, well, you said in that one podcast episode that you don't believe in roadmaps, so why are you asking me for a roadmap? And then you're the who's sitting there being like, well, it's a little more complicated than that. And that was a fun take that I had, but I actually need to understand what we're doing because planning and I need to figure out what my budget is, blah, blah, blah.

Lenny (01:02:52):
That's so funny that I didn't think about you as a leader having put stuff out that people put back at you. And I think your point about one for you, for people to consume content online about how to do product management, you have to really distill it. And to your point, it often loses the nuance. Because if you had all the ones, no one's going to even read it so complicated and long. And then the other point of there's also just it has to be interesting. So, if it's another just like, here's how a roadmap really is successfully and it's like what everyone's already done, no one's going to read it. So, you always have to have a new take. And with that comes, it's not actually always true. I just wanted people to react to this idea.

Maggie Crowley (01:03:32):
Yeah, I mean it's helpful. I think there's some people who create, I mean there's many things at my last role, we all had your newsletter and we listened to the show and then people would bring, I should have found a clip, but I can't remember, there were a couple of moments where we would listen to a piece of it or find an article and say, oh, this could help. Or what if we did it that way? I think there was a newsletter article about Figma and they had some templates. They're like product review template for FigJam. Love that one. Use that one all the time.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Amazing.

Maggie Crowley (01:04:06):
So, yeah, I mean the stuff's really useful. It's just like you have to be smart about when you apply it. And then if you're a leader and there's all this content available, you have to know why you're not following the rules.

Lenny (01:04:18):
If they're just like, hey, look at this newsletter post letting you write, we should be doing it this way. Versus I think people assume these are the one way to do it or innately will work at your company. And I really like your point, which maybe counter to what I do, but I think it's an important nuance that I feel like I should add to every newsletters. This isn't necessarily going to work at your company. Sometimes the culture is different and this won't fit or this isn't a complete version. As much as I try to give people, here's everything you need to do this thing well, there's always a little bit missing

Maggie Crowley (01:04:55):
And I think if you don't have that context, it can be a little demoralizing like, well, how am I ever going to do that thing that they get to do at this magical company? But again, if you view it as more like here all the tools that you can add to your toolkit and you pull them out when you're in a situation from which they can be useful, that's how I think about it. Versus this is the one way to do it like you said, the only way you can write a one page or the only way you can write an experiment, it's more like you can do it in many different ways.

Lenny (01:05:19):
And I find myself, I'm not actually, I rarely tell people here's the way to do it. Usually what I try to describe is here's how the best companies do it, as much as I can get into and leave it to the reader to decide is this going to be a fit for me, should I try to implement it? But still, I think there's an implication. This is the way to do research, here's the way to do roadmap, here's the way to prioritize. But I think it's interesting that you also, yourself create a lot of content and you actually found a lot of value from being, let's not call you content creator because I don't like being labeled as a creator myself.

Maggie Crowley (01:05:55):
Someone one's called me a product influencer and I'll died like a little bit.

Lenny (01:05:59):
That's how I feel. I'd love to hear just the impact you've seen from spending time creating podcasts and blog posts and tweeting about really great stuff because a lot of people are thinking about investing in this stuff.

Maggie Crowley (01:06:11):
Yeah, it's probably the best thing I've ever done for my career and I am so grateful for the people whose idea it was, who supported me and especially at Drift, when that became such a part of what we were doing at that time. And it's been helpful for a couple of reasons. One is just networking and access. I probably wouldn't be here today if I hadn't done that and if a friend of a friend had read the thing, it's like it just creates so many more connections. And so access to people and networking is one of the first benefits.

(01:06:51):
Also building a personal brand is really helpful if you want, one of the things that I always wanted to do with my career is try to make it so that I'm always employable. I just didn't want to, I'm an 08 grad not to put my age out there, and it was a hard time. And so I've always had this in the back of my mind, you want to be able to have a solid career. And so I thought that investing in my personal brand would be a way to help me get access to roles. It helps in recruiting as well when I'm trying to hire people. Because a lot of my job now is bringing people in and because I've been vocal about how I like to work and who I am, a lot of people and they will send me a note and say, I want to work with you, or I want to work on a team like that.

(01:07:35):
And that's huge because if my job is to hire people, then that's great and people can get a sense of who I am without needing to be on the phone with me. My favorite benefit outside of those things has been that it's helped me learn more from the work I've done than I otherwise would've been able to. Because in order to make content, you have to think through what you did, you have to summarize it, process it, make it interesting for people. And then especially if it's in a podcast meeting, talk to somebody about it. And the process of doing that means that you're paying attention to what you're learning along the way. And so often we don't do that because we're busy working, we have our lives, things are happening. And that to me is, I think what's made me a better product person faster is because I spent the time to think about what I was doing in a way that I wouldn't have if I didn't have to write something down.

Lenny (01:08:28):
Something that comes across in your content that you've somehow figured out is to avoided being cringy and very thirsty for followers. And I think when a lot of people here build a personal brand, it's like, I don't want to.

Maggie Crowley (01:08:44):
I know. It makes me ill even saying that, it's like too gross.

Lenny (01:08:47):
I never thought of it or wanted to think of it that way. And I'm just curious what advice you'd give to people that want to go down this route without feeling, I guess one, is just feeling like they're being cringey, and two, avoiding content people be like, oh my God, I can't believe this stuff [inaudible 01:09:02].

Maggie Crowley (01:09:02):
Yeah, the clickbait tweet thread situation. I think the step one's going to be cringe. Your first 10, 20, however many posts are going to be bad. I would imagine if you went back and listened to your first episode, you would be cringing just because you've learned so much since then. Right?

Lenny (01:09:02):
Yeah.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:22):
It's natural.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Although randomly the first episode ever is the most popular episode. So, with [inaudible 01:09:29], which I could see why it was so popular.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:30):
So, it went really hot with your first guest.

Lenny (01:09:34):
That's right. That's right.

Maggie Crowley (01:09:35):
So, yeah, first get over the fact that it's going to be cringe. It's going to be cringe. Like anything, you just have to get started and it'll fade away eventually and you don't have to think about it. Two B, this is such gross advice, but you have to be authentic. It has to be real. And I think what came through in the show that I did was those were my real questions that I was really working on.

(01:09:59):
So, we joked about how we would turn off the recording and then we would get the real story, but I would turn the recording off and I would say, okay, we talked about this thing. Here's actually happening in my job today, what would you do? And so those were real questions that I had, real processes that I was working on and real advice that I needed at that time. And I think that's why it was valuable is because I was actively a PM and the way that I'm still actively in product, that was always something that I wanted because it meant that the content had to be relevant for me and wasn't just for likes and share.

Lenny (01:10:34):
I think there's some two really important points there that stood out to me. One is your stuff's going to be terrible if you don't actually have any background or experience in the things, you're just pretending. It's like you're acting like someone that knows about this thing, but you don't actually. And so I think that's an incredibly important part of this is don't try to become an online creator person if you haven't done the thing, because people will see that you don't know what you're really talking about and you'll run out of stuff and it'll be like, okay, well I did it for two months and I have nothing more to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:11:03):
Right.

Lenny (01:11:05):
And then the other piece is there's a guest who shared this quote that has stuck with me from Einstein, which is something like, "Seek not to be successful but of value." And I find that that's a really good framing for sharing stuff is just share things that are interesting to you and useful and come at it from this is useful, not from, I'm trying to build a following. Because people can tell if that's the-

Maggie Crowley (01:11:30):
Yeah, people can absolutely tell. And the other thing is there's a little bit of too cool for school mixed in here and there are definitely people who will tell you your content is cringe or make fun of you or whatever because that's what they want to do. And I'm not even going to get into psychology of that, but people will do that. And I've always been of the mind that the really interesting people out there, people who are unashamedly interested in stuff and who are like, yeah, I'm nerding out about this and I'm sharing it because I'm interested in it. And for better for worse, I love working in product. I love the job.

(01:12:08):
Even all the gross stuff you have to do, it's super interesting. You meet really cool people, you get to ship stuff, you get to see the stuff get used by people and solve problems. It's a really cool job and I've always been interested in how to do it better and it doesn't matter to me that some people might think that's cringe because that's cool, but this is what I do all day long, so I'd like to get better at it.

Lenny (01:12:26):
I think that's such a big part of it. I didn't even mention that. Just it needs to feel really authentic and clearly for you is just like, there's just stuff I want to share because it's really interesting to me.

Maggie Crowley (01:12:37):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:37):
The way I actually started writing was exactly the two reasons you just shared. One is I wanted to learn the thing and so writing helped me figure things out. And then two is I just thought it was interesting and I found it useful and I just assumed other people might find it useful. So, I did also learn, and I wonder if you found this too, is that you think the things are not going to be that interesting or useful to people, so basic for you, but people find the most basic stuff so interesting. Because there's always more to learn about how to roadmap, how to prioritize, how to hire, how to talk, to have difficult conversations, performance review.

Maggie Crowley (01:13:15):
All of that is absolutely true. And I think one of the first pieces of content that I was really happy with was I was working with somebody and they were making a PowerPoint presenter slides or whatever, and I just wrote out in my notebook like, okay, here's how I do that. I start with an outline on paper and then I draw little boxes for the slides and I write out the headline of the slides. And then once I have a tight outline and I have the literal text that will go across the top of each of those things, then I sketch out how I want the slides to go. And then I go into Google Docs and I actually make the slide.

(01:13:51):
And it was like some silly little thing and this person sat there and said, holy, you just totally changed the way I did this and this took me 75% less time than it would've taken me otherwise. And I was like, I may do this dumb drawing. Why is this a big deal? And yeah, that's when I realized that the stuff that's easy for you might be a stuff that is most interesting because it's something that maybe you're really good at that you don't realize.

Lenny (01:14:13):
I think people need to really internalize that point. If there's something that you're doing that you consistently find useful and works often, that is going to be really useful for someone to hear. So, that could be a good place to start. Maggie, we've gone through everything that I was hoping to get through and more, which is awesome.

Maggie Crowley (01:14:32):
Great.

Lenny (01:14:32):
Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you want to share or touch on think might be useful to leave folks with?

Maggie Crowley (01:14:41):
My hope is always that people listen to stuff like this and realize that it's messier than you think you can fail a lot and still be successful and that they should have fun. I think that gets missed in a lot of the product content is like, have fun, enjoy it. People are weird, people do weird stuff and you build stuff for people, which it makes it all very entertaining. So, I've always found a lot of joy in the job.

Lenny (01:15:04):
And to your point of carrying the water as a PM where you're kind of doing all the things, it's like you can create that fun. You can make the team your own fun and change the culture, create the culture. I find that so underappreciated for PM.

Maggie Crowley (01:15:16):
Absolutely.

Lenny (01:15:17):
Okay, well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:21):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:15:22):
Maggie, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Maggie Crowley (01:15:27):
First, most common one is probably the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, the little tiny one, really great way to improve your speaking skills and your presentation skills and to get distracted executives to agree with the point you're making. So, that's one. Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke is the second one. Coming back to the point about being able to make bets, I think that one's a really interesting one. And then bonus third one, this is more like a desk reference that I now have on my desk, the Scaling People book by Claire Hughes Johnson. I really enjoyed the way that one is working and it just sits on my desk and I reference it every once in a while, especially as manager.

Lenny (01:16:11):
I have it both under my laptop right where I'm sitting and then also way behind there and it's one of the most popular episodes I've done with Claire, so if folks haven't listened to that one. Highly recommend. She's incredible. Great choice. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Maggie Crowley (01:16:27):
Okay, so my husband is in the industry, as we say here in LA, and so we watch a lot of good and bad shows in TV, but I think my favorite one that I've watched recently was Slow Horses. Gary Oldman is incredible. Highly recommend.

Lenny (01:16:43):
Wow, I haven't heard that one yet. Good tip. What is a favorite interview question you really like to ask which I think you already gave away, but let's touch on it again.

Maggie Crowley (01:16:51):
I did. Yeah, it is what is the worst product that you've ever shipped? I think the best answers are ones, and I don't even care if someone listens to this and then I do this in an interview, people immediately laugh a little bit. They remember the horrible thing they did and then they share that horrible thing with you. And it tells me you have some humor, you're humble and you can point out when you've made a mistake. You've done enough to be able to confidently say, of course I've made a mistake. Because none of us are perfect. And you know how to spot those mistakes and you can learn from them. And I've always found that those conversations are the most interesting.

Lenny (01:17:29):
What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Maggie Crowley (01:17:33):
One because I've seen you on Twitter, you're a future fit guy.

Lenny (01:17:36):
Yeah, I'm.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:37):
Is that correct?

Lenny (01:17:37):
I use it three times a week. I love it.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:39):
Yes. I was also a future fit person. I think it's great. It's a great product. I'm now on Ladder Fit.

Lenny (01:17:46):
I've heard of that.

Maggie Crowley (01:17:47):
And personally, I love not being, I don't have to talk to the coach every day. I don't need the accountability, so that's not a thing that I needed as an ex athlete. So, for me, that didn't serve me and I like the anonymity of it and it comes with a totally unhinged group chat for your whole team. It's fantastic. I'm really enjoying it.

Lenny (01:18:07):
Sweet.

Maggie Crowley (01:18:08):
So, that's one more of a funny one. And the second one, not to get real niche, but I think good products are products that are focused. They do one thing incredibly well and they're not, to your point about side quest, there's no side quests. I'm a new mom. There's this app called Pump Log. I have never seen an execute so well on one problem. There's not a single thing where I think, oh, I wish it did this. It does it. It's like I paid $14 for it. I've never paid for an app like that in my life.

Lenny (01:18:40):
Okay, I'm downloading it right after we finish. Do you have a favorite life motto that you either repeat yourself, often like to share with folks, find useful, and just kind of living life?

Maggie Crowley (01:18:51):
I'm sure there's mottos' I could say that would be aspirational mottos', but the real one is if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. And again, from being in sports to going to school to being in product, in my opinion, if you're going to do something, do it to the best of your ability because that's what you do with your day. You spend so much time working, you may as well be good at it or trying to get good at it. And that's always how I've lived my life.

Lenny (01:19:20):
I so love that message. I always think about that. Final question, you are an Olympic speed skater, which I don't think people would know necessarily. That's insane. My question is there some bad speed skating that would surprise people that would be like, what?

Maggie Crowley (01:19:38):
Ooh, that is one I've never been asked before. The whole experience, I've obviously learned a ton from it, and I think what might surprise people about being a small sport athlete is that you have to think in four or eight year chunks. And so it's one of those things where you grind for so long in a dark corner and then you get a chance to get the light to shine on you and you learn how to love the process. Especially for speed skating, I was a long track speed skater, it's a 400-meter rink.

(01:20:15):
You just are always turning left and going in a circle. There's not a lot going on. It's just you and your thoughts and you just really, really learn how to get good at perfecting something over and over again, and you learn how to grind, you learn how to focus, and I think it's also cool you get to go superfast. But yeah, I don't know if that would surprise people about speed skating, but I think just about being a small sport elite athlete, it's really about years and years and years of toiling and silence to get maybe one shot at something great.

Lenny (01:20:46):
So, much of what you just said would apply 100% to product management and I love that. Maggie, you are awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you any follow-up questions, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Maggie Crowley (01:21:00):
You can find me on Twitter for sure. By LinkedIn, but just speaking of cringe, I just can't get into LinkedIn posting.

Lenny (01:21:09):
LinkedIn's gotten better, I'd give it a shot. It's actually pretty interesting now, which sound weird to say.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:16):
Thinking about it, I better go back to work in a couple of weeks and thinking about LinkedIn. But yeah, Twitter for sure, LinkedIn for sure, and I've always tried to be helpful to other people, so I don't have an answer for how people can be helpful to me, my goal is really to share what I've been doing, the rooms that I get to be in, the access to the content and the people and the learning that I've had. So, hopefully I can find ways to keep sharing that.

Lenny (01:21:39):
Maybe check out Toast and use Toast when they're at restaurants.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:42):
Oh yes, Plug, Toast. Come work with us. We're the best. I get to work with John Cutler. It's phenomenal.

Lenny (01:21:50):
Legendary, previous guest. Are there roles you're hiring for just for folks that are listening and just like, hey, maybe I should go do that.

Maggie Crowley (01:21:56):
There are always roles that are open. I don't know what the most open roles are right now, but yeah, check it out. It's a great place.

Lenny (01:22:01):
Willing to the careers page.

Maggie Crowley (01:22:03):
Awesome.

## Transcript

Lenny (00:00:03):
Manik Gupta has led two of the most successful consumer products in history: Google Maps, where he was director of product for the Maps team, and Uber where he was Chief Product Officer. After leaving Uber, he spent most of his time working on a product to help people avoid getting COVID, called CVKey, and most recently he took on a role at Microsoft as Corporate Vice President leading many of their consumer efforts.

(00:00:25):
In our conversation, we cover what he's learned about building successful consumer products, how to structure and higher product teams, building consumer apps, a concept called the consumer stack, company market fit versus product market fit, what it's like to be CPO, what he learned working at Microsoft versus Uber versus Google, and also a ton of career advice for anyone thinking about becoming a CPO someday. I hope that you enjoy this episode with Manik Gupta.

(00:01:57):
Hey, Casey Winters. What do you love about Coda?

Casey Winters (00:02:00):
Coda is a company that's actually near and dear to my heart, because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, you know I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those Codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. They're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.

Lenny (00:02:36):
I actually use Coda myself every day. It's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement. Just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:03):
Manik, welcome to the podcast.

Manik Gupta (00:03:06):
Thank you, Lenny. It's great to be here, man.

Lenny (00:03:08):
I don't know if it's obvious, but I am quite honored to have you on this podcast. You've had such an illustrious career as a founder leading the Google Maps team, as CPO at Uber for, I believe, four years. Now you're kind of a fancy VP at Microsoft on consumer stuff. It's this incredible career and trajectory. My first question is, looking back at your career, what would you say is maybe the one or two main things that you did that helped you get to where you are today? For folks that are maybe earlier in the career, of what they should be focusing on.

Manik Gupta (00:03:39):
Yeah. Thanks, Lenny, for having me. I'm also a big fan of yours, by the way. I love your newsletter and it's been incredible to just see how you have also grown both the set of topics that you cover and this podcast. Just really a big fan, so again, thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:03:54):
Appreciate that.

Manik Gupta (00:03:55):
Let me start by telling you a little bit about my philosophy of this. I'm maybe a little bit late to the party, but I recently read this book from Morgan Hausel on Psychology of Money. And I highly recommend your listeners read it if they get a chance. There's a chapter in there, he talks about luck and risk. What he says is, when you look at individuals and you think about, or you ask them, or you think about what they have done that have made them successful, we tend to put a greater amount of emphasis on effort and a little less emphasis on luck and risk. I think I strongly subscribe to that. The important thing when you look back is how much luck played a big part, and of course the risk that somebody took played a big part.

(00:04:45):
This is something that I've been thinking a lot about myself, which is what are some of the patterns of people who have had multiple careers and have gone through a journey where they've learned a lot and they've contributed and things like that? I think there are two patterns that stand out, both when I look at myself in terms of what I've been through, and also when I talk to a lot of my friends who have also gone on and done interesting things, and I wanted to cover both of that. The first one is really about people. It's about surrounding yourself with the best people you can find.

(00:05:16):
It was so funny. I was watching the Warriors game last night, and yeah Warriors, we won the NBA championship. That's great.

Lenny (00:05:22):
Go Warriors.

Manik Gupta (00:05:24):
One of the reporters, I think she asked Steve Kerr, the coach, "What's the secret?" And he goes, "Well just hang around superstars." That's what he said and he just passed the mic over to somebody else and said, "Look, this is a team that's hanging around superstars." And that's exactly what it is. If you're create enough opportunities, especially early on in your career as you asked, around hanging around people who are doing interesting things and they're doing things which really are different, or they're doing things in a different manner and it's exciting, the right things will happen.

(00:05:55):
I was lucky in a way that I caught myself in that situation. I grew up in India and when I was 16 I got a scholarship to move to Singapore to do my high school and then my undergrad studies. It just turned out that during those days, Singapore... I mean it still is, but it was a melting pot for the best and brightest folks that you can get from all over the Asia diaspora if you will. Among my colleagues and my fellow students there were a bunch of really, really smart people, so I just learned a lot from them and that gave me a great start to just go on and do something interesting. Right out of college, I started my own company and I did that with two of my classmates. One of them happens to be one of my best friends whom I grew up with who also came on the same scholarship with me to Singapore. We were just part of that ecosystem and it gave me a lot of opportunities to try out different things in college and so on and so forth.

(00:06:44):
I think the main thing that I would say here for people who are early in career is just surround yourself with people who are really good at what they do. Learn from them. And by the way, play the long game. Once you find someone like that, stick to them. As long as they want to hang out with you, but just stick to them. Because you will go on to do multiple things over your career with the same set of people. And the shared trust and experience that you build with A plus people is just going to go a long way. Anyway, that's pattern number one. I think that has helped me a lot and I also see a lot of that in other folks whom I talk to.

(00:07:19):
Then the second pattern is... This is something I resonate a lot with personally, is I'm a strong technology optimist. There's always a lot of narrative these days around technology and maybe a little bit more pessimism, and I find that bizarre. I'm just such a strong technology advocate and optimist, because I feel technology's such a strong force for good. I grew up as an engineer myself, and I've always been attracted to projects where we can use technology to solve a real human need. I did that with my startup, I did that at Hewlett-Packard, I did that at Google and at Uber as well. The passion that you get if you're a strong advocate of technology and how it can really help, it just gets you to choose a set of things that you want to do at scale.

(00:08:06):
For instance, when I joined Google in India to work on Maps, it was all about helping millions of users, around Asia particularly, navigate their world. There wasn't a good solution like that, so how can you bring technology to really solve those problems?

(00:08:21):
I think those are the two patterns, Lenny. One is surrounding yourself with A plus people, and the second is just having very strong optimism and passion about technology. At least if I connect their dots looking backwards, those are the things that have really helped me and a bunch of other folks that I see in a similar situation. I'm hoping that folks early in their career thing through that.

Lenny (00:08:40):
I bet there's a big overlap between those two points, technology optimist and just superstars. That's interesting.

Manik Gupta (00:08:46):
Yeah, there definitely is. That's actually really good. I hadn't thought about that. You're right. I think there's definitely that overlap, because folks who are in that mode, they really get around more together. I'm also an angel investor and an investor in a bunch of companies. Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that. It's really about people who have the same kind of frequency in terms of thinking about the world outlook and they want to go on to do interesting things. I think that's really what drives the narrative forward.

Lenny (00:09:14):
Speaking of technology optimism and technology in general, of the things that you've worked on, what would you say you're most proud of project wise, product wise, feature wise?

Manik Gupta (00:09:23):
Yeah. Again, I've had just the incredible opportunity to be part of phenomenal companies that have created world changing products. I had a small, small, small part to play in that. I always emphasize that. It's not me, it was a team. And I really mean it. I'm not just saying it because I'm on your podcast, but it truly is. I'm particularly proud of the work that I did both at Google and at Uber. I'll give you a couple of examples to illustrate that point.

(00:09:47):
When I joined Google in India in 2008, I started off working on Google Maps and I remember how counterintuitive it was for anybody; my friends and family, a bunch of other folks whom I talked to. Counterintuitive in terms of why would anybody ever use maps on their mobile phone in India? The reason was because the norm was that, firstly, the country's unmappable because there's no good addressing system. So how do you even look at places? Then the second one was there were always people around that you can just roll down your car window and just ask people, "Hey, I'm going here and can you just give me guidance or directions?" That was the norm. That's how people navigated for a really long time.

(00:10:32):
When I started working on it, I think for me, my belief was, again going back to the tech optimism aspect, is why can't we in India have the same quality maps like we have in the United States? Why not? Why shouldn't we do it? Why are users here not getting the same benefit and same productivity gain, if you will, and less stress in their daily commute and things like that?

(00:10:55):
So we started building it. We started building the data. We went ahead and really mapped the country as much as we could. Both ourselves and through a lot of amazing work from our users who co-mapped the world with us. Over time, India became, I think, the second largest country for Google Maps in the world in terms of users. Of course, a lot of that happened because of Android. Android took off and Android had Google Maps on it. But it's just incredible to see how, in a short span of a few years, it just went up to becoming so useful. It's not that we were just distributing Google Maps on Android, people were using it. People were actually using it to go from point A to point B.

(00:11:35):
I feel really proud about that. I think the team did an incredible effort. It wasn't even a big team. It was a relatively small team, very passionate about going and doing this, and we made that happen.

(00:11:43):
Then at Uber, initially, before I took on the CPO role, I was leading maps and marketplace. When I was doing maps and marketplace, again, how do you get the ETA that you see on Uber when you open the Uber app and you request a car... The average ETA's went down to less than five minutes globally. Just think about that for a minute. In fact, it was 75 countries, more than 300 cities, if I remember correctly, where you could just open the Uber app and get an Uber in, average, less than five minutes. A lot of operational work need to happen for sure, but the technology, the marketplace technology especially to be able to connect the right rider to the right driver, have the mapping infrastructure underneath it to ensure that the car actually reaches you in that amount of time; I just feel very proud of all the work that happened during that time to make Uber really successful in terms of providing that kind of a service.

(00:12:37):
One fun anecdote I'll give you where my world came together and it just blows my mind even today, I remember I joined Uber in late 2015 and I made a trip to India to see my parents in sometime around 2016, 2017. I forget. It was around that time. And I was at home in Bangalore and I ordered an Uber. And the guy shows up, the driver comes in, and I sit in the back of the car. He starts the trip using the Uber app, and then he clicks Navigate and he goes to Google Maps. And I was sitting there. I was like, "Man, I built these two to a certain extent." It was just crazy to think about how two of my worlds came together at that point. I still vividly remember that moment where I felt really proud that I had a little bit of a part to play in both those products.

Lenny (00:13:26):
That is some unbelievable impact. It boggles my mind how many people have been impacted by the work that you've done on the teams that you've been on. Like a billion people in India and everyone in the world using Uber. It's unreal. I would feel very proud myself, watching that experience.

(00:13:41):
Something people may feel when they see a career like yours, they're like, "Man, Manik's just killing it. He's done everything. Everything just is clicking, always winning." I imagine there's been a few times when you've made mistakes or things have been really challenging. What would you say has been one of the more challenging projects or points in your career?

Manik Gupta (00:13:59):
Yeah. No, absolutely. This is really important to talk about as well, because we glamorize successes and we don't talk enough about challenges. I'm really happy that you're asking this. I would give you two times which... I had a lot of learning from both of them, but they were pretty tough times for me. The first time was, I had started my own company at the height of the dotcom boom. We incorporated our company in June '99, and then in March of 2000 we sold our company to another company from Norway. That was the peak of the dotcom boom. Then within a few months right after that, we had the dotcom bust and it was terrible. Terrible. I know we have a pretty bad economy right now. There's a lot of stuff going on. It was really bad, because people around me, my friends, were losing their jobs.

(00:14:52):
Luckily we had some funding. We had secured some of our funding and we had had an acquisition. The parent company was pretty strong in terms of their balance sheet, so we could continue to do it. But things didn't get better, Lenny. 2000 went by, 2001 came in. We kept waiting for things to improve, but they never improved. So we had to pivot. We had to pivot as a company. My co-founders actually left the company at that point. I still wanted to be there, because I really believed that I can keep moving this company forward. Then I was working with the founders of the parent company. We pivoted multiple times, we tried a few things. I even relocated back from Singapore back to India to set up an engineering office so that we can get into a SaaS kind of a model versus an eCommerce company that we were.

(00:15:35):
I tried many things over those two or three years. And remember, this was my first, quote unquote, "job" out of college. I was doing a lot of that and it was a very tough time. But at the same time I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself, I learned a lot about managing ambiguity and just keeping people motivated through a tough time. A lot of that also has to come from keeping yourself motivated, because people can smell fear and pessimism from far. Just like optimism is infectious, so is pessimism. If you're not feeling great as a leader, people will see it. Absolutely. People are not stupid. You have to not fake it. You have to really be motivated to stick it out, and that's what I tried to do at least, and I learned a lot in that. That was one really challenging time for me.

(00:16:21):
Then the second one was, man, during Uber. 2017, 2018 was crazy at Uber. Oh my God. There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well. It was something where you just had to keep your head down and just keep staying focused on what the core is.

(00:17:03):
I think that is where, Lenny, the optimism in me in terms of, what am I really doing? Is this a service that really benefits millions of people around the world? Are we creating true change? Those are things that I just have to dig deep into to make sure that I stay grounded on why am I here and why I remain to be here and then at the same time motivate my team. But yeah, those were the two really challenging times that I have encountered, at least in my career.

Lenny (00:17:26):
Those are awesome examples. I imagine a lot of founders are going through a lot of challenging times right now with the market, and imagine these experiences for you were really important and impacted your ability to take on bigger roles and bigger challenges in the future. Is that how you see it? These are important experiences to have over time as a product leader and just leader in general?

Manik Gupta (00:17:46):
Oh, absolutely. Because like I said, you learn a lot about yourself when you go through a situation like this. You learn both things that bother you or bring you down, and things that give you energy. It's sometimes counterintuitive to think about this. When you're going through a bad time, often then people will say, "Well, during a bad time I only learned things which are bad." But you also learn things that are good. Which is, maybe during a bad time you did something and you suddenly felt relieved or energized, and then you look at that and say, "Wait, I should do more of that even during a good time, because can you imagine the compounding power that I would get? Because stuff is good and I'm doing this and I'll feel even better."

(00:18:26):
I learned a lot in terms of my own personal energy, things that get me going, things that really stop me in my tracks. And at the same time, how do you work with a team? How do you motivate them? How do you keep your head down and focus, versus getting distracted? What are some of the decisions you make around your product roadmap?

(00:18:47):
I'll give you an example. During my startup, when we were going through that, in order to motivate the team, one of the best tricks that I came up with, and I learned this from a bunch of other people also, is you just give a team a win. Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, "Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers." We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter. The point was that you get confidence from getting things out, putting it out there, and you feel good about being a builder and being someone who is actually creating a difference. That really grounds the team and focuses the team that there is some real value here.

(00:19:45):
Some of those things I picked up. Both going through that turbulent time, I picked up. And I have used that even in good times to make sure that we keep building good products.

Lenny (00:19:56):
That's such a good tactical tip. Find a win. Keep people motivated. Speaking of wins, coming back to Google Maps and Uber, they're probably two of the most widely used, successful consumer products in the world. I don't know if I can think of other products that are used by more people for this long. Then now at Microsoft you're helping Microsoft get more into consumer on the communications side. I imagine you know a thing or two about building successful consumer apps, and so I want to ask a couple questions along those lines. What are two or three surprising or counterintuitive things that you've learned about building consumer products?

Manik Gupta (00:20:32):
The good news is that there's just... Because of Twitter and a bunch of other channels, including your newsletter by the way, I feel like people are very well informed these days. And I love that.

(00:20:43):
Let me digress for a second and then I'll come back to your question. One thing that I'm observing a lot, Lenny, which I feel very, very happy about, is the quality of learning and insights and frameworks and best practices is so universal at this point. It used to be that you had to be in the Valley or being part of a small group of folks who are doing things at the cutting edge to have those crazy insights about how do you find product market fit and do all that kind of stuff. Today I talk to people from all over the world for various reasons, and it's incredible how fast people pick up all these insights and frameworks and then they apply them to their local setting and so on. I find that to be one of the most wonderful things ever.

(00:21:32):
I think folks like you have obviously played a big part, because you have global subscribers and you share some of the best practices. But just generally, that's actually a really good thing for the world, that people have so much access to clarity of thinking. And the best people are actually putting themselves out there, which is great.

(00:21:47):
In terms of the counterintuitive stuff, I think two things. One is building consumer products is very hard. I think people think it's easy, because each of us is a consumer. We think of ourselves as a good user, we think of our friends as users, we think of our family as users. And we say, "Well, if we just build it for ourselves and for our family and friends..." By the way, a lot of great consumer products started that way, so I'm not saying don't do that. But man, it's hard. It takes a long time to get things right. Because you're essentially trying to get so many things right when you're building a successful consumer product. You have to be able to reach out to a vast, heterogeneous set of users who have different needs, who have different perspectives. The go to market is always very interesting, because you can't force people to use your product. People have to choose you, you don't choose them. That's the part where... How do you drive virality? How do you drive that real love for a consumer product? And it has to create real value.

(00:22:52):
The other thing about time is that, in order for you to find product market fit and then scale from there, you just have to try a lot of different things. There are theoretical playbooks around it, but you got to just get into it. Going back to the point I was making earlier about wins, get some wins and see the results and then iterate from there. I think it's just hard and it takes a lot longer than what people imagine consumer products do. Versus, let's say, enterprise products or products of other nature. That's one counterintuitive thing that at least I've learned.

(00:23:21):
The second one is the global patterns that you see in consumer products in terms of the user interface; the core things that people do or expect. At this point along of that is pretty universal. There's always this debate where people would say, "Well, need to have one product for the U.S., another different type of product for Asia, another different type of product for Africa. I think we are past that point. That's again another counterintuitive thing, where people spend a little too much... I've seen this in many companies. People spend too much time debating that, "Oh, the users in market X are different." Well yes, they're different, but they use the product the same way.

(00:24:02):
That's the part which I think... And I'm not making an argument against localization. Of course you need localization around language, pricing. There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.

(00:24:33):
That's the other counterintuitive thing that people should know about consumer products. Build for the world from day one. Understand that there are going to be some nuances that you'll have to solve as you drive adoption in certain markets, but don't over index on building market specific solutions, because consumers have moved on from that kind of a model. Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years.

(00:26:04):
Before this chat, we were chatting about this idea of company product fit for bigger companies. How it's an approach to building new products within big companies. Can you just talk about that idea?

Manik Gupta (00:26:17):
Yeah, absolutely. I've been noodling a lot on this, especially since I took on my role at Microsoft as well. And prior to that, even at Google, this was always an interesting discussion. Let's say you are building a new product or leading a new project, if you will, at a larger company. In fact, this also applies to medium-sized companies. I wouldn't say for startups, but medium-sized companies. Usually the narrative in the room when you're discussing this with your team and with your leadership team would be, "Okay, we got to go find product market fit." Absolutely. Yeah. We have to do a bunch of stuff, as we just talked about. Consumer products take time. All of that stuff.

(00:26:57):
But I think there's a question before that question, which is how do you find company product fit? What I define as company product fit. Which is a company essentially is a portfolio of products, and every large company, medium-sized company also has a portfolio. They'll have 10, 20, in some cases hundreds of products in the portfolio. Every company has unique strengths and weaknesses. This is pretty tried, but it's obvious. And I would encourage a lot of folks, when they start embarking on this journey where they're trying to really build out products and so on, is to ask that question. How does that product, assuming it's successful... If it is not successful, it doesn't matter anyway. But assuming it's successful, does it actually serve the right place in a company's product portfolio? Or not? And if it doesn't, don't do it. Why waste time?

(00:27:57):
Oftentimes companies will be like, "I want to do this because some other company is doing it." That is not a good reason. You should only invest in products, or projects for that matter, because you can play to your strengths and you can create some unique consumer, customer value. And by the way, you can do it better than anybody else out there. That's what I mean by company product fit. Take that first step and understand does this even resonate and is it part of the portfolio? Does it make sense?

(00:28:26):
Because if you can answer that question with enough conviction, then your road to the next step on finding product market fit becomes much easier, because you don't have distractions then. Everybody gets it. Everybody gets this is a strategic effort. You have the right sponsorship at the right levels in the company, and you're executing towards it and you're finding it out. Let's say things don't go well. That's okay. People will step in to help. A lot of that will happen, because people innately get it. That this is the right product to go after from a company product fit perspective. That's something that I've been thinking a lot about and also executing as we move forward.

Lenny (00:29:00):
Is there an example of that gone wrong that you can share? Whether it's a company you've worked at or a company you've seen do it badly.

Manik Gupta (00:29:05):
I'll have to think through specific examples, but companies do this all the time, where they do these line extensions. Where they'll say, "Well, we have a lot of traction in a particular segment. Why don't we just go to an adjacent segment? If we just add two more features, suddenly this will be appealing to an adjacent segment." A classic example would be you're doing something for, I don't know, small and medium businesses and you say, "Well, now I just have to add two more features and now I'm going to go up market and I'll get to compete in the enterprise." Or it could be the other way around too, where you have something in the enterprise business and you want to suddenly go down market to SMB.

(00:29:44):
In my view, it's hard. Because again, the capabilities that you need, the thinking that you need, is something you have to really be clear about. This is not to say that it will not fit in the company's portfolio. It's just that when you're making a choice like that, make sure you set it up well to succeed. That's the other part of the equation as well.

Lenny (00:30:02):
Speaking of setting it up to succeed, you also have this idea of a consumer stack concept that I think you've been talking about at Microsoft. Can you talk about what that's all about?

Manik Gupta (00:30:11):
Yeah, sure. One of the things that I'm doing at Microsoft right now is, while I'm working on a lot of the consumer communication products, the other thing that I'm really helping the company think about is how do we get more at scale consumer products built at Microsoft. Part of this is just distilling some of the learnings that I've had over the years. I think there are like five things that I would talk about, which I call the consumer stack, which is essentially a set of capabilities that companies need to have a good chance of success at building a consumer product. Remember, nobody can give a playbook to build a successful consumer product. That does not exist. Because as we were discussing earlier, it's so fickle and so many things have to go right for you to build a successful consumer product. But at least you have a set of capabilities, so you set yourself up the best.

(00:31:01):
The first one I would say is around design-led thinking to delight users. Going back to your days at Airbnb, Lenny, I'm sure this is something that resonates with you. Design for consumer products is such a critical part of how you build the right pull from consumers these days. Poorly designed products have no chance at this point. Your craftsmanship and the design capabilities have to be A plus. And if you don't have that, then you should really invest in that. This is not just about having the best designers. Of course you should. It's just the thinking. It's a attention to detail. It's the attention to how things are pixel to pixel, moving from one screen to another screen and so on. You really have to sweat it out and really be clear in terms of how it's adding value to a consumer. That is, I think, a core capability in these days to build a consumer product. That's number one.

(00:31:54):
Number two is strong focus and prioritization. You can apply strong focus and prioritization to anything in life, but I think it's even more important for consumer products. Because oftentimes people, when they think about solving a problem, they think about coming up with 20 features at the same time, and it's not needed. You don't need 20 features to solve a problem. You just need one or two features which work really well. This whole concept of critical user journeys. How do you make sure that, if you're solving problem X, any feature that you build in the product... Firstly your product should have very few features in the beginning. But even if it has those features, it should be well designed and it should have the focus and prioritization so that you're only getting things for the critical journey so that the user can use it and not get confused. That's the second one.

(00:32:38):
Most PMs totally understand that. That's their job description, to focus and prioritize. But I feel like a lot of times the PMs do get very confused and distracted, because the number of ideas that people have is so large that they want to just throw everything into the product, and that doesn't work. You have to keep a very high bar for focus and prioritization. That's capability number two.

(00:33:00):
Number three is having the right metrics and instrumentation. This talks to the data aspect of the culture, which is, if you don't have the metric with regards to what you're optimizing for at the initial state of the product, middle state of the product, late stage of the product, you're just not going to choose the right things. How will you measure success? How will you convince yourself, your team, and broader stakeholders that this is actually working or not working? Having the right metrics is important, but it's incredible how many times people have the metrics but they don't instrument them. They'll have all these debates, because the product is not instrumented properly. And everybody will talk about the same metric, but they'll have different nuances in terms of, "Oh, what does it really mean? What is a daily active user? Okay, daily means... Okay, I understand it's on a daily basis. What is active?" And there'll be debates about what is active. Pick a definition, instrument it, codify it. No confusion. That's number three.

(00:33:59):
Number four is more on the engineering side, which is how do you get to a very high ship velocity, and the ability to experiment and learn fast. At a broader level, especially during the initial phases, if you're not learning, you are really not doing anything well. You've got to be learning. You've got to be learning good things, bad things, doesn't matter. You've got to be learning. Having the experimentation velocity, having a building culture where engineers are able to check in code, see the results, and then quickly come into another release and stuff like that, I think that's really important for a consumer product.

(00:34:29):
Finally, underpinning all of this is just having strong talent. Assess your talent; your product talent, your design talent, your data talent, your engineering talent, your marketing talent, all these functions. You just have to have a talented pool of people who like to build stuff, and they're the people who understand and have the empathy for consumers.

(00:34:50):
To me, I think these five capabilities... And as a leader, or product leader, or an engineering leader, or anyone who's basically responsible for running products in small company, big company, medium-sized company, it doesn't matter; if you're in the consumer space, my thinking here is that if you look at these five categories and five capabilities, you should really have a report card and say, "Okay. How do I rate these?" If I were to look at my own team, what do I think about design thinking? What do I think about strong focus and prioritization? Are we doing an A job? Are we doing a B job? Are doing a C job or D job? I would argue that if you get to an A job over time, because not everybody will be at A on day one, but if you get that over time, I think you will start seeing results which are very meaningful. That's how I've been thinking about the consumer stack.

Lenny (00:35:34):
Awesome. I was going to ask how you operationalize this. It sounds like it's going to turn into Manik's consumer stack scorecard, and bigger companies can leverage this at their own company and show their manager, "Hey, we're moving really slowly. Maybe this is an area we should focus before we bet big on consumer."

Manik Gupta (00:35:50):
Yeah. I'm trying to operationalize this myself right now in my current job, and I have used some version of this. I mean, this is not something I just came up with. It's something that has been in my mind for a while. I've used it in some shape or form. But during my break, especially before I joined Microsoft, I think this came together for me as something a little bit more tangible that I can use. Then I started applying it, so I think it's been pretty interesting to see.

Lenny (00:36:15):
Awesome. I'm hoping that this proliferates through larger companies and becomes a thing that we can root back to this chat.

(00:36:23):
Shifting a little bit to the CPO role and the VP of product role that you've had at a few companies, in theory this is kind of an end state for a product leader. Every PM, if they stay down the PM career track, they'll become a CPO or VP of product or head of product somewhere. A couple of questions here. One is, do you have a sense of how many PMs actually stay on this track and end up in one of these roles, versus move on to some other role or place?

Manik Gupta (00:36:47):
Yeah. That's a great question. I would say that the percentage for CPO in particular, you having a C title and being a CPO, I think that percentage is still relatively small. This is just my sense. I haven't done the numbers to give you a more accurate picture here, but I think my sense is relatively smaller. Because I think a large part of it depends on how companies are organized. Companies can be organized functionally, companies can be organized through business units, and oftentimes these days it's a mix of both. If you look at any company, they'll have some C level functional executives, but underneath them they'll have GMs. The organization design is just such an evolving field always. And as they say, companies will go one... they'll swing the pendulum one way and they'll say, "Oh, over time it's not working," and then they'll swing the pendulum the other way and then they keep going back and forth. I think the percentage for CPO in particularly in my mind is probably not as big as what people think it is. Like I said, because of the way that companies are organized.

(00:37:50):
I think the interesting thing here is I am just seeing personally, having been a CPO myself and also talking to a lot of people in my network and just observing a bunch of different companies, I think the CPO role is evolving. Or the head of product role is also evolving. I think a lot of it is morphing more into the GM model where you're running not just product management but also perhaps PM and engineering, and design to a certain extent and data science too. You're essentially becoming the overall technical product leader at the company.

(00:38:27):
The reason why I feel that is happening is because it's all about accountability. It's about who has the single threaded leadership model where this person can make all the decisions when it comes to trade offs and running the roadmaps and all of that kind of stuff. It's not ideal, by the way, in all cases. Because what that means is, for somebody to be doing that, that person has to be really, really good at all those other functions too so that everyone who is in their organization respects that. Otherwise people feel like I'm the second class citizen in this model where this person doesn't know anything about, whatever; my function and so on. So it's harder, but I do feel that for optimization around decision making, around having a single threaded leadership and accountability, I feel like that's the direction where the product leadership role itself is going more and more. At least based on my experience.

Lenny (00:39:19):
Is your sense that maybe CPO might fade away as a title and GMs become the common path across companies?

Manik Gupta (00:39:26):
If you were to push me on this, I would say that's probably the direction we will go. I think it's interesting to also think about CTO. If you look at the CTO roles versus SVP of engineering or a VP of engineering, I think it's an interesting debate too, what's happening with CTO roles. If a company is organized purely functionally, I think that's absolutely the right call. But as companies are changing and thinking about how they drive more accountability and more business units and so on, I just feel it probably will become more GM oriented. That does not mean that the VP product is going to go away or the VP engineering is going to go away. I think those roles will still stay. But the C-level title, reporting into the CEO but you're just running that one function; if I look at over time, maybe that role is lot less prevalent than what we have right now.

Lenny (00:40:15):
Do you think that's partly because there's this weird overlap between CPO and CEO, and there's often tension of who's leading the product? Is that something you've seen?

Manik Gupta (00:40:24):
Yeah. I think that's definitely an interesting one as well. I mean, if you think about it, just based on my experience, what does the CPO really do? What is their job description? I think it's useful to think through that. Generally speaking, and again, we can always talk in generalizations because that's how you should think. And every company is unique. But generally you would say the CPO is responsible for driving the product vision for the company, and that product vision cannot be divorced from the company vision. Oftentimes this is actually what also creates conflict within the leadership team, where the product vision is... people are coming up with these grandiose plans. Like, "Oh, we'll do this, we'll do that," but then it's not really grounded in the reality of where the company is. Anyways, it's around product vision and making sure it's coherent with the company vision.

(00:41:09):
Then the second big part of a CPO job is execution of the roadmap on the priorities. People sometimes think that, hey, I get to a C-level position. I don't have to worry about execution. Absolutely not. If you're a CPO in particular, even the CTO and the head of engineering, execution matters a lot. The operational excellence. Because things are so complex. I mean, we are in a situation where a lot of people are working remotely, there are all these different tool sets, there are all these different technologies that are coming up, you have different competitors. Execution is super important. And if people don't understand that that's a big part of their job when they get to the senior level, I think they're mistaken. The execution is another one.

(00:41:50):
The third is, for a CPO, especially for a tech company, because you are really driving the product roadmap, it's a very leveraged job. Meaning you have to really work with all your other peers, whether the marketing person, or the sales person, or the business unit person and so on, and just make sure that you are really even deeply connected in terms of what is really needed, so that your product roadmap is how things are going to actually come to life. It's a very cross-functional, on steroids kind of job in that sense.

(00:42:19):
In terms of the CEO, CPO, I think the important thing again is... And this is actually advice I've given to CEOs of some companies as well, when they first start looking for a VP of product or a CPO. This is almost like a questionnaire that I give them. The first question I ask the CEO is, what do you want to do? That's the most important question. Because a lot of times the CEO has either been the technical founder, or they have been the product founder. They can be a sales founder too. All that is fine. But what do you want to spend your time on? Because if you are going to get a CPO or a VP of product and then still want to own the product roadmap and own the execution, then don't do that. Because what is that person going to do? That's the first question that I tend to clarify between a CEO who's looking for a CPO or VP of product.

(00:43:10):
Then the other thing is really about, are you trying to optimize for process? Are you optimizing for strategy? Are you optimizing for team building and attraction? I think that's a really big one. Sometimes you have to get the right level of leader to attract more talent to the team. Because people say, "Oh, this person is working there. Now I want to go work in their organization." How do you think about engineering and data science and design? How do you think about GM and operations? There are a bunch of all these things in terms of the design that you need to do before you decide whether VP of product, CPO is somebody you want to get and what kind of person you want to get.

(00:43:43):
I think that's where the intersection of the work between this... especially for a tech company, the CEO, CPO have to be... And even the CTO I would throw in the mix. That has to be very clearly articulated, otherwise it creates a lot of confusion. Those are some of the things, at least that I observe from different patterns and different companies that I've worked with and also guided and advised, those are things that always come up.

Lenny (00:44:06):
It's interesting how much similarity there is to that experience as there is to the first PM at a company. It feels like they have to have the same conversations with the founder. What do you want to work on? What am I going to take on? How do we avoid stepping on each other's toes the whole time?

Manik Gupta (00:44:21):
That's actually a... I never thought about it that way, Lenny. I think that's a really good point. You're totally right. Obviously, if you're at a bigger company, then you're looking for a VP of product. Or if you're a super big company, then you're looking for a CPO. But you're right. The first product hire that you make as a founder, you'll pretty much have the same conversations to ensure that there are clear swim lanes and accountability for that group.

Lenny (00:44:39):
Interesting. I want to make sure to ask you, as kind of a big deal leader of product at larger companies, I'm curious, what do you look for in PMs that are looking to get promoted, or just deciding somebody's ready for promotion or ready for more responsibility? What do you look for and what should people focus on if they want to come across as promotion material?

Manik Gupta (00:45:01):
I'm a big fan of looking at both the what and the how. So what did they accomplish and how did they accomplish. Because they're a package. And if you just look at one versus the other, then I think you end up making a mistake. Usually. On the what, I think the what is usually more objective. What I look for... And again, it depends on the level of the person. Don't try to calibrate someone based early in their career. You have to think through that. That they're in learning phase. If they're more senior than you have to of course calibrate them differently. But ultimately, if I were to boil it down on the what, it's really about real demonstrated impact. An ideal example is someone who had a strong product hypothesis, they rallied a bunch of people around them. They may not have come up with the hypothesis. That's fine. Somebody else could have come up with it, it doesn't matter. But they believed in it, they rallied the team behind it, they drove towards it and created impact.

(00:45:58):
The impact not necessarily always has to be positive. It could also be a lot of stuff that we learned, but we learned from it and then we moved on and we did the next rev. By the time we did the next rev, we were smarter about it. Clear demonstrated impact from an end to end product cycle to me is probably one of the better indicators of readiness for someone to take on more. And you basically want to give them more, because now they have a pattern of doing things properly. That's one.

(00:46:23):
On the how, I just love people who are able to create both energy and create clarity. Think of the flip side. PMs who don't create clarity is such a time sink and the teams struggle so much. I'm sure all of us, when we think about back in the day, maybe we were in that position at some point. But we also worked with folks who were always confused and didn't really summarize, or didn't really follow up, or didn't really create that level of clarity in terms of what we need to do and so on, and how broken that felt. People who can create the clarity and then have the energy around them to get things done, I think that's the how in my opinion. Which is really important for determining somebody's career trajectory.

(00:47:11):
Then the last thing I would say is followership. Really important for PMs. Do people want to work with them? Do people at some point, as they go up and become more senior, do people want to work for them? Ultimately people make choices. And if you have a bunch of smart people and they're making smart choices and they're choosing this person to follow or to be with and work with them and reach out to them, and you keep hearing things about, hey, so and so wants to work with this person because this person is amazing; there is a ton of value in that.

(00:47:45):
Those are the three things that, if I were to really boil it down, not looking at a certain level, I think I always look for those attributes.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Those are awesome. So simple and clear and succinct. I like the way that you framed it as followership versus leadership. There's a lot of PM attributes leadership, and there's something really nice about just a way to understand that as how many people are following you and excited to work on the things that you're trying to get them to work on. That's very cool.

(00:48:11):
Along the same lines, when you think about PMs that had an inflection point in their career, do you find that there's anything correlated with something that leads to a large inflection in the progress of someone's career where they all of a sudden started doing incredibly better?

Manik Gupta (00:48:24):
I've gone through a few inflection points myself, and almost always they've happened because something in the organization changed, so I got a shot. There's always that luck factor, going back to the first question that we discussed.

(00:48:37):
But generally speaking, I think the inflection points happen in two places. One is when someone has really successfully changed the dynamic, or the trajectory rather, of a particular product. That's a huge inflection point. That doesn't happen very often, to be fair. But when it happens, you know it. You know, as a leader, this person worked on this and they actually led this change and now we are playing a different game. We are playing a bigger game, we are playing a different game, all of that kind of stuff.

(00:49:16):
In other words, what I'm saying is the inflection point for a career is correlated strongly with the inflection point in the product. If you can connect those, the cause and effect... If there's causality and not just correlation, if there's causality in that, I think that absolutely means that you've got a winner. And you really want to bet on them and you have to give them a lot more to do, because they have the ability to do it. That's one.

(00:49:38):
The second is, oftentimes as people go up in their career, they start managing teams. They become a manager, and then you become a manager of managers, and then you become more senior. I mean, that's the organizational trajectory that happens. One inflection point that I've seen is, when you go from being a manager, a first line manager, to becoming a manager of managers, and if you're able to navigate that with very strong effectiveness, then you know. If you're their manager or if you're their leader you know this person has got their act together. Because managing ICs is so different from managing managers, because then you now need to create a structure. You need to be able to determine how much you delegate. How do you coach? How do coach your managers to do the right thing? If you see somebody making that transition effectively... And you have to give them some time, but if you see that and you know that they're actually doing it, and again, a lot of followership, a lot of other things are happening, good things are happening, then you know they're at that inflection point where they're ready to take on more.

(00:50:41):
Both product inflection in terms of real output and this management prowess inflection in terms of being able to effectively lead going from one step to another, a manager to becoming a manager of managers; I think those are the two places where I feel like, if I see somebody doing well, I know they're ready to put more onto them.

Lenny (00:51:00):
Do you find that second piece is this filter for PMs that do well in this manager manager role and go on to do better and better and then a lot just fall away because they can't handle that?

Manik Gupta (00:51:12):
Yeah, I think so. Maybe I'm a little bit more traditionist on this point. I know there are other schools of thought on this, which I respect. Which is there are a lot of times where people are like, "Well, oftentimes the best PMs are PMs who are IC PMs. They have this crazy, incredible, unbounded energy and they don't want to waste their time on management and whatnot and do that. Because a large part of a PM's job, by the way, is managing by influence. PMs typically don't have large organizations. In fact, one of the most leveraged teams in almost every company... Because you talk about PM manage ratios, PM design ratios, they're never one-ish to one, or one-ish to five, or one-ish to six. Sometimes it' going to be one-ish to 10. At Google it used to be one-ish to eight to one-ish to 10.

(00:51:52):
I personally see that transition... If somebody's making that transition successfully and they're getting good scores out of it and delivering the product and the output of the team is significant, I definitely see that as a good filter criteria for someone whom we can bet on.

Lenny (00:52:06):
Do you find there's common habits or pitfalls PMs make to shoot themselves in the foot in their career, especially early on?

Manik Gupta (00:52:14):
Oh, I see that all the time. There's a few of the things that I have picked up. And by the way, I was doing this too early on and I learned the hard way. The first one I would talk about is you are early in your career and everyone expects you to just manage things and manage the process and all of that. Make sure that trains are running on time and all of that. Which, by the way, is really important for an early in career PM to understand. That that's actually a big part of your job. Let's not over glamorize a PM. A large part of being a PM initially is just basically doing whatever the team needs you to do. But I think one of the pitfalls of that is, if you start putting process over progress, that's a problem.

(00:52:58):
What I mean by that is, you want to introduce process into almost everything that the team does and not be flexible on shipping things out there and all the things that can come in the way of progress. If process is helping progress, great. But if process is hurting progress, you should not be the person saying, "No, no, no, no. We can't do it, because I'm just so married to the process. Because as a PM, that's what I own." I mean, as a PM you don't write code typically, you don't write design specs, you write product specs. Sometimes you feel like, what is the set of attributes that I own? Especially early in career PMs. And you're like, "I own this process. I own this weekly standup meeting, or I own this sprint planning, or whatever." And then you get so married to it that you forget the fact that that's just a means to an end and the end is what you're going to be actually measured on. That's one mistake that I see people making early on.

(00:53:48):
The second one is becoming really too self-centered. It's all about me, not the team. I'm the PM. There's this myth that keeps going around. The PM is the CEO of the product. That's one of the most incorrect things in the world. The PM is an enabler. I said earlier, it's a leverage job. Your job is to really make the team successful. Of course you have to have the product thinking and the roadmap and all of that, but sometimes this can go to their head. Then people become too self-centered and that's a red flag.

(00:54:21):
Then the third one would be just not admitting your mistakes or learning from them. Early in career, the only thing you should optimize for is learning. Sure, you'll make a lot of mistakes. You don't know much yet. You're just coming into this journey and you should be humble and you should be learning and you should be saying, "Oops, I screwed up over here." And that's okay. That's fine. And by the way, if you work in a company where that is not accepted, you should not work in that company. What's the point? You should really be optimizing for learning and learning from other people. And people should be saying, "Yeah, don't worry. It's okay. You made the mistake. Learn from it. Don't make the mistake again. That's fine." But that's the kind of culture you want to choose for yourself.

(00:55:01):
Those are the three pitfalls that I see people get into, especially early on in their career.

Lenny (00:55:05):
You touched on how different companies work in different ways and look for different things in different PMs. And something I wanted to ask you is just to chat a bit about the difference between working at Google versus Uber versus Microsoft as a PM, and also just generally how product is built differently at these companies. It's something I'm trying to do with this podcast as much as possible. Just give an overview of what product is like at different companies. You've worked at three of the biggest, and so I'm curious to hear what you can share around that.

Manik Gupta (00:55:32):
Yeah. It's actually really interesting. I mean, all the three companies are so different. Google, the core DNA of the company was very much engineering. In fact, there used to be a framework which was around technology insights drive innovation. It was always about what is the best tech we can come up with, which is going to indeed drive innovation, and have a longish view so that the market will get there. That was the Google philosophy always. As a PM, your job at Google... It might have changed in the last six, seven years that I've not been there, but at least when I was there from 2008 to 2015, especially working on Google Maps, it was all about how do you take good long-term bets grounded in strong technical insights, and then use the power of Google Search distribution to really get your product out there. That was it.

(00:56:33):
On the Maps team, our innovation was pretty much around crowdsourcing everyone's location signals for traffic. Huge, huge accomplishment. We had the best traffic models in the world. And then being able to do this crazy route optimization for driving directions. Then on top of that, we had the search stack, which came from Google Search anyway. So that you can search for any address, any business and so on.

(00:56:55):
Anyway, as a PM it was partnering very closely with engineers and really amplifying the engineer's ideas and so on. I think at that point also a lot of Google PMs were very technical. Very, very technical. Because that was just part for the course. It was expected that you will be able to at least have engineering discussions. A large part of what I did as a PM at Google, especially initially, was getting into the technical details with my engineers and really geeking out on what we can do. That was the Google model.

(00:57:25):
By the way, one thing I should say about Google before I go to... At Google as a PM, at least all the way up to the time even when I became a director, I never had to think about business models, man. Never. It was fascinating. You were in this weird state where you could just build and have the consumer traction and all of that, but you never thought about P&L, never thought about revenue and so on.

(00:57:48):
Then I landed at Uber, which was very different. Uber was very operations, very business driven, very P&L. In fact, one of the most incredible things that Uber did was they had a dashboard which every employee in the company could look at, and it had last week's revenue, last week's number of trips that we did, and you could slice and dice it and all of that. I think that changed over time as we became a public company and so on. But the point was that it was really in your face all the time. When there were weekly newsletters sent out, it was all about growth, it was all about business, all of that kind of stuff. It was very operational and business, so as a PM over there it was a lot about managing a bunch more stakeholders. The operations teams, the marketing teams, the policy teams and so on. And how do you work with them to deploy your product into each of these markets. Of course then a large chunk of your work was still working with the engineering team. It was different in that sense.

(00:58:47):
I think at Uber the other thing was it was also much more of a real time business. I mean, Google was also real time. Google Maps was real time. Billions of users were using it. But Uber was... every day there was something going on in the market and you had to keep on that hustle in terms of how do you make sure that your staying competitive, your product is working well, there are no outages. All of that kind of stuff was really important.

(00:59:09):
Then finally, on Microsoft... I mean, Microsoft has been around for quite a while. The company went through so many different things and then over the last several years, especially under Satya's leadership, it has done so well. Incredibly well in terms of how the company has changed the culture, the kind of products that they have in the market, the traction they have in the market.

(00:59:29):
I think I would describe Microsoft as both... first and foremost, it's a very strong tech company. The engineers here are incredible. Oh my God. I am so privileged to work with some of the best engineers that I've worked with in my career. At the same time there's a lot of legacy. There are a lot of products that have been around for a really long time, which is good and bad. The good part is that they have seen pretty much every pattern there is to see. In fact, they came up with a lot of those patterns themselves. The bad part sometimes can be that change is hard. How do you convince people that we're going to go down a different path? As a PM, a lot of it is around bringing outside in perspective, bringing clarity of like, "Hey, this is how it has actually worked somewhere else." Bring a specific example. Let's try it out and see how that works.

(01:00:13):
The final thing I would say about it is the company is so grounded in trust. If there's one word that I would say about Microsoft is trust. They really care a lot about customers. Customers trust Microsoft a lot. I've been in some of the customer meetings myself and I can totally hear what customers say. It's all about trust. They expect resilience, they expect the products to work, and they expect that when they have a problem on the surface, that Microsoft will take care of it. They built that over time. A lot of that goes into your mind as a PM when you're working in that company, that a lot of the stuff that we are doing here is to really help our customers.

Lenny (01:00:48):
Going back to your point about company-product fit, these cultures and the way they work just fits perfectly with the thing they end up building. I wonder which one comes first.

Manik Gupta (01:00:57):
It's true. That's a whole nother conversation we can have at some point. I have a lot of thoughts on that. But I'll just echo what you just said, which is that's the reason why it's so important for companies, when they embark on new initiatives, to be really, really thoughtful. Is this the right area for us to get into? Or rather, what are the conditions and the reasons why we are getting into something? We have to be super clear on that. Because if the starting conditions are not right, then you will just trash the team. The team will keep working on something and people will never find the right internal fit. So that's super important.

Lenny (01:01:35):
You worked on Google Maps and Uber, which I imagine you still use often and maybe billions of people use every day. Is there a feature that you wish that you built back when you were on the team, or that you think should be killed, that annoys you about either of those products?

Manik Gupta (01:01:50):
Wow. Okay. This is a super interesting one. I don't know if that's something that I could have built at Google Maps, but one of the things that's interesting is the self-driving technology has just not gotten there fast enough. I feel like the best and brightest actually worked on it and are still working on it and it will get there. I'm a big believer. But of course the timelines have shifted for various reasons, because it is a really hard problem. It's actually really interesting to see what Cruise is doing right now in SF. They have started the pilots and so on, so I'm really happy to see some progress happening. I know Waymo's been doing a bunch of this already.

(01:02:29):
But it would've been amazing. One of the things that we used to talk about all the time at Google on Maps was how would we design a navigation product when people are in self-driving cars? We had some really interesting ideas at that point, but we never got to it. Not because we didn't prioritize it, but the technology isn't there. I still keep a close watch on that and see at what point are we going to get there. It's going to take years, but it is just such a different paradigm. It's like computers talking to computers, algorithms talking to other algorithms. Then there's a human in the mix in terms of serving the human at the end, but it's like the human is not initiating that much. It's just, stuff is happening around it.

(01:03:08):
Anyway, that's one thing that is unfinished business, if you will, in my mind. And hopefully, as the technology comes together, that will happen.

Lenny (01:03:16):
Amazing. Manik, you've been extremely generous with your time. Just two last quick questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out maybe, or learn more about what you're doing? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Manik Gupta (01:03:28):
Yeah. You can find me on Twitter, you can find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two places. I have not been very active on both those recently. I've not been active as a contributor, but I'm very active on those two platforms as a consumer. If you have any questions, if you have any thoughts, would love to hear from you, so please send me a note.

(01:03:47):
In terms of how listeners can be helpful, I just want to learn what's new and what's out there. I've had the privilege of being in these incredible companies. The reason why I'm still doing what I'm doing is because I still want to learn. If there are better patterns out there that you're seeing, particularly around how to build products, would love to know if there are other ways people think about finding product market fit. Because that's such an elusive thing that I just keep thinking a lot about. If you have some techniques, some tips, some best practices that you have learned and it has worked for you, please, please, please reach out to me. I would love to learn that, because it's so important for us to keep having that conversation.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Awesome. It's always such a pleasure chatting. I always learn a ton. And this did not disappoint, so thank you again for being here.

Manik Gupta (01:04:30):
Lenny, thank you so much for asking all these questions and giving me the opportunity to share my learnings over the years. Thank you.

Lenny (01:04:36):
Absolutely my pleasure. That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce. One of the most legendary launch events in startup history. Just looking back at that, any lessons from what you did right to get people to pay attention?

Marc Benioff (00:09):
I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17):
Your stock is at an all-time high. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow.

Marc Benioff (00:24):
I actually never look at the stock. I find the stock to be very distracting. The stock isn't the goal. That's not why we're doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30):
AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime. When was the moment for you where you started to realize this?

Marc Benioff (00:38):
I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44):
As a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (00:50):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01):
Today, my guest is Marc Benioff. He's co-founder and CEO of Salesforce, which is the second largest B2B SaaS company in the world worth around $350 billion at the time of this recording, making $35 billion a year in revenue, and 25 years later, is still growing like crazy and dominating the market. In our conversation, we talk about leadership, AI, domain names, beginner's mind, marketing, product, sales, the hardest moment in Marc's journey of building Salesforce. Also, what exactly is an agent and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Marc, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Marc Benioff (04:00):
Excited to finally get connected with you and excited to do this podcast with you too.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:04):
I'm even more excited, and I actually want to start with something that I think most people don't know about you, but to me, it's almost like a microcosm of how far ahead you look and almost how... basically, how visionary you are, and that's that you've owned a number of epic domain names. For example, bill.com, you.com-

Marc Benioff (04:26):
You.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:26):
... code.com, appstore.com. First of all, are there others I don't know about?

Marc Benioff (04:28):
There's a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Lenny Rachitsky (04:30):
Salesforce.com.

Marc Benioff (04:32):
That all came from... I'll tell you. It's a good story actually because what happened was I was working at Oracle for 10 years from 1986, and 1996 rolled around like it was a snap of the fingers. All of a sudden, I realized, "Whoa, what has just happened to the last decade?" The decade just flew by. It was crazy. It was a big moment for me in my career, and I had a... It was a huge acceleration. I went from being a kid right out of college to working for Larry Ellison. But after 10 years, I was pretty trashed, and so I said to Larry, "Hey, I need to go and take some time off."

(05:13):
So I went to Hawaii and rented a little house on the beach. I had done some angel investing, and it was a cool moment where some of my companies started to go public, including Siebel Systems and others, and Saba Software, and people I had met at Oracle like Tom Siebel and Bobby Yazdani. Then, I was just fascinated at that point with the internet. I had been working on it at Oracle for a couple years, so I started buying a bunch of domain names of companies that I thought companies. They weren't companies yet. Now, they are companies. But ideas that I thought the names would be great companies one day and reflected where I thought things were going. Yeah. It's a long time ago now. It's a really long, long time ago. I think almost 30 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:00):
So one of the domain names you owned was appstore.com, which I know you gifted to Steve Jobs, I read in your book. Is there a story there that you could share because that's an epic domain just to gift?

Marc Benioff (06:09):
It's a great story, but it's really a story about my relationship with Steve Jobs. When I was in college in 1984, I had the opportunity to be an intern at Apple. I wrote the first native assembly language on the Macintosh. It's a crazy thing to be able to say, but it's true that I was writing these example programs for this Macintosh 68000 Development System on these Apple headquarter buildings in Bandley, Bandley Road in Cupertino and started to have a relationship with Steve Jobs in that... Not that I was actually talking to him. I was like this snot-nosed 19-year-old kid, but he's running around the building. We have this refrigerator over here with all these fruit juices. There's a masseuse over here doing shots and massages. There's a motorcycle in the lobby. There's a pirate flag on the roof, and there's Steve Jobs running around, yelling at everybody, and it was freaking cool.

(07:10):
Okay. So you can just imagine like you're like, "Whoa, this is like I'm in a movie." There's a lot of other cool parts of a movie too that were going on, and it started my relationship with him, and then I actually got to know him then as I eventually got to Oracle. Then, eventually, I started Salesforce, and I had this moment at Salesforce. It was, I think, 2000, 2001. I cannot remember exactly what it was, and we were at the opening of one of his movies for Pixar, and we're having dinner. There's a lot of details around the dinner. It'll be a hugely long story if I go forever.

(07:56):
He says to me, "Well, Marc, now, listen to me. You're doing so great. You've got your company, Salesforce. If you need any help, you make sure you call me, okay?" I'm like, "Yes, sir. I will do that." He took out his... He had just introduced the iPod, and he's like, "I got a thousand songs in my pocket here. Look at this, and that, and all that." It's this cool device. I'm like, "That's such a cool screen. Steve." He goes, "Oh, thanks so much." I go, "Steve, you could do movies on there too, not just... or photos. You didn't have to do songs." "No, Marc. I will never do a device like that. Absolutely not."

(08:34):
That's a little insight into his personality that he would never ever exactly say, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to do the movie device that have the photo, the phone, the this." So, anyway. Things were moving along at Salesforce, and so I was like, "I'm stuck, and I need to get through my block, writer's block, entrepreneur's block. I'm going to reach out to him." He's like, "Come down here right away."

(09:03):
So, literally, I got in my car, brought a few of my team with me, and we go down, and he's like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're blocked. There's three things you need to do right now." I'm like, "Okay. What are they?" He go, "Your company, it better get 10 times larger than it is now in 24 months or it's over." "Oh, okay. Yes, sir. Yes, sir." "Number two, you better sign a huge customer for this Salesforce automation product like Avon. They're a great salesforce." The CEO of Avon was on his board at the time, so that was on his mind. "And one last thing I'm going to tell you you must do." I'm like, "Yes, sir. What is it?" "You better go build an application economy." "An application economy?" "Yes." "What does that mean?" "I don't know, but you're going to go figure it out."

(09:55):
It was like meeting with your guru and getting a Zencon or something where you're... Now, you have a puzzle I have to solve. I literally went away, and I had all the notes from the meeting. I went through it over and over again. Then, finally, I'm like, "I think he wants me to build an app store." At that moment, I went to the domain registry, and I bought appstore.com. Then, I started working on it at Salesforce so that we would have the ability with our platform to build apps, and then sell them, and that you could do all these things.

(10:34):
So I did all that and launched AppExchange in 2005 or 2006. We didn't call it App Store because when we tested the App Store name in focus groups, customers are like, "This is not an app store. This is an app exchange. We're all going to exchange apps and capabilities with each other." Anyway, it rolled out, iPhone rolled out, and then he basically said to me one day, "Hey, come down and see me." This is maybe a year after iPhone. I'm like, "I'll be right down."

(11:08):
I get down there, and I have some team members with me. They'd heard this story before, et cetera, and then we're sitting there like this in the Apple Auditorium. It's not like in a hotel or anything. I remember it very clearly like it was yesterday. He said, "I brought you all down here today." It's very good theatrical performance. I could never do what he does. It's incredible. He's got the thing, and then he says, "And I'm here to reveal to you the App Store." All of our people go, "Huh." They're doing break breath, and they're all like... go white because they're like, "Oh, Marc has been talking about App Store for years. How could Steve even..."

(11:51):
Then, at the end of it... It's all over. Everyone leaves the auditorium. They're all going out to play with the App Store and all these things. I walked down. He's sitting down there by himself working on something. He's in the corner of the stage. I go, "Hey, Steve. Can I talk to you for a second?" He goes, "Of course." Very generous with me. Very kind with me. I go, "Steve, I'm going to give you a gift." "Wow, but Marc, what are you are going to give me?" "Steve, I'm going to give you something you don't have, but maybe you'll need, which is the appstore.com URL, appstore.com, and the trademark for App Store because after that meeting we had six years ago, I ended up trademarking these things and buying this URL." He's like, "Oh, it's very nice, but you know this App Store thing isn't going to be very big. Whatever, but thank you very much." That was the story of App Store. It's amazing. It was a very amazing relationship that I had with him. Very grateful to have that relationship and dramatically influenced me in my career and my whole life.

Lenny Rachitsky (12:59):
There's one thread that I love about everything you shared. Here is how generosity was at the center of so much of this, him helping you, you helping him, just wanting to help each other.

Marc Benioff (13:08):
He is a very generous person, and I'll tell you that he never turned down anything that I asked him to do. I have so many stories, but one story was I was thinking about buying this house, and I wasn't sure should I buy this house, Should I not buy this house, whatever, and so he went... He said, "I'll go look at it for you." So he went, he is looking at this house, and then he calls me, and he goes, "Well, I don't know if you should do this or that, but this might be good. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is a good idea."

(13:41):
Then, I'm emailing with him after that, and he's very sick, and it's all very sad. Then, he sends me an email, and the last email he sent to me was he said... I said, "Wow. Well, this has worked out better than I thought." He goes, "Marc, everything has worked out so much better than we could have ever imagined." It was just a beautiful thought and incredibly sad all at the same moment, and that was my last correspondence with him.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:14):
I feel like we could do Steve Jobs stories all day.

Marc Benioff (14:16):
Yeah. Oh, no, I have hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:19):
Yes, you can.

Marc Benioff (14:20):
I have a lot of Steve Jobs stories, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (14:21):
Oh, man.

Marc Benioff (14:22):
Yeah. Anyway, those are a couple of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:24):
By the way, I also love that he had B2B SaaS advice here like, "You need a big customer. You need to hire ACVs, build the marketplace."

Marc Benioff (14:30):
Oh, he hated those. He hated SaaS, and he hated that I was doing enterprise software.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:31):
Yeah, he did.

Marc Benioff (14:35):
He's trying to talk me out of being an enterprise software executive. He's like, "Now, Marc, what are you going to do? You're going to go home and tell your kids that you're working on enterprise software? Who do you sell to, CIOs? Have you had met them? How can you be doing this? I can't imagine a more horrible career." I'm like, "I love it, Steve." "No, Marc, you cannot love this. This is not great." It was really a funny thing. He really disliked that, but yet, he was incredibly supportive of me. He would call me all the time. It was really amazing, actually.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:06):
Yeah. It feels like a place he was wrong in the end here, which is cool, cool to know. I want to go in a different direction.

Marc Benioff (15:12):
He was rarely wrong, by the way, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:14):
He was rarely wrong with B2B SaaS. $350 billion of value. Who would've known it existed? Speaking of that, so I want to zoom back to the beginning of Salesforce and when you launched Salesforce. It's crazy to think back to that when basically, you were trying to convince people the future of software was not desktop software, it was going to be in the cloud, it was SaaS. You had all these end of software logos. You had mascots walking around with this no software thing. You hired fake protesters at... I think it was Siebel's conference. It was very hard.

Marc Benioff (15:44):
I think you read one of my books, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:46):
I know the history of a lot of these things.

Marc Benioff (15:48):
Oh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:49):
It's one of the most legendary launch events in startup history, so I've heard of it many times at this point.

Marc Benioff (15:54):
It was a crazy moment. I mean, Siebel, who was really the enterprise software company doing CRM, was doing a user conference. I was looking for an opportunity to launch our product, so we hired a bunch of actors. They were doing this event in San Francisco, and San Francisco is very woke, so people expect a good protest. So we got some picket signs at Home Depot and made some signs that said, "The end of software is near," and all kinds of other... "No software," and all these things. We had a lot of funny things on signs. We were running a protest outside of Siebel that they were in the software business, but we were like, "Oh, no, we've got to get out of software. We've got to create the end of software." So we have picketers outside of the streets.

(16:50):
Anyway, he comes out himself out of the building and really gets super upset. Right then, we hit a button, and we have other actors in a van who come out, and they are staging themselves as news crew. So they are like KNMS, K No More Software, and we're like... They're interviewing the protesters. So now he thinks that it's a media thing. He calls the police. He got very upset. He's a great guy. By the way, I love Tom Siebel. I think he's also one of the great entrepreneurs of our generation. He's just fuming, and he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't exactly know it's us, and we're just having the best time. That night, we had our huge launch event at one of the top theaters in San Francisco. We hired a great band, and it was really... We just had so much fun. It was just a really great time. That was all happened. I remember very well. It was February 22nd of 2001 or 2000, 2000, February 22nd, 2000.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:06):
I love this. I haven't heard that interview, the reporter part of that story before.

Marc Benioff (18:10):
It was crazy.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:12):
I love it, and it sounds frivolous potentially, but I think the genius of this that I want to touch on is-

Marc Benioff (18:18):
"Frivolous" is a good word. It probably was frivolous.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:21):
So what I imagine is you're trying to get people to even know Salesforce exists, to differentiate, to get the name out, and I feel like that's something a lot of founders struggle with. They don't really know how to get their name out, how to get people to pay attention. Just looking back at that success, I guess, just any lessons from what you did right to get the word "Salesforce" out to get people to pay attention at all to what you were doing?

Marc Benioff (18:42):
Well, it's a noisy world, Lenny, and you can see that. You can get on Twitter. It's like... I mean, there's a lot of noise, and how do you break through? We have that challenge today. We're introducing a huge new product called Agentforce. I've only been working on it for a couple months now. I introduced it at our Dreamforce Conference, and that was one way to break through, which was I took our conference and said, "It's just going to be about Agentforce." I'm trying to think about, "What are all the things I need to do to get my company 100% on Agentforce, my customers, everyone?" because I know I have a window of opportunity here.

(19:25):
We're first, we're ahead. We have hundreds of customers on this now. We're on it, which is amazing. We've moved our whole help infrastructure to Agentforce. We're seeing incredible results. We've cut our human escalation from our support infrastructure down by 50%. We're resolving 83% of all of our inquiries robotically. It's incredible. So, now, how do I get that message out? How do I do it globally? How do I find my KNMS moment where I can come up with something that's viral and exciting?

(20:04):
I'm trying lots of different things. I have Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson who are two friends of mine helping me. So they said, "We'll cut ads for you." They have not been together in an ad ever, and they haven't done anything together since True Detective. They're friends of mine. Again, very generous people to agree to do this. We've shot three ads so far. I put them out on Twitter to get feedback from folks. Is this a good idea?

(20:35):
I am running this help.salesforce.com to show what we can do with it. Is that a good idea? I'm training all my salespeople in how to sell it. Is that a good idea? I'm running aggressive marketing against Microsoft because they have really a terrible product, Copilot, that I have to position against and market against. Is that a good idea? Should I be marketing and positioning against them?

(20:58):
I'm trying lots of things, and what I'm trying to do, Lenny, is what I recommend to all entrepreneurs. The message is really in the medium here, which is that I am looking to try to find the winning tactic and turn it into a winning strategy. I don't know actually which one of those things is going to be the most important thing in launching this product, so I'm trying a lot of things with that old expression. I'm throwing everything against the wall. I'm looking at what's going to stick. Then, once I find that thing, I will then grow that as my strategy, and that is what I'm trying to do.

(21:33):
I'm even expanding my distribution organization. I'm trying to hire an additional one to 2,000 account executives just to focus on Agentforce. So I'm trying to do everything I can to get that light switch to go on where I can show customers this is an incredible opportunity to lower your cost, to make things better, and to show that for the first time, we can have digital labor, that Salesforce isn't just managing your data, but we're a digital labor provider. So this is that moment.

Lenny Rachitsky (22:03):
There's so much there that I love, this idea of trying a bunch of things, looking for the tactic that becomes your strategy. It feels like also there's this focus of just go all in and focus on this one thing, and then try a bunch of different ways for this one thing that you're focused on to win. There's also an element of... I just had Seth Godin on the podcast, and one of his big lessons is be remarkable. Create something people remark about. So this celeb-oriented ad that you're working on, I think, is a really good example of that.

Marc Benioff (22:31):
Well, that is a key thought though that he's saying, which is you got to find it, but finding that is the hard part, so you got to be like... One of my friends is Chris Rock, the comedian. So what he'll do is he just doesn't go out and do a Netflix special with all of his jokes. He's out there testing his jokes in clubs and doing all kinds of crazy things. I won't go through all the crazy stuff he does to test his jokes, but by the time it gets to the big Netflix special, he knows what works and what doesn't work. So that is something that we all have to do as entrepreneurs. We need to be testing lots of things. We need a lot of experimentation, and we can't be too arrogant.

(23:15):
I think another thing that's extremely important is... I have a pretty deep meditation practice for three, four decades which is we have to be cultivating our beginner's mind. We have to use our mindfulness in a way to clear everything out and then get back to, "What is my beginner's mind?" In the beginner's mind, I have every possibility, but in the expert's mind, I have few, and in some cases, maybe none. So I've been doing this a long time. I've been writing software since I'm 15. I'm now 60. That's 45 years. I don't want to have an expert's mind. I want to have a beginner's mind, and how do I have that beginner's mind? Because those ideas will come at me if I can go, "What could work?" rather than saying, "Oh, I know what is going to work," or, "This is the one thing that is going to definitely work," or, "We have to do this."

(24:10):
As soon as you start using words like that, you know that you're going to completely implode and fail. You have to say, "Here, we have to do all these things." Like in my company right now, we just did this all-hands call. I was like, "There's six things I really want to get done," but one thing is I didn't get everybody focused on Agentforce and really watch the energy. Number two is I need to find more fuel in the company to fuel this idea because this is clearly a breakthrough product, so how do I get everyone focused on it? Number three, where I think it's really important, we need more distribution capability. We don't sell through franchises. We're not selling through dealers, resellers. We sell direct, so I know I need more account executives.

(24:56):
Number four is I need to be telling lots of customer stories. So, number one, customer zero, me, and number two is I need to tell you all the stories. Like, you can see the story of Disney. I'm doing a huge amount of AI work for them and Agentforce work. Let me tell you the story about Disney. I need to tell you that story, and then we have this whole ecosystem of people around the company called Trailblazers, millions of them, who know our platform. They all have to become agentblazers.

(25:23):
The last thing is I just shipped the product into all 135,000 Salesforce customers. So it's their nascent, and they need to flick it on. I need to motivate them to turn it on. These are the six things I'm thinking about all the time. So it's not just one thing. I'm trying to figure out what it is, and I need a beginner's mind to assess how do I move forward, how do I evolve, how do I inspire, how do I motivate, how do I energize.

(26:57):
I love this idea of beginner's mind. I imagine it's very difficult to operationalize, especially for a company at 25 years old at this point. Obviously, you meditate. You put a lot of effort and focus into building this. It's hard to do that within a company. Is there anything you do with meetings, with leadership, with the way you operate that spreads this way of thinking within the org?

Marc Benioff (27:18):
Well, Salesforce is now the second largest software company in the world, but also the second largest software company in Japan, and that's a country where I put a lot of time and energy into. I love going there. I love going to Kyoto. When I go to Kyoto, I like to go to some of these amazing Zen temples. By the way, that's one of the things that Steve Jobs love to do, and he used to go to these great sushi restaurants. There's a great one in Kyoto named Sushiiwa. If you go in there, you'll see he's signed something for them. It says, "All good things. Steve Jobs." I said, "What did he do over here?" He would go to this great sushi restaurant, and then he would go to Ryōan-ji, the Rock Garden Temple. Incredible metaphysical temple.

(28:04):
I've gone there. I've gone there for decades. I've brought a lot of friends of mine there. Yeah. You got to clear your mind and let it come in. You got to receive it. You need to listen. I remember I even brought Neil Young there, the musician. He's one of my favorite people in the world, and obviously, I love his music. His soundtrack is the soundtrack of my entire life. We were sitting there, and he was so deep in meditation, and then he started walking around. The temple was closing, and then he was in the zone, and I didn't want to bother him, but I'm like, "You know, I think we got to go."

(28:38):
Anyway, it turned out he had written a whole album while we were there in his head, and he was basically transcribing it all. This incredible creative process. Look, we're all writing an album in our head. What album are you writing? What music are you writing? How are you getting into that zone yourself? You want to be a great entrepreneur. You want to be a great CEO. You got to clear your mind, and you got to be ready to write that music.

(29:06):
That music could be your business plan, your product plan, your product launch plan like we're talking about for my Agentforce product. That's what we're all trying to do, and I use a place like Kyoto as a place to do that also because geography is important. Where you are matters. I know you're in Marin, so Marin County. Maybe you can go out to the top of Mount Tam. Maybe you go to Spirit Rock with Jack Kornfield and go clear your mind there, but you got to find the place to do that and create the location. It may not be in the office. It may be somewhere else.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:41):
By the way, you have the most amazing friends list. All these folks you mentioned, I've met.

Marc Benioff (29:41):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:49):
I don't know how long this goes. [inaudible 00:29:49].

Marc Benioff (29:48):
They are cool. I am lucky that I've met a lot of cool people. Yeah. I don't know how I got so lucky to meet some of these people.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:53):
I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about... Every month or so, I hear about a startup, I do a bunch of angel investing, that's trying to basically disrupt Salesforce, come after Salesforce. They bash your... don't kill me for saying this, your user experience. They're like, "Oh, so complicated. It's been around three to five years."

Marc Benioff (30:11):
We are too complicated. I agree.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:12):
Okay. I'm curious just what you believe is most contributed to you being able to stay on top and continue to grow. We're recording this today, and your stock is at an all-time high basically even now.

Marc Benioff (30:25):
Wow, I didn't even know that.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:27):
Roughly.

Marc Benioff (30:29):
I actually never look at the stock.

Lenny Rachitsky (30:29):
Okay.

Marc Benioff (30:31):
I find the stock to be very distracting, and I encourage my employees also don't look at the stock because the stock is just a reflection. Money isn't the goal, right? The stock isn't the goal. It's coming at the end of the journey. It's like that's not why we're doing this. The journey is the reward. That's also something Steve Jobs would say all the time. Another bow to Steve Jobs here. I think that this is really important, and I look at myself as a startup.

(31:05):
I am a startup CEO. I'm a startup entrepreneur. I'm still at the beginning of Salesforce. No matter what I'm doing at Salesforce, whether I'm the CEO, I'm sometimes the chair of the board. Like, last week, we had a board meeting. Sometimes I'm a product manager. This is a startup, and we're a 25-year-old, 75,000-person, $38 billion, $300 something billion market cap startup, but we're a startup nonetheless. We have some great products, but we are just starting. As an example, Lenny, we are just starting the digital labor industry, and we have a product called Agentforce, and we are just starting. We are just at the beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (31:47):
I want to bounce around a little bit, but let's talk about Agentforce. I know this is, as you've said, the thing you're most focused on right now. It's a big bet you all are taking. When people hear this word "agent," I think a lot of people are embarrassed to even ask like, "What does that even look like? What is an agent beyond what LLMs are today?" Is there an example you could give of something you've seen that maybe blew your mind of what an agent can do?

Marc Benioff (32:09):
Yeah. I saw it in the movies. I saw it in Minority Report, which was a movie that was co-written by our futurist, Peter Schwartz. Tom Cruise runs into the Gap store, and all of a sudden, it says, "Hey. Hey, Tom. Have you thought about this new shirt? Look at these jeans. You bought this last time. Now, you could try this. You could try that. What about this? What about that?" It knew his history. It understood him. It knew what was going on. This is 20 years ago. This whole store changes digitally to reflect his interest, his ideas, and it's starting to talk to him and work with him.

(32:51):
That is an agent. It isn't just the agent that we saw in the Matrix, Mr. Smith, or whatever it is. It's someone that's working with you, someone. That's an interesting, for you, slip. It's something that is working with you. It could be your piece of software in your phone. It could be a robot that's going to be in your home. It could be your car that knows you, understands your preferences, has an institutional memory of you, and now is helping to advise you.

(33:22):
I'll give you an example that I'm going to... I go into UCSF all the time. I'm actually just getting through an Achilles rupture right now, so I've had a lot of interactions, and the hospital... or you're getting your healthcare, getting your labs done, getting your physical done, getting your scans done, whatever it is. There's always these pre-operative and post-operative or pre-procedure and post-procedure things, and you're getting these phone calls. Every time I get a phone call, I'm like, "Ugh, that probably just cost them a hundred bucks, and we probably could do that a lot cheaper and a lot easier with an agent."

(33:58):
Then, when I talk to my doctors and nurses at UCSF, they're all burnt out post-pandemic because they're scheduling pajama time to go through all their digital messages at night. It's like a lot of this could be done a lot easier with agents and AI, and we're going to make their lives a lot better, a lot easier, simpler. Some of those things that they're doing, they don't need to talk to me about what my cholesterol number is because I got my labs, and the cholesterol number is this number or that number. A lot of this can be done with technology, and then save the parts that are important for them like when I come to see them or I want to have a real, deeper, more empathetic conversation face-to-face with a deeply experienced doctor. That's a whole another opportunity for me.

(34:45):
That is an agent or the agent is like... Here's an example. I had a CT scan, and you have to drink this contrast, and then all of a sudden, the... drink it, but they give it to you through an IV, and then they're taking better pictures. But then, you have to drink water to flush the contrast out of your body. Do you think anyone called me and said, "Hey, did you drink the water?" No, nobody calls me to drink the water. You have to remember. You're on your own in healthcare in the US. So the agent is going to call you and say, "Hey, did you drink the water? Did you take your meds? Do you need to have a repeat lab? Do you need to go see your doctor again?" So the agent is going to be there by your side. So that's an healthcare example. There's a lot of examples that we can probably have.

Lenny Rachitsky (35:25):
There's just a story in The New York Times which isn't about agents specifically. It was about comparing ChatGPT to a doctor where they tested a doctor's ability to diagnose versus a ChatGPT directly or a doctor plus ChatGPT. By far, the best was just ChatGPT, removing the doctor from the equation.

Marc Benioff (35:43):
Yeah. They wrote up a clinical study where they actually did look at, in a semi-peer-reviewed way, that ChatGPT, in many cases, was giving more accurate diagnoses than a doctor because the doctor had a more bias coming in working with the patient. So that's super interesting and I think something that we should probably all look at that study and think about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (36:09):
Speaking of The New York Times, there's actually this quote I found. You did this op-ed talking about AI. So the quote is, "Throughout my career in Silicon Valley, I've witnessed numerous waves of innovation, but none compared to the profound impact of AI. AI is the defining technology of our lifetime and probably any lifetime." When was the moment for you where you started to realize this where it's like, "Oh shit, this is not just another cool toy?"

Marc Benioff (36:33):
Well, I keep having these existential freakout moments about AI, and it's happened over a series of decades. But for those of us who grew up with these movies like WarGames and Minority Report or Her or... across the board or read some of these books. One of my favorite books on AI is Ghost Fleet. You think about, "Where are we going with AI? Where are we going with AI?" With Salesforce, I think about our journey, and I've been waiting for this to happen and trying to bring us along, especially in the last decade with the development of our Einstein platform, and now the development of our Agentforce platform.

(37:18):
This week, at Salesforce, we'll probably do about 2 trillion AI transactions. With our total now, Einstein and Agentforce platforms, we're definitely the largest provider of enterprise AI transactions in the world as far as I could tell, and I keep thinking, "Wow, this is going to get more and more intense." One step was we had to automate all these customer touch points. So like wearing my Disney fanboy shirt here, we run the Disney Store and the Disney Guides, and there's Disney Real Estate, and there's the DisneyQuest call center, and there's... Every aspect of Disney. When you're a customer, you're interfacing with Salesforce.

(38:00):
So that's what we've loved doing, automating all these customer touch points: sales, service, marketing, analytics, Slack, integrating it all with MuleSoft. That's what we do, and then aggregating it all into a big database where we call it data cloud, and then federating that data cloud to other data sources. So that's the two steps we've been doing, automate the customer touch points, aggregate the data, and then step three is the agentic platform on top of that.

(38:29):
When you think about what's happening now that you can go to help.salesforce.com and have your issues resolved with that on the agentic layer, that's amazing. Then, the fourth layer that will come will be the robotic drone layer where those robots and drones will then feed off of the platform and all of these capabilities. That vision of the future is something that we've all had in the industry for years. It's not my magic vision. This is a vision that's been around. It's been the fundamentals of computer science that we would move from having... We'd go from data to automation, and that is what we're all driving, and we're driving that industry. We're going lower cost, easier to use, and more automated constantly. That's powerful. This is really moving fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:21):
You mentioned Einstein briefly. I'll also mention my dog is named Einstein, and I got Einstein swag once with the socks, and I love them, so. Also, that's also an example of you bought einstein.com very early.

Marc Benioff (39:33):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:34):
That was another domain name that you owned.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Well, I just thought Einstein would be a great name to talk about artificial intelligence, and it really has been. There. You can see him behind me right on my shelf, on my bookshelf. I keep him back there. You see Einstein? I think they were [inaudible 00:39:50].

Lenny Rachitsky (39:36):
My view is blocked.

Marc Benioff (39:36):
Oh, I'll go grab him.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:52):
Totally. Okay. Let's check it out.

Marc Benioff (39:54):
There he is. Ugh.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:55):
Show and tell Segment in the podcast.

Marc Benioff (39:55):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:59):
Oh, cute.

Marc Benioff (40:00):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:00):
That's a big old Einstein.

Marc Benioff (40:02):
That's a key part of our vision for Salesforce, our Einstein platform was everything we're doing. We wouldn't get to Agentforce without getting to good old Einstein here.

Lenny Rachitsky (40:12):
Very cute. As you talk about all this, I imagine many people are thinking, "Oh shit, we're not going to have as many people working. What are we going to do with our jobs? AI as agents." I know anything you say could be taken way out of context and just like, "Marc Benioff says everyone is not working," but I guess just... I know you've said you're not going to be hiring as many engineers next year. I guess anything there to help people understand how the workforce will change in the future?

Marc Benioff (40:35):
Well, I can tell you about my own company and what I'm telling my own employees, which is that, yeah, we're going to have to rebalance some of our workforce because you can see it in the numbers I just gave you which is we need less support engineers because we have a robotic support layer with Agentforce. So that is very real, and we all need to adapt. At the same time, I'm hiring a lot more account executives and folks to grow the company. So I just encouraged everybody on the all-hands call to think about that.

(41:06):
Then, I just gave you the idea of healthcare. The interesting thing about healthcare though is that a lot of the jobs that I think that are going to get created just... we don't have people for, and I think there's a lot of things that we need help with in the world that we don't have people for. So I think a lot of these jobs will not necessarily get replaced, and I think that... I have a home in a small town, and in this small town... It's very much a blue-collar town. Folks are still working in the restaurants, driving trucks, working in the supermarket, and working on their homes, building, construction, gardening.

(41:56):
Look, it's going to be a long time before, I think, jobs in the small town where I have a home will ever get impacted. But in the large town where I have a home, San Francisco, well, then I just gave you an example where I think that jobs will get impacted. So it'll be a tale of two cities, literally, and I think you will see different impacts in different places.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:21):
So what I'm hearing there is support people trending down, account executive sales trending up?

Marc Benioff (42:27):
Right now, that is Salesforce in a nutshell.

Lenny Rachitsky (42:31):
That touches on something I wanted to touch on also which is that you're... A lot of founders today are very product-minded, very product-oriented founders, and they want to build product-first companies, grow product-led, all these things. Salesforce, I think, very publicly, is very sales-led, very marketing-led, not product-led. Obviously, product is a core part of it, and it all works together, and all these things. But I guess just any advice for founders that are very product-oriented and maybe are hesitant to lean into sales, into cust-

Marc Benioff (42:57):
Yeah. I would say we're not sales-led. Well, I think let's just use Agentforce as an example, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
Mm.

Marc Benioff (43:01):
So we're running the year, we're running this year. This is our fiscal year 25. Okay? It ends in the end of January next year. Lenny, this is the year of data cloud. This was not supposed to be the year of Agentforce. So it's the year of data cloud. I just gave you the pitch. We've automated all the customer touch points. Now, we're adding the data cloud to all of our customer implementations. We have 135,000 customers. We've implemented data cloud into all of them. They all need to turn it on. Our teams need to show our customers how to build data cloud and how it's going to help our customers have a better data structure. I almost combined "beta" and "data" together. So they need a better data structure, data architectures, data cultures.

(43:51):
Then, we had our breakthrough, and I can tell you the story where all of a sudden, I'm like, "Wow, this agent technology is happening much faster than I thought it was going to, and we are going to market now." By the time we get to Dreamforce, we are going to take this incredible technology. We accelerated it radically because we bought this company called Airkit, which is one of our Ohana... It's a great story.

(44:18):
Great entrepreneur have this company, fantastic company called RelateIQ that we bought many years ago, about 10 years ago, stayed with us for many years, like six or seven years, wanted to leave, and we said, "Great." We gave them the investment to leave, invested in the company through Salesforce Ventures, built this amazing platform, and then we said, "Now, we want to buy it back." Then, he came back about a year ago, and then it just accelerated the agent vision, and then we delivered Agentforce production code at the end of October. So, all of a sudden, now, we are releasing this product.

(44:56):
I think it's very important, if you're an entrepreneur, to realize it's not just about the product. It's not just about sales. It's not just about marketing. It's not just about accounting. It's not just about your investors. It's not just about your employees. It's not just about your stakeholders. It's about everything, so you better be ready to be an orchestra leader. You can't just be playing the clarinet.

(45:20):
I think that's what you're getting to, which is that there's entrepreneurs who are like, "I'm just going to play the clarinet." For those, I don't think they're going to go as far as they could go. You want to be playing the whole symphony, and you want to get everyone running. That symphony is sales, service, marketing, product. Every part of your shareholders, your stakeholders, your customers. You have to be constantly playing the whole symphony, and you have to have a big mind to think about, "Whoa, I have a lot of stakeholders in my company, not just one stakeholder." It's not just about product and technology. If you're going to narrowcast yourself, you're doing a disservice not just to yourself, but to everybody else as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (46:02):
Speaking of big mind and beginner's mind, we have a recurring segment on this podcast that I call Fail Corner. Where it comes from is people come on this podcast, they share all these stories of, "Everything is going great. We're killing it. I've had all these successes," and people get discouraged because they hear just people only succeeding when they often fail. So I try to ask guests to share a story, and let me ask you this. Is there a story you could share when it was a big struggle for you when you're struggling when something went super wrong that you worked through and learned something from?

Marc Benioff (46:35):
Sure. Well, I'll just give this example. About two years ago, we went through this huge transformation in our company, and there were a lot of crazy things that were happening, but it was a little bit like we're all on this Airplane, and everything is going really well. Then, something seems to be going really wrong, and we look up front, and the two pilots seemed to be missing. Then, the one guy with the parachute jumped out of the plane, and then we're all like, "Whoa, what are we going to do?" We had to do some really crazy and somewhat destructive things at the moment to basically get the regeneration of the company.

(47:12):
One of those things that we did two years ago was we had to architect a layoff, and we had never done a scaled layoff before. We had to lay off 10% of the company to save the company, and I didn't want to do it. I mean, it's the last thing I want to do as an entrepreneur, which is to adjust our headcount, but we were coming out of the pandemic, and we had just hired too many people.

(47:33):
Now, it turned out that a lot of companies in Silicon Valley all did that same maneuver during the pandemic. Things were so robust in the pandemic that we were overhiring. By the time the pandemic was over, we had too many people. I mean, what did I know? It was my first pandemic. All of a sudden, my next pandemic, I'll know that there's an economic cycle associated with it and an inflation cycle too.

(47:58):
So I learned a lot in the pandemic, and now, we're here. Now, all of a sudden, we're architecting two years ago this layoff. Then, when we did the layoff, then I'm trying to overcommunicate. I'm having all employee meetings. It's a complete dumpster fire. It's a nightmare. I'm getting bashed in the press, on Twitter. Everyone is shooting at me. It's like, "Oh, boy." If I had a thick skin, it got a lot thicker during that moment because it's never going to go well no matter what, and it didn't go well but we got through it to the point where you're giving me these accolades, wonderful, on this podcast about where we are today financially and from a structural standpoint or now from product innovation standpoint, but that's not where we were two years ago.

(48:51):
It was clear we had to go through a financial transformation, which included an adjustment of our head count, and we had to go through a technology, and a product, and an innovation transformation. Those two things were going to require us to do a number of things, and they were going to be painful. So we all had to go through some of that pain to get the gain that we have now, and that was not easy.

(49:17):
I was in shock that I was going through this two years ago because I had already been running the company for 23 years. Things were going pretty well. Yes, there were a lot of failures during that period. I just didn't expect another massive issue to hit me. But guess what? There're constantly massive issues coming at you, and there's more coming, and that's the nature.

(49:39):
My friend, Michael Bell, is probably the best entrepreneur I know. He says, "There is no linear success." So what that means is that stock chart that you just referred to, there's no up-and-to-the-right perfect chart where it's just one line. I don't care who you are. Apple doesn't have one. No one has one. Okay? There's going to be changes. It could be economic changes. It could be societal changes. It could be the pandemic. There's no up-and-to-the-right. If you think it's only going to be about up and to the right, you're in the wrong business or you have the wrong life. Right? Hey, the monastic life is maybe more for you where you're just out living in that more of that steady state. Right? But if you want more variation where it's not steady state, the entrepreneurial life is a rock-and-roll roller coaster, and you get ready because it's going to be pounding you all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (50:33):
One of these people that you described that jumped out of the airplane speaking on the roller coaster ride is your co-CEO, Bret Taylor. What's interesting to me is he's also all-in on agents, and what it makes me think about is there's this meme of what did Ilya see when he left and tried to kick out Sam Altman. I'm curious just like what did you guys see about agents being the future that you're both so committed to this? So interesting.

Marc Benioff (50:54):
Well, I just think that this idea that agents are one of the most important things that we're all going to work on, and I think everyone is going to go to agents. Look, I just heard about Google today has Agentspace. At first, I was like, "Well, I guess they like the Agentforce name." I love Sundar. He's one of my favorite people in the world. We heard Microsoft now has agents. I read Oracle has agents now. SAP has agents. Everybody's got agents, and good. That's what we want. We don't want to be the only one.

(51:30):
If you're the only one and no one else is working on it, you've got a problem, actually. So you don't want to be the only one. You want to be in a market. You don't want to be one company offering a solution and the only one. You want to be in a competitive market where people are competing with you, and you're selling against somebody else, and you're getting better, and you're moving forward. It's like the automobile industry. One of my favorite people is Akio Toyoda. Toyoda-san was now the Chairman of Toyota, was the CEO of Toyota. His grandfather started Toyota. He says, "Better, better, better. Never best." It's the Japanese motto of Kaizen.

(52:10):
So we talked about Japanese Shoshin, which means beginner's mind. Now, we're learning another Japanese word here, Kaizen. Kaizen is continuous improvement, and you need to be doing continuous improvement. With where we are right now with agents, every software industry is going to move to agents. We have to just like every software industry... Well, at least in CRM or automating customer touchpoints, data and managing data, and building that data infrastructure, agents. It's all related. We're all moving in the same direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (52:47):
I'm just thinking as a founder, you're just like, "Goddamn, I just got used to AI, and everyone is wanting to work on AI in my company. Now, we got to freaking figure out agents?"

Marc Benioff (52:54):
No, no, no, no, no. That's a mistake. That is the mindset you want. You want that mindset. You want the mindset of, "Oh, the next thing is coming. I can't wait for the next thing." In some ways, you have to be saying, "I can't wait for the next failure. I can't wait for the next success. I can't wait for the next innovation." Oh, well, that's innovation overall, right?

(53:18):
See, we're in an industry where technology is constantly getting lower cost, easier to use, and more automated. So if you're doing for two and a half decades, or four decades, or four and a half decades now that I've been doing it... When I started in this industry, I started on a computer called the TRS-80 Model I with 4K of RAM. I was doing a podcast recently, and they're like, "Well, who did you sell your first piece of software to?" I said, "Well, I sold it to CLOAD Magazine in Goleta, California and-

Lenny Rachitsky (53:54):
For $75.

Marc Benioff (53:54):
For $75, and they said, "Thank you for..." and then they said, "Oh, that's great, and did you send them the disk?" I'm like, "No, no. There was no disk. CLOAD standard for Cassette Load in BASIC. That was the command in BASIC, C-L-O-A-D, Cassette Load, CLOAD. That was the command. So that was the name of their magazine, and then you would get the cassette every month with five or six things that they had bought from people like me." I mean, they didn't know they were buying it from a 15-year-old kid in high school in Burlingame High School California. But I had written the How to Juggle thing, and they bought it for $75. They sent me the one-page agreement, and I signed it. Then, I told my parents, and they're like, "What? Huh? You're doing what? Oh, okay. That's nice, honey. Great job."

(54:45):
So they didn't understand. Nobody knew. It was crazy. It was like 1979 or 1978, so nobody knew I was selling software. I was in high school. It was just a moment in time, but I need to have that mindset all the way along which is, "What is the next great thing? What is the next great success? What is the next great failure?" You're growing. You're evolving. You're learning from that. That's what you want. You want to have that growth mindset. Right? You want to embrace that. Does it make sense what I said?

Lenny Rachitsky (55:21):
Absolutely.

Marc Benioff (55:22):
I jumped on that one little thought. "Oh, gee, yeah. I've got this now under control, but now I've got agents, so now, what am I going to..." It's like, "No, that's what you want." By the way, I want what's after that too, and what's after that, and what's after that. That's what's really exciting about the future. It's coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (55:43):
Why?

Marc Benioff (55:43):
I want to be... One of our customers said this, and people think I said it. It wasn't me. I want to get to the future first and welcome our customers there. That's what I think is... By the way, that's what I think Elon Musk does so well. He is like... I don't know all the crazy things he's doing to see the future. He's clearly doing some unusual things, but then he's like, "Yeah, we're going to have robots in the future, and brain machine interfaces, and driving electric cars. All of these things are going to be happening in the future, and I'm going to have 10 companies that are going to do all of them." Wow.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:23):
He's not only thinking about it, he's doing them each.

Marc Benioff (56:26):
Amazing,

Lenny Rachitsky (56:27):
Amazing.

Marc Benioff (56:27):
No one like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:29):
Yeah.

Marc Benioff (56:29):
Never seen anything like it. I don't understand how it is even possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:34):
Same. Marc, I know you have to run. This was incredible. I think this is a beautiful place to end it.

Marc Benioff (56:40):
Oh, Lenny, you're so much fun. I've been looking forward to being on your podcast and talk about entrepreneurship, and thanks for everything you're doing for the industry and for entrepreneurs everywhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:49):
Same, Marc Benioff.

Marc Benioff (56:50):
We're all so grateful to you. Goodbye now, and welcome.

Lenny Rachitsky (56:53):
I feel the same. Thank you. Bye. Bye, everyone.

# How to speak more confidently and persuasively | Matt Abrahams (professor, speaker, author)

## Transcript

Matt Abrahams (00:00:00):
Visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking, but getting up to the stage, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time, and there's good research to say that this desensitizes people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):
Most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk.

Matt Abrahams (00:00:20):
You actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:00:34):
Strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just answer the question. Just give the feedback. Just be engaged in the small talk. By doing that, you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Matt Abrahams. Matt is a professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business where he teaches a very popular class on communication and public speaking. He's also the host of the incredibly popular podcast, Think Fast, Talk Smart; and the author of the very popular book, Think Faster and Talk Smarter. Matt also coaches people one-on-one on public speaking and communication skills. And in our conversation we focus on the two areas that people most need help with. One, reducing their anxiety before and during any form of public speaking, and getting better at speaking on the spot, including giving better toasts, giving feedback, doing Q&A, and even apologizing.

(00:01:36):
Like we talk about in the actual conversation, speaking well is a superpower in your career for interviewing, for being great in meetings, for pitching your manager on ideas, to leading teams. And the skill becomes even more important as you grow in your career. The good news is that you can get better at it with a bit of help. I've worked on this a lot over the course of my career and I still get really nervous before big talks and even before every podcast episode, but many of these techniques I actually put into practice and I share that in our conversation. If you pick just a couple things from this episode to put into practice, you'll become a better communicator, you'll be less nervous, and you'll get better at dealing with on-the-spot moments.

(00:04:50):
Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:04:54):
Lenny, I am excited for our conversation and thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
Thank you for being here. I'm even more excited for the conversation. So what I want to do with our time today is there's two areas I want to focus. One is talking about techniques to help people manage anxiety when public speaking. And two is helping people get better at speaking on the spot, which you wrote a whole book about. And if you think about it, I think that's like most of the public speaking we do is on the spot. It's not often you give a prepared talk. It's usually like you said, Q&A or a or toast someone wants to give you or ask for feedback or things like that. So I'm excited to dig into those things. How do that sound broadly?

Matt Abrahams (00:05:33):
Absolutely, I look forward to that and those are topics I'm very excited to talk about, have done a lot of research in and look forward to sharing more.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):
I suspected as much. Okay, so let's talk about anxiety. You have a bunch of really novel techniques in your book and your podcast for calming your body down, calming your mind down when you're planning to give a talk, when you're actually about to give a talk, when you're giving a talk. And a lot of these I haven't actually seen anywhere else and I've used a few of them and they are really great. So what I was thinking we'd do is let me go through the ones that I found most useful and interesting and just share your advice on those and then see if there's any I missed and then maybe add those at the end. How's that?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:15):
That sounds great. That sounds great. I love that you've applied some of these techniques and found value from them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:19):
I'll talk about this, I'll talk about this. Okay, first of all, just to catch on this, you're not a fan of the picture people in your audience naked approach, correct?

Matt Abrahams (00:06:27):
The Brady Bunch advice is not good advice. I don't know about you and I don't know anybody who could imagine seeing a bunch of people in their underwear and feel more comfortable with that. And I think if you do, there are other issues you need to be dealing with than beyond speaking anxiety.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:42):
Yeah, it feels like highly inappropriate now, just that idea, trying to picture everyone-

Matt Abrahams (00:06:46):
No, but underlying that if you'll give me a moment, there is some value. This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
Well, let's actually talk about this one while we're on it because I think this is a really powerful technique. An idea just to kind of summarize, you picture ahead of time, what it's going to look like and feel like. You talking, looking at the audience. You talk about that and just how to go about using that technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:07:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And this is some of the oldest research on public speaking anxiety. It was research done in the '80s from the University of Oregon. So visualization, what it does is it allows you to see the event in a way that you have much more control over it so you can think about it. So a good visualization involves some deep breathing to calm yourself. Either you close your eyes or you just look at a picture. Maybe you can get a picture of the environment you're speaking in. I often recommend speakers see the room even if they're not physically present, but get a picture online or some way envision yourself in the room, envision yourself in the room with the people you'll be speaking to. Often we know the individuals or some of them. We can also go online and figure out who they are.

(00:08:39):
So visualization is a really useful technique and you see yourself not just in the moment of speaking but getting up to the stage, delivering the presentation, seeing it being well received, thinking about how you step off the stage. And by taking yourself through that you in essence are a dress rehearsal even though you're not physically in the room. And there's good research to say that this desensitizes people. We see athletes do this kind of thing all the time where they'll do visualization to help them and it really does work. And like I said, there are virtual tools now that can help you do this where you can actually program it to have a certain size audience. You can even program some of these to have a responsive audience or a distracted audience. All of this in service of just preparing you for what you're really going to see.

(00:09:25):
And the bottom line is this, what you're doing for yourself is making sure it's not new and novel. It's something been there, done that, even though if it was virtual or visualized in your mind, to help you feel better about the circumstance. It gives you a sense of agency.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
I've done this myself actually. I gave a TEDx talk once and it was probably the scariest talk I've ever given and I spent a lot of time doing this and it doesn't actually have to take that much time. It could be like a five-minute thing where you sit down, calm yourself, and then just picture the stuff. And ideally you do it a couple times, I imagine.

Matt Abrahams (00:09:57):
That's right. Good for you. And congratulations on giving a TEDx talk. That is a high-stakes talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):
Thank you. That was before TEDx became super uncool. It was still pretty early. It's out there in the internet in case people want to find it.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:09):
Don't say they're uncool. I'm doing one in two weeks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:11):
They're so cool. That is, they are cool.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:13):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
They're incredible. I'm impressed.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:17):
I've done a number of them and I've coached many people and I think that there's a lot of value that they can provide people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
There is. There is. I think they've just become slightly less cool because now there's a lot of them, but they're still incredibly cool, I'm very proud.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:29):
Okay, thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:31):
So on the visualization piece, I think we have a lot of techniques, but just on this one, part of it is continue to calm yourself as you're doing it. I think that's really important because you want to help your body not connect to the stress that you're feeling like you're going to experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:10:46):
That's correct. Any distance you can give yourself from the anxiety that you're feeling is helpful and there are lots of techniques that help give you a little bit of distance and visualization is one of those.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:57):
One of my favorite techniques that it might be in this bucket, it might be on the spot advice bucket, but I think it works great here is what you call dare to be dull. Can you talk about that because I love that?

Matt Abrahams (00:11:09):
Yeah. I really leaned into this with the spontaneous speaking work that I've been doing as of late, but it applies to anybody speaking. This is a notion that comes from the world of improvisation and when people hear improv, they often think of standup comedy, having to be funny. And that's not what improv is all about. Improv is all about being present, being collaborative, being open, and it's a wonderful tool just to help you get present oriented. Think of it as like meditation in action, but also it teaches lots of valuable skills for communication.

(00:11:42):
When we communicate, especially spontaneously, we want to do it really well. We want to answer the question with the best answer, we want to give the right feedback, we want to be the most interesting in small talk and that puts a lot of pressure on ourselves. And you can think of it this way, it's really taxing our cognitive bandwidth.

(00:12:04):
Your brain in many ways is like a CPU, a computer. It's not a perfect analogy, but it works. And if I am constantly judging and evaluating everything I am saying against some standard of perfection, whatever that is, it means I have a limited amount of bandwidth to focus on what I'm actually saying and connecting to my audience. If you have a laptop or a phone that has lots of windows and apps open, each one of those is performing less well because of the other ones being open. So I often say strive for connection over perfection by daring to be dull. Just get the task done, just answer the question, just give the feedback, just be engaged in the small talk. And by doing that you dial down the volume of self-evaluation, freeing up resources that can be used to really help you succeed. So dare to be dull is all about giving yourself permission to just be present and do what's needed. And when you do that you find that you actually do quite a good job at it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
The last point I think is really important, you talk about this in your book. Is when you start with, "Okay, I'm just going to say something, it'll be fine." Without that pressure, you end up saying something better and more interesting and more insightful because you're less nervous about it.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:16):
That's exactly right. We are often our biggest impediments to good communication because of the anxiety we bring to the party.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
That's awesome. And I think this can apply to prepared talks too. When you're preparing a deck, don't put this pressure on yourself, "This has to be the best talk ever." Just like, "I'm going to do my best. Let me just start with something that's good enough." People learn something and then from that, their editing ends up leading to something great in my experience.

Matt Abrahams (00:13:39):
Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:40):
Awesome. Okay, let's go to the next technique, and this is another one I've practiced and another guest on the podcast actually suggested this and these two remind me of using this one, which is to tell yourself when you're going to be giving a talk. "I'm excited. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so excited to give this talk." And reframe it from, "I'm nervous," to like, "No, I'm excited. This is going to be amazing." Can you talk about that technique?

Matt Abrahams (00:14:04):
Absolutely. So this is one of many cognitive reframing techniques. It is often attributed to my friend and colleague, Alison Wood Brooks, she's at Harvard Business School who did some research into this. And what she found is...

(00:14:18):
Well, first take a step back. When you get physically aroused by anxiety, you're under that fight or flight threat response. It turns out that same response happens to your body when you're excited. The human body has pretty much just one arousal response. Our heart beats faster, we breathe more shallow, we get a little shaky, but the big difference is how we label that. So if I say, "Hey Lenny, guess what? Your colleague couldn't show up today and you need to go teach the class or you need to go give that presentation." You might feel your heart rate go up, get a little shaky, sweat on your brow and you're seeing that as negative. But if I said, "Hey Lenny, guess what? You just won the lottery." Same physiological response would happen, but you would see that likely as more positive.

(00:15:06):
So how we label the arousal matters and what Alison's research and others have followed up with suggests is that when we feel those symptoms of anxiety, rather than seeing it as negative, say, "This is exciting. I get to share my point of view. I get to demonstrate my value." And in so doing by seeing it as more positive, it causes us by definition to relax. And her research fascinatingly found that people actually were perceived as communicating better. And again that's because that pressure was taken off of them. So I challenge everybody to think about what are the exciting elements of the communication opportunities you have and really lean into those. And when you feel those anxiety symptoms, remind yourself these are signs of excitement. This is me being excited about sharing this information and it can really help.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
This is another one I've done and it super works. It sounds so trivial and so like, "Why would this do anything?" But I find you just say that just like, "I'm going to have so much fun. This is going to be exciting." It does make an impact. So another one to try, even though it sounds really trivial.

(00:16:12):
Kind of along these lines, there's another technique you recommend which is a mantra, having a mantra that you repeat to yourself. I don't know if it's kind of the same general idea, but you have a couple mantras that you recommend to people like "I have value to add" and things like that. What advice do you have there?

Matt Abrahams (00:16:27):
Yes, thank you. And that's mine. The one that you shared is, "I have value to add." So if we were to really listen to the voice in our heads when it comes to communication, we say a lot of negative things to ourselves. We say things like, "I'm not prepared. I'm not going to be as good as this person. I'm an imposter." We carry around with us a lot of this chatter that actually sets us up to not do well or to be more nervous. So if we can actually change that talk track, it can help us.

(00:17:01):
I'm not saying you have to go to an extreme and say, "I'm going to be the best communicator ever." Rather you can simply say as I do and as you alluded to. What I'll say right before I speak is, "I have value to bring."

(00:17:12):
Often when we are in communicative situations, especially at work, people want to hear from us. We've been invited to speak, we're on the agenda for the meeting. There is value people can take from our communication and we just have to remind ourselves of that. So having some little mantra that you can say that's not over the top but just makes sense. It could be as simple as you've got this, or I'm prepared, or I know my stuff. And I actually encourage people to write it on a post-it note if you're old school, sometimes people put it into their phones as a reminder. So like a minute or two minutes before they're set to give the presentation or participate in the meeting, it flashes up. We just have to turn off or turn down the noise of that internal negative self-talk.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):
What are some other mantras that you found helpful or that people use?

Matt Abrahams (00:18:03):
They're very personal to different people. I was just coaching a senior leader the other day who his mantra was, "Last time this went well." He's a leader, he does a lot of the same presentations and just by saying last time this went well, reminds him that it's likely to go well this time. We are very susceptible to catastrophizing when we're very nervous about things, especially when we're exposed in front of people. Not in the Brady Bunch exposure we talked about earlier, but when we're out there speaking or communicating and simply reminding ourselves that often they go very well is helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
Yeah. There's another one that I think you shared which is, "It's not about me, it's about my content."

Matt Abrahams (00:18:41):
Yes, exactly. That's another one. That's a great one. It can be very helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):
The one you shared about, "I've got this," reminds me, my wife took a course with the Artist's Way writer, Julia Cameron I think is her name. And she has this piece of advice where you name your critic, your inner critic that's always telling you to stop doing stuff. You name him or her. So I name mine Jim. And then when he or she is giving you things you don't want to hear, you're just like, "Jim, I got this. Jim, I don't need this advice."

Matt Abrahams (00:19:11):
There is a lot of evidence on personifying the things that challenge us and then having conversations with it. It's a way of rationalizing some of the things that we do that are quite negative. So something there for sure to be thinking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:30):
There we go. Bonus advice. That was-

Matt Abrahams (00:19:32):
Bonus advice, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):
I didn't expect that.

Matt Abrahams (00:19:34):
And the cool thing that what you're highlighting is there is a lot of advice out there on how to manage anxiety. Many of us feel like we're the only people who feel this nervous because we see our colleagues, our friends or Ted talks as you were talking about, and we see these people communicating just so effortlessly. Often a lot of work went into that and we don't see that work. And sometimes just knowing that others experience it makes us feel better.

(00:19:58):
If you'll allow me, I'll tell this very quick story. I was in the San Francisco Airport, this was several years ago after my Speaking Up Without Freaking Out book came out, and my name was called over the PA system at the airport counter. The seat that I was supposed to sit in was broken and they wanted to talk to me about it. So when I came away from that, somebody came up to me and said, "Hey, you're the guy that wrote that book on speaking anxiety." I said, "Yes." And I said, "What do you know about it?" He goes, "Oh, I bought the book." I said, "Oh, was it helpful?" He says, "Incredibly helpful, but I didn't read it." I'm like, "This is weird. So you're telling me the book was helpful and you didn't read it?" And so I said, "Tell me more." And he said, "Just knowing that a book like that existed made me feel better because I don't know you and I know you certainly didn't write the book for me. So it implies that lots of people have this issue."

(00:20:44):
And just by normalizing the anxiety, which by the way is the normal condition. Those of us who study this believe it is innate to being human to feel nervous communicating in front of others. So sometimes just reminding yourself that you're not alone and that others have it can actually help reduce the pressure that we feel.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):
This is such an important point that I am kicking myself for not starting with this also because I think this is something people don't realize. They see all their execs at their company speaking incredibly well, so confidently, so articulately and just like, "Oh my God, how will I ever be someone like that?" Is there anything more you can share of just like you have tons of students that go through your class, you see these issues, they're more transparent, you think about their challenges, I imagine. Is there anything more you could share there to help people feel better? Like this is most people, even when you see someone amazing at speaking, they are also probably nervous.

Matt Abrahams (00:21:36):
With regard to that, I think we just need to talk about it more. We need to share about it. I mean, I always will share that I still have anxiety in speaking in certain situations and it's something that's taken me a long time to work on. I also help people understand that it's not a light switch. It's not like you either have it or you don't. It's a process. And so the idea is over time, we will feel less nervous if we apply some of these principles you and I are talking about.

(00:22:01):
A great technique to help people that often isn't talked about is many of us feel much more comfortable in conversation than we do in presenting. And conversation is a back and forth. So you can actually set up a lot of your communication situations, a presentation, a meeting, et cetera, as conversations. And you don't even have to have a conversation with the audience. You can simply have it with yourself. For example, what would it be like if you were to start a presentation by saying, "Today I have three questions I'd like to answer. Question number one is..." And you state the question and then you answer it. I am actually having a conversation with myself in that moment where I am asking myself a question. I happen to know the answer, I give the answer. This again, just like the reframing as excitement versus anxiety, this is a reframe. I'm not presenting, I'm having a conversation. And in so doing it ratchets down that anxiety.

(00:22:53):
So we need to talk about it. We need to share our experiences with developing anxiety management plans. We realize it's not binary, it's not I have it or I don't. And we start seeing where we feel more comfortable and how can we bring that comfort level into the types of situations that make us nervous, like simply having a conversation with yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:13):
You have another technique I think that's different, maybe it's exactly the same, which is to ask a question of somebody else as you're talking, which is I think deflects attention from you. Can you talk about that?

Matt Abrahams (00:23:22):
Yeah. So we talked about the way we desensitize through visualization. The other thing we can do is distract.

(00:23:30):
I coached a very senior leader at Google who got very nervous when he was up in front of people, and what we did is we distract his audience. So he would start every single presentation saying these words, "Good morning, let's watch this video." And he'd show a 30-second video that was on topic about something they were going to talk about in the meeting. And when the video stopped, he would then facilitate a discussion of what that video was about and then he would ease into his content. So he went from being a presenter to being a facilitator or somebody who was having a conversation with the audience. That made him feel so much better.

(00:24:05):
And so all of us can do things that can distract our audience. Now when I say distract, I don't mean take them on a tangent that's not relevant to what you're saying, but maybe you ask them a question, maybe you tell them a story, maybe you show them a video or ask them to read something. So there are lots of things that you can do that will help get the attention off you for just a little bit so that you can then focus on what works for you or take that deep breath that'll help calm you down. All of these are very useful techniques.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:35):
Yeah, it's interesting once you start talking, it's okay usually. It's the beginning part that you need [inaudible 00:24:40].

Matt Abrahams (00:24:40):
Yeah, most people are most nervous one minute before speaking and the first minute of speaking. And if you can find ways to get yourself through that, then it becomes much easier for most people. There are some people who that's not true for, but for most people that's the way it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):
Awesome. Okay, next technique that actually another guest mentioned, and we spent a bunch of time on this, a guest named Johnny Miller, which is a breathing technique. And just to give a little context from what he taught us is that 80% of our neurons go from our body to our brain versus 20% is our brain telling our body what to feel. And so this research shows that what our body's feeling is what our brain's going to think. So if our body's acting nervous, we're going to think, oh, we're nervous. And if you change the state of your body, your mind feels different.

Matt Abrahams (00:25:23):
I love this stuff. This research, embodied cognition is what it's called, is fascinating to me. I'll share one of my most favorite studies in this. There was a researcher at Duke, I think it was Duke, who... The only experimental variation that he did is he had people hold something that was cold in their hand, like an iced coffee versus a warm coffee. And then he asked the participants to make ratings of people. And if you were holding something cold, you saw the person as a colder person, as more aloof and more distant, and if you were holding something warm, you saw them as more collaborative and embracing. I find this stuff fascinating. What our body feels, our minds think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
Awesome. So along those lines, there's a technique that you recommend that he recommended, but I think it's a great reminder of the double exhale where you breathe in and then you exhale twice as long. Can you talk about that and tell people about it?

Matt Abrahams (00:26:13):
Yeah. Breathing is very helpful in managing so many of our anxiety symptoms. It slows down the heart rate, makes our voice sound more normal because when we get nervous, we breathe shallow and that changes... Our voice is a wind instrument, it changes the way we sound, can reduce some of the shakiness. So deep belly breathing, the kind you do if you've ever done yoga or tai chi, qigong, really important to do and there are a whole bunch of variations on it. The one you're talking about is the double inhalation where you're taking an inhale in until you feel completely full and then you sneak in a little extra air and then you take a long exhale. People call it box breathing and other types of breathing.

(00:26:54):
The bottom line is this, what's critical to the relaxation response is the exhale. Lots of ways to inhale, lots of ways to exhale. You want your exhale to be longer than the inhale. The magic of the relaxation happens during the exhale. So I have a rule of thumb, I jokingly call it a rule of lung. You want your exhale to be twice as long as your inhale. So if you take a three count in, even if you sneak in a little extra air as we were talking about, take a six count out. And it is that way that you will feel... Not only will your body physiologically feel less stress, you'll be more focused in a present moment and not catastrophizing about all the things that might happen in the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:36):
Great. Yeah, so it's like another example of this sounds so trivial and why would breathing differently do have any impact on my nervousness? But one, there's all this research that shows that it does, and two, if you try it, and this is another one I use, is it actually works very quickly and you do it a few times and like, wow, I feel really different.

Matt Abrahams (00:27:54):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:55):
It is interesting you put these together. From the way I've seen it, these are two different techniques, but I've never tried them together. One is... I think Huberman is big on this one. All his clips are always talking about this. One of you inhale fully and then you inhale a little bit more and there's some capillaries or something in your lungs that fill up that-

Matt Abrahams (00:28:12):
[inaudible 00:28:12]. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):
And then there's the 4, 4, 8 is the way this other guest shared is like breathe in four seconds, hold it four seconds, breathe out for eight seconds. But I'm going to try both. Wow. That's going to double up my calmness.

Matt Abrahams (00:28:27):
You'll be so mellow, nothing will bother you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:29):
So mellow. Okay. Are there any other techniques that you love that you find people find really helpful in calming their anxiety?

Matt Abrahams (00:28:39):
Well, so the first book had 50 techniques and not all 50 techniques work for everybody. One that I personally think is a lot of fun is getting present oriented because when I'm in the present, by definition I'm not worried about the future. And many of our anxiety comes from our fear of a potential negative future outcome like, "I'm not going to achieve my goal." So if I can do anything to be in the present moment, that helps me out a lot.

(00:29:02):
Something I do as part of my personal anxiety management plan is I say tongue twisters. Tongue twisters for me are a great way to get present oriented. You can't say it right if you don't say the tongue twister if you're not focused on the present moment. And it also warms up your voice. A lot of nervous speakers get so inside their head that they don't warm up their voice. And we all know if you've ever done any exercise or competed in any sports, you should warm up first. We have this mistaken notion that we can go from silence to brilliance without warming up. And I like saying tongue twisters out loud to get present oriented and to warm up my voice. So that's one that I often recommend. People think it's silly, but I have people who are like, that really works. It really helps me to get centered and to warm up. And so I like that one a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):
Well, let's share a couple of tongue twisters. What are some recommendations?

Matt Abrahams (00:29:50):
I will only share my tongue twister, I say Lenny, if you promise to say it after me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Absolutely. I'm so ready.

Matt Abrahams (00:29:55):
This is my favorite tongue twister. It takes five seconds to say, it's three phrases long. And if you say it wrong, you say a naughty word. So I'm going to be listening as for all your listeners. So are you prepared? So it goes as follows, I slit a sheet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):
I slit a sheet.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:11):
A sheet I slit

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):
A sheet I slit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:14):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:18):
And on that slitted sheet I sit.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:20):
Very good. You didn't say that naughty word. I'm sure you can imagine what it would've been.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
A lot of danger, a lot of [inaudible 00:30:26].

Matt Abrahams (00:30:26):
A lot of danger. But in that moment you weren't thinking about, what's the next question I'm going to ask Matt? Or how much longer do we have in the podcast? No, you were simply focused on what we were saying and trying to say it without saying a naughty word. So that's that [inaudible 00:30:39]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:38):
And not have to censor this podcast.

Matt Abrahams (00:30:42):
I've only had to bleep one guest in all my years of doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:46):
Okay, cool. We're going to link to that. Is there any other ones you want to share before we move on to getting better at speaking on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (00:30:52):
Well, the last one I'll say is, and this one is another one that falls in the kind of funny category, but there's research that says that when you swear, curse, it actually helps you reduce anxiety. When you curse, you release a flood of neurochemicals that blunt out the neurochemicals associated with anxiety, cortisol being a big one. So you get a big dopamine hit, for example, serotonin when you swear. So I'm not saying get up on stage and drop an F-bomb, but my students love this. I mean, it's like, "Matt's giving me permission to swear." And no, that's not what I'm doing, but it's an interesting technique that seems to help some people is to curse not necessarily in front of people, but that can help. And it also has an analgesic effect. It actually reduces pain as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):
That's interesting. I could see during birth women screaming curse words.

Matt Abrahams (00:31:48):
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to say what I heard when my kids were born, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):
But again, this could double up with the tongue twister where you just go for it and say-

Matt Abrahams (00:31:58):
Yeah, every tongue twister has to start with Nantucket and then we're good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):

(00:33:34):
Okay, let's shift to talking about talking on the spot.

Matt Abrahams (00:33:39):
I see you said shift very carefully. I appreciate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):
Now we're going to be so, so careful, I don't want this podcast flagged and for adults only. Okay, shift to a new topic. You have a whole book about how to get better speaking on the spot. And I think why this is important is again, what I said at the beginning that I think most of our "public speaking" is not planned public speaking. There's people asking for feedback in a meeting, people wanting you to give a toast, Q&A as we talked about. So what I want to do is you have advice for broadly getting better at these things and then you have advice for very specifically how to get better at giving better toast, doing better Q&A, getting better at small talk and things like that. So I want to start with the broad advice and then get into each of these. That sound good?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:27):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
How about you share your favorite techniques for broadly getting better at speaking on the spot, and then we'll see where that goes?

Matt Abrahams (00:34:37):
Sure. So the first thing in helping yourself feel better, speaking spontaneously, which is the vast majority of our communication, the plan presenting, the practiced pitch, the meeting with agenda pale in comparison to the times that we are spontaneously speaking. And the first thing that is important for everybody to know is we can all get better at it. That's the fundamental bottom line. Many of us feel like we're either born with the gift of gab or we're not. And so the first thing we have to realize is we can get better at it.

(00:35:08):
The second big point to make is you actually have to prepare to be spontaneous. And that's counterintuitive, but it is through preparation that we get better at it. And if you think about it, if you think about an athlete, when an athlete is doing their sport, they are being spontaneous, they are responding to the conditions that present themselves to them. What helps them do well is all the preparation and practice that they've done. So there are lots of analogs to this, but when we think about it in of communication, it seems foreign, but when you think about it in athletics or jazz music, it's like of course you would prepare and practice. Those are the two big underlying principles to helping people get better.

(00:35:48):
The next level has to do with we have to attack both mindset and approach and the actual messaging itself. The only way I have found to help people get better at this is to look at how we approach it, our mindset, and then how we actually craft the messages through structure and focus that help us be better. So that's the gradual process from the broadest level about how we have to go about making this better for ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:14):
Maybe let's dig into the structure.

Matt Abrahams (00:36:17):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:17):
What is your advice for how to think about structuring if you're on the spot, like, "Oh, shit, how do I share something smart [inaudible 00:36:22]?"

Matt Abrahams (00:36:22):
See, the bad word came out, so you're ready for my tongue twister. So structure is critical. In spontaneous speaking, most of us, because we feel the intense pressure, the anxiety we just talked about, we just spew out information, we list and itemize information. We take our audience on the journey of our own discovery of what we want to say as we're saying it, and our brains are not wired for lists of information. In fact, Lenny, how many items do you need to buy from the grocery store before you actually have to physically write it down? For me it's four. Anything over four, I'm going to forget something. Our brains aren't wired for lists, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
Yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:03):
And so-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:04):
I text myself.

Matt Abrahams (00:37:05):
Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah, no, I'm old school. I actually put it on a piece of paper, but the point is that we're not wired that way. Our brains are actually wired for story, for connection, a logical connection of ideas. So it's about connecting those pieces together. So a structure is nothing more than a beginning, a middle, and an end. A package of information. The structure that almost everybody listening in is familiar with is one that comes from the world of advertising. Most advertisements are set up as problem, solution, benefit. There's some problem in the world, here's how we solve it with our product or service, and here's how you benefit from it. That's a structure. It's a logical beginning, middle, and end. These items have a connection. So by finding a structure that you can rely on when put on the spot, it halves your burden.

(00:37:54):
When you're put on the spot, you have to think about what to say and how to say it. The structure tells you how to say it, and then you just have to think about what to put into it. So it's like having a recipe. If I have a recipe and I have good ingredients, I can cook a good meal. So there are lots of structures.

(00:38:10):
The whole second part of the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is specific structures for specific situations, introducing yourself, making an apology, giving feedback. And I'm not saying every time you give an apology or give feedback that you have to follow these structures. It just gives you a place to go when you're in that moment where you're like, "Where do I go? How do I start?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):
Cool. So we're going to talk about those examples. One of the structures that I liked that I wrote down is called prep, which is make your point, give a reason for making that point, give an example. And then what's the last one point again?

Matt Abrahams (00:38:47):
Yeah, restate your point. Review it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:48):
Restate your point. That feels like something that say in product teams can come up a lot is just like, here's what I think, here's why. Here's an example and then let me just remind you again what the point I'm making.

Matt Abrahams (00:38:57):
That's right. Yes. I love prep and the structure I really like is a three-question structure: What? So what? Now what? And people on product teams I think could benefit so much from this. What is your product, your service, your offering, your update, your feedback? It's the what of why you're speaking. The so what is why is this important and relevant to the people you're talking to or to your company or to prospective clients? And then the now what is what comes next. So on a product team, if you're describing a feature, here's what the feature is, here's why it's important, and here's what we're doing about it. If you're giving an update in an update meeting, a standup that you're having, here's what I'm working on, here's why it's important, here's what I'm doing next.

(00:39:41):
By packaging the information up in what, so what, now what, it becomes much more digestible, much more memorable. Just like prep. Prep works really well for a point you're making. What, so what, now what works really well for a broader presentation, update, feedback session that you're giving. So having a whole series of these tools in your toolkit can really make a difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
So we've talked about three structures so far. What, so what, now what; prep, which is make the point, give a reason example, and then restate the point; and then problem, solution benefit. So people listening to this it's like, "Oh, amazing, all these structures are great." Do you have any advice on how to remember these? You're like, "Oh, Matt, what do you think of this design?" Like, "Oh, shit, which one should I go with?"

Matt Abrahams (00:40:28):
I try to give each structure a catchy name. What, so what, now what rolls off the tongue. There's a structure in the book for giving feedback called 4Is for Apologizing AAA. So part of it is just coming up with a mnemonic that works for you and you can name them whatever you want, but really the way to get familiar with them and to have them at the ready is to use them.

(00:40:48):
When I coach people on what, so what, now what, I encourage them at the end of a podcast they listen to or something they read, take a moment and say, "What was it about? Why is it important to me and what can I do with that information?" And if you do that, not only do you get better and more comfortable deploying that structure, but you also remember the material better because there's a whole bunch of research that says when we interrogate the material that we listen to or read, we digest it and remember it more. So in 30 seconds you're really helping yourself at least in two ways by getting the structure down and remembering more. So you have to put it into practice.

(00:41:24):
The other way to do it in which we do a lot in my classroom is we have people dissect communication. So you listen to somebody or you see it and you say, what structure did they use? So it's about awareness building and then actually getting the reps. The only way you get better at communication, spontaneous or planned, is the way you get better at anything. Repetition, reflection, and feedback. You got to practice, you got to think about what worked or what didn't, and then you have to get feedback from others. We are not always the best judges of our communication. And in so doing, repetition, reflection and feedback takes your communication to the next level.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
That's a lot of work, Matt. That's a lot of work.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:02):
It is work. There is no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:04):
Got you.

Matt Abrahams (00:42:05):
But that's true with most things in life that are really important. There's no shortcut.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
That's right. That's right. As people are thinking about this and listening to this, there's your course, obviously that you teach at Stanford and only Stanford students can take that. There's your book obviously. Is there anything else? If there's nothing, that's totally fine, that you point people to to actually practice these outside of the workplace? Are there courses that anyone can take that you recommend? Anything else you can point people to?

Matt Abrahams (00:42:31):
Absolutely. There are a lot of resources out there. One, I'm a huge proponent and a former member of Toastmasters. I think Toastmasters is a wonderful organization designed primarily to give you the reps. They do some teaching, but it's really to give you the reps. So I highly recommend Toastmasters.

(00:42:48):
Improvisation is another way to get comfortable with these skills. When people hear improv, they think, "Oh, I got to be funny and it's about performing," and it's not. Improv is really just about being more comfortable, being present, and really focusing on collaborating with others.

(00:43:04):
And then there are courses. You mentioned obviously that people have to be MBA students to take my MBA class, but Stanford and other institutions have continuing studies classes or extension classes that are open to the community. So I, every quarter teach a class that's open to anybody who registers all over the world. It's virtual. I have students this very quarter who take a class on a Monday night Pacific Time, 7:00 PM. I've got somebody in Egypt, I have somebody in China. So there are ways to take advantage of things happening at universities without being an enrolled student. So I would point people to all of those. And then clearly listening to podcasts, reading books, checking out blogs and videos can be really helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:44):
I think to your point, it's like you can read about this and listen to podcasts all you want, but you're not going to actually get that much better. And with your course, I imagine there's practice you're doing as a part of the course.

Matt Abrahams (00:43:53):
Everything is applied. The only way to get better at communication is to do communication, to watch communication. And that's why in the books I write, I have this, try this. It's literally put the book down, go do this and then come back because that's how you learn communication. And so yes, any avenue to help you get the reps is going to be helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):
I'll be honest, I did none of the try this. I'm just like, that's too much work. So I think that's why it's important to take something where you have to do it because it's too easy just like, yeah, yeah.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:24):
Yeah. You're not the first person to say that they don't take the time to do that. There are others who say they really appreciate that. And for people such as yourself, at the very end of my book, I have a QR code that takes you to a bunch of videos. So if you don't want to do it yourself, you can actually watch people do it or watch me do it. And so that's at least better than not doing any of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:46):
Awesome. I'll also give a shout-out to Toastmasters. I did Toastmasters for a while and two things there. One is there's a special focus on the spot speaking that's a part of the sequence.

Matt Abrahams (00:44:56):
They call them table topics.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):
Table topics, yeah. And that's like a 60-second, someone gets up and just has to talk on something. So it's a big part of that method. Also, I did it for a long time and all I did was I was the counter or the timer. You can do it without having to give any talks for as long as you want. And it's very cheap and they're everywhere. There's a local chapter wherever you are.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:17):
Absolutely. And many companies sponsor their own Toastmasters groups, so that's great. And they are very good at easing people into it. You're not forced to do anything. And the same is with improv. A good improv teacher never forces anybody to do anything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):
Great. We went way off-topic, but let's get back to the agenda at hand, which is let's talk about specific situations and advice you have for getting better at these. So maybe we start with small talk and there's one that I love and I find so important and so subtle, which is have comparable levels of disclosure. And the question basically is how do we get better at small talk? And here's one technique.

Matt Abrahams (00:45:55):
Yeah, so let me get to that point in a second because that's a more refined point than some general principles. When it comes to small talk, many people dread small talk, they feel really awkward about it. I think small talk has a bad reputation, needs to be rebranded. I think a lot of big things happen in small talk. We learn about ourselves and others. We form and foster relationships. I challenge everybody listening to think about some of their friends, our closest friends. How did you meet them? Probably some component of small talk played a role, especially early in those relationships. So it does good things for us.

(00:46:32):
The best advice I have ever heard for small talk came from a guest on my podcast. Her name's Rachel Greenwald. She's an interesting person. She's an academic and a matchmaker, really fascinating. And her advice was this: Be interested, not interesting. Many of us go into small talk thinking we have to be super interesting. We have to spike the ball over the net every time. When in fact small talk is more like playing the game of Hacky Sack, where it's simply just set the other person up to be successful and get the ball back to you. So if we go in with that mindset, it makes it easier.

(00:47:06):
Now there's some rules that we can follow. One rule is the one that you shared that in small talk there should be a balance of disclosure or depth of disclosure over time. So if you're telling me about the first time your first pet died, and I'm telling you my favorite color is blue, there's a discrepancy in disclosure there. Clearly you've revealed a lot more than I have. And we have this notion of reciprocity that if you share something that is appropriate but is more disclosive, that I should at some point match that level or come close. And if we don't, then it feels very awkward and we feel like we're not jiving in that way.

(00:47:49):
I don't want everybody sitting with a little card that they're checking off, but having that general notion in mind can help. And the trick here is not to be too disclosive too quickly. So if we start small talk and we're talking about the I meeting that we're at, and you immediately jump into the fight you had with your significant other that might lead to divorce, that's a deep and big step that might feel a little inappropriate. But over time, if we continue to disclose, it might be perfectly natural for you to share that. So there's sort of expectations and we just have to be mindful of those.

(00:48:24):
Another thing we need to be mindful of that I think is really important is this distinction between shifting and supporting responses. In a conversation, I can be supportive. That is, you might say, "Hey Matt, I just got back from Costa Rica." I could say, "Oh great, did you spend time in San Jose? Did you get to any of the beaches?" Those are supporting responses. I'm asking you to keep telling me more. A shifting response would be like, "Oh, you went to Costa Rica. I went to Hawaii." And the goal in a good conversation is to have more supporting responses than shifting, but to have some shifting responses. Because if all I do is continually support you, it looks like I don't want to share. I'm not being disclosive at all. So there are these subtle things that we can be aware of to help the conversation go and to breed that intimacy and immediacy that we feel, but it takes a congruence, a balancing of doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):
This is awesome. I feel like everyone needs this class to just like, how do I talk to people? What's the right way to talk?

Matt Abrahams (00:49:24):
Well, right. The point that you're bringing up there, Lenny, is we're never taught this stuff and yet we have to do it all the time. And that's why focusing on it I think really matters. And it can really, as you said, superpower, it can be a superpower because so many people don't do this or spend the time getting better at it. We all operate under this notion of... the definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again, expecting different results. And that's not good for small talk and other communication situations.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:53):
I love this balance you just shared of... So the primary piece of advice for small talk is be interested, not interesting, ask person questions, get excited about what they're telling you. There's a classic book, How to Win Friends and Influence People, which is very much about this. Highly recommend it. It's like very old school now, but there's so much good advice there. There's no better sound to someone's ears than their name. So just saying their name, they're like, "Yeah, I love that." And then just smiling. There's all these very simple things that that book shares. It sounds like you recommend and you're fan of that book, and it's something you've read, right?

Matt Abrahams (00:50:27):
I know the book. Some of that stuff has been true for a long time. Some of the stuff. I'm not a big fan of ingratiation and manipulation. I like authenticity and some of the advice in books like that can sound like smile, nod your head. And all of that can sound a little manipulative and inauthentic, but I think some of those principles are important. And if you can in an authentic, true, appropriate way, leverage some of that, I think it would help you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:57):
Yeah, somebody once shared a story with their kid... Then they're 13. They read that book and it just effed them up for a while because they just started putting these into practice way too young.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:06):
Well, one thing... I mean, all of a sudden you're focusing on... You can get so wrapped up in doing these things that you're actually not connecting. It's like people who travel on a vacation and all they do is take pictures of where they are instead of experiencing where they are. And that's not where we want to be with this advice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:23):
But I love this other component of... Because a lot of people hear this advice, ask questions, be interested, be excited, this version of it, but you need to have somewhat equal levels of disclosure is really important. Because I fall into this sometimes where like, "I don't care about myself. I just want to ask you questions. And this is going great, I'm just going to keep asking." And if you're not sharing anything by yourself, it gets really strange. Even when they ask you, you're like, "No, no, let's keep talking about you." You think they want that, but they don't. They actually want to hear about you.

Matt Abrahams (00:51:50):
Yeah, absolutely. And you do such a lovely job as a podcast... I mean, so podcast host is a great job for you if you like asking questions, but I bet you have found, because I have found this for me as being a host of Think Fast, Talk Smart is that sharing a little bit about your own experience actually makes the conversations go better. And so I think that's a lesson for all of us, and you don't have to have your own podcast to learn that lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:16):
Yeah, I read this book on podcasting interviewing when I first started, and one of the big piece of advice is if you share more about yourself, you'll hear more stories that they can share. They're more vulnerable. Not that I think about that, but that's in my head sometimes.

Matt Abrahams (00:52:29):
Yeah. Well, you do a good job of it, even if it's just intuitive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Appreciate it.

(00:52:33):
Let's talk about another version of on-the-spot talking, which is giving feedback. Oftentimes people listening to this podcast, they're asked, what do you think of this design? What do you think of this roadmap? What do you think of the strategy? What are some tips for getting better at on-the-spot feedback?

Matt Abrahams (00:52:48):
First and foremost, we need to look at and define feedback. Feedback to me is an opportunity to problem solve. Certainly there are some behaviors that we absolutely have to shut down. It's inappropriate, it's inexcusable, we have to shut it down. But often feedback is really an opportunity to problem solve. And if you take it as an opportunity to problem solve, then what you're looking for is collaboration with the other person, which means that we have to invite them to join us as we do this. So it's not me bestowing upon you my opinion, it's me inviting you to together work on whatever this issue challenge is that we have. And I am a huge disciple of Kim Scott, Radical Candor. I really like her approach to it. Kim's a friend. She's actually a neighbor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):
Well, she's been on the podcast, by the way.

Matt Abrahams (00:53:35):
Oh, great. So you know Kim and your listeners know Kim. Yeah, she's great. Where I think I can add a little value to what Kim talks about, and she does talk about structure, but I think having the structure to package up the information to make it easier to digest by your audience, the person or people you're talking to, but also to formulate your thoughts can help. And we've already talked about one mechanism, one structure for feedback. It's what, so what, now what?

(00:53:59):
So imagine, Lenny, you and I come out of a meeting and you say, "Hey, Matt, how'd that go?" I could say, "I thought the meeting went really well, Lenny, except when you talked about the implementation plan. You spoke a little quicker than you did with the other parts and you didn't go into the same level of detail." That's my what. "When you speak quickly without a lot of detail, people might think you're not as prepared or you're really concerned about this part." That's the so what. "Next time I suggest you slow down and you include these two or three bits of data so that people see you really are knowledgeable on this area." So that's the now what.

(00:54:32):
So that what, so what, now what helps me very quickly structure information and package it in a way that helps me as the giver of the feedback, think through what are the things I need to say? I need to think through what's bothering me, what the consequences are of that behavior, and then what I think you should do.

(00:54:51):
There's a more robust structure I talk about in the book called The 4 Is, and each I stands for something starting with the letter I. But four eyes also like glasses. It helps you see more clearly. So in the 4 I structure, the first I is information. You're just setting the playing field so the person knows what you're giving the feedback about. The second is impact, and this is impact on you, the feedback giver. The third is the invitation that you make, and then the final is the implications or consequences.

(00:55:19):
So imagine I have an employee who doesn't show up to the meetings on time and prepared. I might say, "This is the third time that you have showed up late to this meeting. I feel you're not prioritizing this meeting the same way others of us are. What can we do to help make sure you show up prepared for the next meeting? Because if you do, we're going to finish the project on time and get a new cool project." So information, impact, invitation, and implications. Now, certainly I can vary the tone and the directness of some of those responses so it sounds very differently, but thinking through it in my mind, I have to level set what we're talking about. I have to share why it's important to me at least, make the invitation, and talk about the benefits or consequences. Makes a lot of sense. So there are lots of structures and lots of ways to communicate, especially in feedback. Find one or two that work for you so when you're put on the spot, you can default to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):
Maybe a big takeaway here is pick one of these structures that you want to use when somebody asks you for feedback. And the two you shared are what? So what? Now what? Or these four Is. Give information, show the impact that it had on you, invitation and then implications.

Matt Abrahams (00:56:30):
That's correct, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Okay. Let's talk about another category, which is not a work category, but I suck at toasts and I am always trying to get better at this. And you have a bunch of awesome advice for how to give better toasts. Can you share some stuff?

Matt Abrahams (00:56:45):
Yeah. We have all been victimized by bad toasts. The toast that goes on too long, the toast that's more about the person giving the toast than the event or the person. And when I say toast, I don't just mean at weddings, bar mitzvahs, quinceaneras. We give tributes at work all the time. Congratulations to the team or somebody's anniversary or somebody's retirement. So we give toasts and tributes all the time. In fact, I heard a statistic once that it is the most frequent public speaking event across people is giving toasts and tributes. So we should learn how to do these well.

(00:57:16):
So I have an acronym. It works. It's called WHAT. W-H-A-T. The W stands for why are we here? Now, if I'm at a wedding, I don't have to tell the audience why we're here. We get it. But if we're doing an all hands and I'm called up to speak, it might be in my best interest to share with everybody, I'm here to celebrate the release of this product that that team put out. So you might have to say, why are we here?

(00:57:42):
The H is how are you connected to the event? So if I'm at a wedding, people might not know who I am. I could say, "Hey, I've known the groom for 25 years." And people are like, "Oh, okay. Now that makes sense." If you're giving a tribute at work, you don't have to say, "And I'm the boss." Everybody knows your position. So again, these are choices you make. So why are we here? How are you connected?

(00:58:02):
The A stands for anecdote. Tell a story or a quick example that is relevant and accessible to everybody. There's no insider knowledge and keep it concise.

(00:58:16):
And then ultimately the last part is the gratitude, the thank you. So express gratitude, express some kind of thanks. In a toast at a celebratory event, you might say cheers or whatever's appropriate for the culture you come from to signal closure. But again, why are we here? How are you connected? Anecdote or two, and then the gratitude or thanking at the end. And if you follow that structure, it can navigate, just like a GPS, your way through the toast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):
This is such an easy structure to remember. There's so much of it that I love. What I want to understand is where do you put the actual content of the tribute and the toast? Is it the anecdote expands into, "Here's what I want to say?" Like there's an example or story and then it's like-

Matt Abrahams (00:58:59):
Exactly. So it is typically part of that. You might do it as part of the why we're all here. "We're here to really celebrate the Herculean effort of this particular team to get this product launched. I'm so honored to have supported it. I'm the manager of the team. Here's a story about how Lenny worked overtime to get this done. Let's raise our glasses and give them a salute." So yes, you could do it in the why are we here or through the anecdotes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:29):
Okay. And then one of your other piece of advice, which connects to what you just said is be brief.

Matt Abrahams (00:59:33):
Yes, yes. So nobody has ever complained about a toast that's too brief. I'm sure it's possible, but the majority of complaints are the toast went on forever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):
Do you find that it would ever make sense to give a couple anecdotes or make a couple points in a toast?

Matt Abrahams (00:59:51):
Yeah, and it depends. Toasts are opportunities for teaching and learning as well, especially in a work environment. So it might make sense to tell a couple anecdotes. I'm a huge fan... I mean, your listeners know, you know minimally viable product design, agile development, really critical. What is it about? It's about understanding your audience, your users, and it's about rapidly prototyping and iterating. I believe in minimally viable communication, trademark pending, where it's the same principles. Know your audience, put together a rough draft of what you want to say, test it out. So if you're going to give a big toast in front of a company all hands, run it by a few people and say, "Is it too many anecdotes? Would it benefit from having another story?" Get people's feedback. We are not the best judges of our communication. So the answer is yes, but test it out.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
Another element of a great toast that you recommend is to be emotional. Can you touch on that?

Matt Abrahams (01:00:50):
Well, so emotion connects with people, and as long as it's genuine and authentic, it's really important. I've been thinking a lot about emotion and communication. My father recently passed away and everybody in my family said, "Well, Matt's going to do the eulogy." It was like, I had no choice. What do I do? I'm the guy who teaches communication. So I felt added pressure not only to honor my father's life, but everybody's like, "This is the way you do a eulogy." And so I wanted to do some research on what's all the advice out there on eulogies, and there wasn't a lot. So I actually wrote an article on my experience, and hopefully it'll help people. But the point is, in those circumstances where there's a lot of emotion, it's important because it connects to the audience, it makes it human, but sometimes the emotion can get in the way for you as a communicator. I mean, I was very concerned that my emotion would cover up or overshadow the honoring I was trying to do of my father. But the same thing can happen in any kind of toast situation.

(01:01:48):
So think about emotion. Emotion is a tool to use. The best way to convey emotion in a toast is through the anecdotes you use. The anecdotes reveal the emotion. It's one thing to say, "I am so sad." It's another thing to tell a story that is sad.

(01:02:02):
I was very fortunate to interview for my podcast coming up soon, a one-panel cartoonist. So she has to create everything in one panel. And her advice is: Don't tell, show. In that don't tell somebody you're angry, show that you're angry in the panel she writes. So showing the emotion through story and anecdote is the way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:22):
Have you had Matthew Dix on your podcast?

Matt Abrahams (01:02:26):
So it is so funny. I have not, and I want to. His name comes up more than anybody else's. And I know of his work and his advice, so I might ask you to connect me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):
Absolutely. I thought of him as you were talking because he helps people create their eulogy ahead of time before somebody passes away, before you get really emotional and you have to rush it. So that's one of his services is he helps to write eulogies for people.

Matt Abrahams (01:02:50):
Yeah, yeah. No, I'd love an introduction. His work is very influential.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Absolutely. He's amazing. We'll link his episode about storytelling.

(01:02:57):
Okay, let me talk about a couple more. Q&A, getting better at question, answer at the end of a talk, whether it's on the spot or not.

Matt Abrahams (01:03:05):
Again, I always start with approach. Many of us see Q&A as threatening or challenging, and in fact, we need to see Q&A as an opportunity. It's an opportunity to extend, expand, connect, learn. Even in the most hostile of situations where people are really coming at you with a lot of spice or hot and heavy, you can get a lot of value out of it. So we have to come to the approaches. These questions are opportunities. We have to make sure that we take the question in without interrupting or over-validating the question.

(01:03:36):
I have two pet peeves about Q&A sessions. One is saying good question to every question. And two, at the end of answering the question saying, "Does that make sense?" Because in both cases, you're trying to validate the asker when you say good question. You're also trying to buy yourself time. And there are other ways to do that. And at the end when you say, "Does that make sense," you've got a laudable goal in mind, which is, "Did I answer your question?" But I'd much rather you say, "Did I answer your question? Can I tell you more? Do you have a follow-up question?"" Because if you keep saying, "does that make sense, does that make sense," people are going to start thinking, "Maybe he doesn't make sense because he is always asking." So some pet peeves there.

(01:04:15):
Once the question comes in and you have to answer it, I have yet another structure. This structure is related to the what, so what, now what structure. It's called ADD for adding value. You answer the question cleanly and concisely. You then give an example to reinforce the answer, and then you explain the relevance or significance of the answer so people know it. Would you mind role-playing an example of this with me, Lenny?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):
Absolutely.

Matt Abrahams (01:04:44):
Okay. Imagine you're hiring me. You're a hiring manager, and I'm interviewing to be what I do for my day job. I'm a lecturer at Stanford's Business School, teach strategic communication. You so happen to have a position open for a strategic communication lecturer. I show up. What is a reasonable question you would ask that doesn't just have a yes no answer?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:07):
Wait, so you're interviewing for a role to be a lecturer in my school and [inaudible 01:05:11] communication.

Matt Abrahams (01:05:11):
Yes. You're the dean. You get to hire me. What's a reasonable question? I mean, you could ask a super hard one, but I want people to hear how ADD works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:19):
This might be too simple, but just how many students have you worked with and taught over the years?

Matt Abrahams (01:05:23):
Okay, so I'm going to morph that question because I could just say thousands, which is true, but I'm going to turn it into a question about experience, because really what you're asking me is what's my experience? So because that I can give an ADD answer too. If it's just a numeric answer, just give a number. So I might say, "I've been doing this for 25 years and I have taught over thousands of students. I've taught both in the academic world, but also in the corporate world. What this means is I can tailor my material to be relevant and useful to your students."

(01:05:56):
So I answered the question. The question was, what's your experience? 25 years, thousands of students. I then give an example. I've done this in the corporate world, I've done this in the academic world. So I ground it in something tangible. And then I show the relevance. What this means for you as a dean hiring me, is that I'm going to be able to tailor my experience. We often assume that people can connect the dots. If I give my answer, you're going to see, "Oh, that's why this is relevant and important." But we need to actually connect those dots for our audience.

(01:06:24):
I had a psychology professor once who said, the funny thing about common sense is it's not so common, and we often make the assumption that people will connect the dots. So answer the question, give a detailed example, and then explain the relevance. And if you do that, it will help. And I challenge every one of your listeners working in companies that have FAQs, frequently asked questions, go back to those FAQs and put them in this structure. Not only will it help you digest and get familiar and comfortable with the structure, anybody looking at those answers begins to see that this is a way to give a complete answer. This is how our organization answers questions. And that can be so helpful to building consistency and helping yourself answer better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):
Just to clarify, the acronym is ADD?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:09):
ADD. Answer, detailed example, describe the relevance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):
Describe the relevance. I see how you snuck that D in there.

Matt Abrahams (01:07:16):
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you can come up with whatever acronym you want that helps you remember. ADD because it adds value.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:24):
Awesome. Okay. And maybe one last quick one, apologizing. What's a couple tips for getting better at apologizing on the spot?

Matt Abrahams (01:07:33):
First and foremost, we need to take the time to apologize. Many of us don't. And when we apologize, we need to make sure that we apologize for the transgression and not for how we made people feel. So often people will simply say, "I'm sorry that you feel bad." Well, that's not an apology. You're not assuming responsibility. So we need to first start by talking about the issue that we are addressing or the problem that we caused somebody. So we need to think about apologies in that way. So an apology to me, I have a AAA, like roadside repair service here in the United States, AAA. It's three steps, acknowledge, appreciate, and amends. So I have to acknowledge what I did.

(01:08:23):
So imagine we're in a meeting and I interrupted you. You were in the midst of speaking and I interrupted you. So I might say, "I'm very sorry for interrupting what you were saying. I over-spoke when you were talking." I'm acknowledging what I did.

(01:08:36):
Then I appreciate. "I can imagine my doing that made you feel bad and you feel that you didn't get your fair share of sharing your point of view." So that's the appreciation.

(01:08:46):
The amends part is, "I will work not to do this. In fact, I will wait till you're done, and I will actually paraphrase what you said before I contribute my point." So I'm signaling I understand it, and here's the very specific thing I'm going to do to try to remedy it, which of course you can comment on. You can say, no, I don't think that's enough. I think you whatever, or thank you, I think that's even more than is needed, whatever. So you acknowledge the actual behavior and offense, not how you made the person feel right away. You then express appreciation for the difficulty you might've caused, and then you make amends. And the AAA approach, I think can really be helpful to people to be better at in-the-moment apologies.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):
Amazing. Matt, I think we've packed this episode with so many tactical golden nuggets to help people become better communicators, especially on the spot. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before I ask you how they can find you online and things like that?

Matt Abrahams (01:09:45):
Again, I want to go back to how we started the second part about spontaneous speaking. Everybody can get better at communication. And I encourage, I challenge people to take the steps that they need to take to do it. So it starts with initiative. It's followed by grace and a lot of compassion, it takes time. But in so doing, you can improve your communication and help others. It's not just about you finding your voice, it's about you sharing that voice with others. So taking the time to work on your communication is critically important, and I encourage everybody to do so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:18):
All right. I'm hoping people will follow that advice. And if not, think back to what we talked about at the beginning of just how much impact these have and how many people are also going through the same challenges you're probably feeling speaking and being on the spot. All right, where can folks find your podcast, your book, and also how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Abrahams (01:10:37):
Oh, I love that last question. So mattabrahams.com, great place to go to to find things. So at mattabrahams.com you'll find a whole bunch of resources. My own and others. I've curated a bunch of resources. You can find Think Fast, Talk Smart wherever you get podcasts and on YouTube. And then the book Think Faster, Talk Smarter is available everywhere. I'm a huge user of LinkedIn. And to answer that last question you asked, I invite people to connect on LinkedIn. I'd love to hear their stories and find ways to collaborate.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
Awesome. And your podcast is ranked higher than this podcast. You're in a different category, which is a very competitive category. The business category. I've moved myself to the technology category, which feels more natural to me, but your podcast is killing it, so congrats.

Matt Abrahams (01:11:06):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:21):
Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us. That's it. Matt, thank you again for being here.

## Transcript

Matt LeMay (00:00:00):
More product managers and teams are getting laid off. The problem is the message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024, we still have too many teams doing work around the work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
Even if you are told to build the thing that the execs are really excited about, you're still going to get fired eventually.

Matt LeMay (00:00:15):
If you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team? Frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):
Which is something you call the low impact PM Death Spiral.

Matt LeMay (00:00:26):
Is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in, one way or another.

(00:00:33):
It starts with adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements until the next round of layoffs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
You have three steps to become more of an impact first product team.

Matt LeMay (00:00:42):
So the first is in setting team goals, no more than one step away from company goals. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):
You're an ICPM. It's up to you. No excuses.

Matt LeMay (00:00:52):
You can follow all the best practices, but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0. 6 or a 0.7.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Matt Lameé. Matt is a longtime product leader, author of one of the most popular and practical books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

(00:01:12):
Over the course of his consulting practice, he's worked with hundreds of product teams, helping them improve how they operate and drive more impact, more consistently.

(00:01:20):
From that experience, he wrote and recently published a new book called Impact First Product Teams, that I could not agree more with.

(00:01:26):
In our conversation, Matt shares why it is so essential to align all of your work with business critical outcomes, especially if you fear layoffs at your company.

(00:01:35):
We talk about the low impact death spiral that many product teams fall into. What steps an individual product team can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organization approaches product development. Tips for how to push back on stupid ideas that execs ask you to build, and so much more.

(00:01:52):
The message in this episode is one that I believe every product manager needs to hear, especially if you don't work at a high-flying Silicon Valley tech company.

(00:02:00):
A huge thank you to Martin Erickson, Adrian Joselow, and Dan Corbin for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

Matt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Matt LeMay (00:04:29):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm really, really excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):
I'm even more excited. You have a really interesting background. I usually don't spend time on background, but I thought this would be fun.

(00:04:38):
I was looking at your LinkedIn and your background. The beginning of your career you spent 13 years at Pitchfork reviewing music.

Matt LeMay (00:04:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):
Reviewing artists. Pitchfork was a massive deal. I don't know where it is today, but it was the most influential music review site. Is it still a big deal or is it less so?

Matt LeMay (00:04:55):
It is still a big deal. It was much less of a big deal when I started working for them and I was a 16-year-old music nerd, writing record reviews in my bedroom at my parents' apartment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
Okay, so what I'm hearing is you helped make them a big deal. Excellent. That's impacts. We're going to talk all about impact.

Matt LeMay (00:05:11):
If I were better at telling my own story, that's exactly what I'd be saying, is that before I started, I was product manager number one at Pitchfork.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:17):
Funny enough, you look at your resume, you went into product management from Pitchfork. Very typical career path.

(00:05:23):
By the way, if you're on YouTube watching, there's a lot of musical paraphernalia behind you, an awesome guitar, so clearly there's a thread of music throughout your background.

Matt LeMay (00:05:31):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):
Let me ask you this question: what is most similar about making music, and even critiquing music, and building great product?

Matt LeMay (00:05:39):
The magic lies in the way people work together. That's really what I think has been the consistent thread between all the work that I've done.

(00:05:47):
I spent years as a touring musician. I still occasionally tour in my friend Will Chef's band. And it's that magic of people with different perspectives, different ideas, building into something that is somehow greater than the sum of its individual parts and perspectives.

(00:06:03):
That's what makes this interesting. That's what makes music magical. That's what makes product development interesting, especially in the age of AI.

(00:06:13):
When people have the opportunity to, I think, close themselves off from the messier parts of human interaction, from those moments where you realize that your perspective might be limited, that somebody else might be able to expose you to something, show you a way of working, show you a way of seeing that you haven't seen before, I think that those interactions, that ability to learn from and build with each other, is only going to become more valuable and more precious, frankly, as technology continues to do what technology does.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:44):
Wow, what a beautiful answer.

Matt LeMay (00:06:45):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:47):
I love that. So let's get to the task at hand.

Matt LeMay (00:06:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):
So you're known for writing one of the most popular books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.

Matt LeMay (00:06:58):
I suppose I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:59):
Yes. Basically describes the job of a product manager very practically, very specifically, better than any other book out there.

(00:07:09):
You have a new book out called Impact First Product Teams. I asked you what the goal of this book was and you said the goal was what are the steps that individual product teams can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organizations approach product development?

(00:07:25):
And I thought this was a really nice way of framing this conversation. There's two important parts to the sentence that you gave me.

(00:07:32):
One is aligning your work to business critical outcomes, and the other is steps an individual product team can take, regardless of other business functions.

(00:07:40):
So let me start with this first part. This is kind of you named your book after this concept of impact, first: Why is aligning work to impact and to business critical outcomes so important?

Matt LeMay (00:07:51):
It's important because at the end of the day, it is those business critical outcomes against which you and your team will be evaluated. That's the reality of working for a business, right?

(00:08:02):
If you are contributing to the business in a way that the business at large can understand, that the CEO can understand, that the CFO can understand, if your team is a good investment for the business, then the business will continue making that investment.

(00:08:16):
If your team is not a good investment for the business or you don't really know if your team is a good investment for the business, but you figure you're showing up, so probably it's fine, you guess, then that puts you in a really tenuous position, and a position that I think we've all seen not work out terribly well for everybody in recent history.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):
And so, what is this a reaction to? Because I imagine many people hearing this are, like, "Of course, PMs, product teams we're driving business impact, well, that's why we're here."

(00:08:44):
That's not actually the case in most cases. So first of all, just what is this reaction to? Is this the reaction to people being, like, "Oh, we're just going to build great products, we're going to listen to customers,"? Talk about the flip side of this.

Matt LeMay (00:08:55):
I mean, there's a couple of things. I think the main one is just more product managers and teams are getting laid off. That's a really scary reality right now.

(00:09:05):
And if you look at the messages that are being conveyed by CEOs when they lay off these teams, some of them are pretty clear.

(00:09:13):
The message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024 said, "We still have too many teams doing work around the work and supporting work, rather than focusing on opportunities with real impact."

(00:09:25):
And that really struck a nerve because I've been on those supporting teams before. I've done the work around the work. And I've assumed that if I was given work around the work to do, that surely it must be critical to the business, otherwise they wouldn't have hired me to do it.

(00:09:40):
I don't think that is a safe assumption to make. I think especially given that we are no longer in a zero interest rate environment, given that hiring and retaining employees is expensive, given that companies are looking at cost savings, I think we are in a moment where it is really incumbent upon each product team and each member of each product team to be able to understand, articulate, and work towards the top line business impact of their own work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Awesome. So where this comes from is, one, if you are not driving something that is directly driving business growth, you're not as valuable to the company. You're the kind of person that they'd lay off.

Matt LeMay (00:10:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):
There's also a flip side of finding a job. It feels like if you have shown impact in your resume, "Here's all the impact I've driven," this also helps you get hired. True?

Matt LeMay (00:10:31):
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's the most common resume advice I see, is show the number, show the impact, say what you did.

(00:10:40):
I have a friend who does resume coaching, and I showed her my resume a couple of years ago. And she said, "I love your resume except for one thing. Why do you write like a little girl? Say what you did, say what your contributions were. Don't say 'I helped. I may have maybe helped people do this'. Say the impact. Put the number on it." And I think I needed to hear that from her because I think there is a tendency, especially for those of us who do really thrive in that collaborative environment, who our nature is to not want to take credit for work that could only exist via the contributions of many people with diverse experiences and perspectives.

(00:11:22):
It's really hard to say, "Well, I did this and I contributed to that," but that's part of why I wrote this book at the team level, because I think for folks, like myself, who really enjoy and thrive in that team environment, if you can look at the product team as the foundational unit of impact and say, "We delivered this. We were able to work together to have this impact for the business," that feels really good and also speaks directly to the work that that team did together.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):
That's a really interesting insight. I think a lot of this comes from just PMs naturally are trained to deflect credit and to include, say 'we' in everything and just this person did that. So I get where that comes from. So most listeners will probably still be thinking, "Yes, I'm driving impact, I'm great. I don't have a problem here. I don't to change, need to change anything." What are some ways to stress test your thinking? Maybe some questions to ask yourself or maybe your team of just, like, "Okay, maybe I'm not?"

Matt LeMay (00:12:17):
So the first question I ask most of the teams I work with is if you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team?

(00:12:29):
And that is a small question that can provoke some big reactions. Because, for me, when I was working as a product manager, I truly believed that my job was to find the next most defensible thing to build, build it, celebrate it, find the next most defensible thing to build, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat forever and ever.

(00:12:53):
I kind of assumed that the existence of my team was this righteous fact of the universe, right? My team would always be there for all time, and it was just a matter of us finding the next thing to work on, which meant doing discovery and making concessions to what leadership wanted and doing all that stakeholder management.

(00:13:13):
But the idea that my team came at a cost to the business, that at some point somebody might look at my team on a spreadsheet and say, "Who are these very expensive people? Why do we need them? Do we actually need them?" It just wasn't something that crossed my mind because I wasn't in the room for those conversations. That wasn't how I was thinking about my team's work.

(00:13:34):
So I like asking this question because it's a perspective shift. It gets you thinking if you were personally accountable for the existential market-level success of this business, would you invest in your team?

(00:13:52):
And frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away. They're not sure. They say, "I think so," or, "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because... " And then you can see the gears turning.

(00:14:05):
And again, to me that is a risky situation to be in because if you can't answer that question as a member of the team, nobody else in the organization is going to be as well-equipped to answer that question as you are.

(00:14:19):
So bringing that question to the team, asking it and answering it proactively and collaboratively and being ready to say, "Okay, if we can't answer this confidently, what are the changes we need to make? Do we need to change our purview? Do we need to change our goals? Who do we need to talk to? What do we need to do in order to make this happen, in order to answer that question confidently?" We are much better off having that conversation at the team level than waiting for someone else to have it for us, or at us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
So is kind of the signal here is if you can't confidently say yes, asking yourself this question or your team talking through this and having a clear answer, there's maybe a potential problem that you need to work on?

Matt LeMay (00:15:01):
Absolutely. I think that's exactly it, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:04):
And we'll talk about what to actually do and the steps you recommend to fix this problem, but I want to keep talking about impact because sometimes it takes a while for people to be convinced, "Okay, I need to really do this," versus, "Okay, here's the ways to do this."

Matt LeMay (00:15:15):
Yeah. It has taken me until now, until writing this book to be convinced, and I still feel like I need to be convinced a little bit sometimes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):
I think the layoffs are a really good convincing function for people.

Matt LeMay (00:15:26):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):
Where they're seeing all these PMs being laid off and just, like, "How do I avoid that?" And this is basically the answer to that, is here's how you avoid getting laid off.

(00:15:33):
There's an interesting implication in what you describe here where you encourage the PM and the product team to think like the CEO.

(00:15:39):
This touches on something I've been meaning to write about, but I haven't, which is a lot of people, there's this argument are PMs the mini CEO?

(00:15:46):
In my mind, the PM is 100% the mini CEO, in terms of they think like the CE or they should within the team. They're the same; their job is to think about the business like a CEO within the team.

(00:16:03):
Obviously they're not in charge of everyone. They can't let get anyone go. The reporting lines are not the same. But I feel like that's a really good lens for the job of a PM, is just you're like the mini CEO on a team, making sure you're building the right things, thinking about the business, solving real problems that matter.

Matt LeMay (00:16:19):
I think the way I've come to think about it is that the product manager is responsible for the whole team thinking like a CEO, if that makes sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:26):
I love that.

Matt LeMay (00:16:27):
So if the product manager takes that on as their sole responsibility and says, "I'm the mini CEO. I think about the business," that's a missed opportunity.

(00:16:35):
In my consulting work, it's more often than not been an engineer who's actually able to get to that specific impact-level goal for the team, sometimes before the product manager does, because the engineer is thinking in systems, is thinking about, "Okay, I know this system, I know this other system. I've had this conversation with this person. I think I see how this can all fit together."

(00:16:55):
Sometimes it's a designer or a UX researcher who understands what customers need and who has that direct firsthand knowledge.

(00:17:02):
So I think the way that I certainly initially misinterpreted the mini CEO thing was you are solely in charge of this, as opposed to you are the person who brings that kind of CEO-level commercial thinking to the team. And I've been much more inclined of late to see the product manager's job as to bring in and facilitate that conversation, rather than to be the sole owner of that conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):
That is a really good Nuance to what I said, and it makes all the sense in the world.

(00:17:34):
Following these lines of what is the job for product manager, you have a really nice way of just thinking about it. What does a business expect from a product manager?

Matt LeMay (00:17:42):
Yeah. My favorite definition of product management comes from Melissa Perry's book Escaping the Build Trap, where she describes product management as facilitating a value exchange.You're facilitating a value exchange between a business and its customers.

(00:17:57):
The actual shape and nature of that value exchange depends on so many things. It depends on your funding model, it depends on your business model, it depends on whether you're B2B or B2C, it depends on whether you're publicly traded or privately held. There are so many different variables that go into what a business expects from product teams.

(00:18:19):
And one thing I've come to is that I'm probably too hesitant to generalize in general, aside from that generalization I just made, but I think that the best product managers and teams I've worked with are really curious to understand what success means to their particular business.

(00:18:38):
So if that's a startup, how much runway do we have? What do we need to raise that next round? Are our investors looking for growth? Are they looking for profitability? What are they looking for in order for us to reach that next existential milestone?

(00:18:52):
If we're a publicly traded company, what are investors looking for? What have we told shareholders? What's in our next prospectus? What are we saying we're going to deliver to the market at large?

(00:19:01):
This information usually exists somewhere, but it's really easy to get disconnected from it as we go about the day-to-day work of doing product management.

(00:19:11):
I've been in a lot of rooms having workshops and sessions with teams I work with, where they're pulling up the last town hall meeting to look for slides from their CEO because they're so busy, they have so many day-to-day things to deal with, that for them that town hall day is, like, "Okay, finally I can just not have to deal with people emailing me every 10 seconds." It's a chance to take a deep breath and then get back to the stuff that really matters.

(00:19:38):
But those top-level things, those promises that have been made to the market at large, to the board, to the shareholders, those are often a great place to start for understanding what exactly your business is looking for, so you can figure out how your team's work helps contribute to success in the terms that matter most to the business.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):
That's an amazing segue to exactly where I'd wanted to go, which is this quote that is exactly what you just said, the question you should be asking, it's kind of a different version of the one you shared earlier, which is what are we doing to contribute to the success of the business?

Matt LeMay (00:20:14):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):
So what is it that you think people are thinking instead most often?

Matt LeMay (00:20:21):
It's interesting. We live in a world where for the last 20 years of product development, we've been all about best practices. We love best practices.

(00:20:30):
And I love best practices too. I think best practices can be really valuable, can be really useful. I love how much knowledge sharing there is out there. When I started 15 years ago, it was so much harder to get any sense of how anybody was doing anything.

(00:20:44):
But I think the downside of this is that there are a lot of folks who are really, really fixated on doing things the right way. And a lot of the writing and thinking about doing things the right way exists in kind of this middle layer, between impact and day-to-day work.

(00:21:03):
So if you have impact, the overall success of the business, revenue, growth, profits. Then from there you set objectives and you do initiatives, and then you do bets, and then you make a strategy, and then you do your day-to-day work.

(00:21:15):
I think the tendency among a lot of product teams is to key to those middle pieces, to say, "Okay, what we're doing is on strategy. What we're doing is part of objectives. We did OKRs, right? We spent three weeks coming up with our OKRs for three months. It's OKR season, everybody. We have to pretend to care about our goals, and I read a book that says we have to have five to seven objectives with five to seven key results, and we want the score of each one to be a 0.6 or a 0.7."

(00:21:41):
And at the end of the day, you've actually spent so much time and energy being really clever and cascading these things into these intermediate steps, that each step has incurred more and more risk that we might not achieve that impact we seek to drive.

(00:21:59):
Each time we abstract things out, each time we cascade things from impact to something else until we wind up with a checklist of features to build, we're assuming that if we then build that checklist of features... We will have a successful business.

(00:22:14):
But honestly, most of the companies and teams I work with, if I ask them how their lowest-level goals add up to their highest-level goals, they look at me like I just asked them the most impossible question in the world.

(00:22:27):
Because by the time you get things down to that level, maybe it's going to work, maybe it's not going to work. There are assumptions baked into each of those levels.

(00:22:37):
You might go through the motions of doing OKRs the right way or doing strategy the right way, but that doesn't guarantee that your strategy is going to work. It doesn't mean that your OKRs are going to add up to what your investors or your shareholders need to see.

(00:22:52):
So I think there's a tendency among product teams to really sweat the middle, and to get really stressed out if the middle is not in perfect theoretical harmony with itself. If the objectives are a little out of line with the initiatives, are a little out of line with the bets, are a little out of line with the domains.

(00:23:14):
But at the end of the day, I don't think I've ever worked for a company where these things add up to a perfect breadcrumb trail you can trace back from, "We prioritized these bits of work in this sprint because it adds up to this objective, which is part of this strategy, which adds up to this initiative, which is part of this bet, which will deliver this much impact." It's just not how things work in the real world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):
I feel like a lot of listeners are, like, "That sounds very familiar," exactly what you just described. Again, we're going to talk about what to change and how to make work better to actually align your teams with impact. But I want to first talk about something that follows this thread you're on, which is something you call the Low Impact PM Death Spiral. Talk about what that looks like.

Matt LeMay (00:23:55):
The Death Spiral.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):
I love the hands.

Matt LeMay (00:23:59):
The Low Impact Death Spiral is the dynamic in which every-

Matt LeMay (00:24:00):
... impact death spiral is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in one way or another. And honestly, a lot of small product companies do as well, and it goes something like this. It starts with teams taking on low impact work. Adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements because it's easier, it invites less scrutiny and you're less likely to mess up something important, right? The analogy I use sometimes is if you're working on a car, if you put your hands in the engine, you might make the car run really well or you might make it so that the car doesn't run at all. If you have the option of doing that or decking out the car with a paint job and rhinestones and making it look really, really cool, what are you going to choose to do? I know for me, I would choose the rhinestones every time because then the car runs however it runs. Whoever else is the expert in engines can fix the engine, but I'm going to do this thing which everyone can see. All the executives can look at it and say, "Wow, look at how cool this car looks," and it's not going to do any harm, right? What's the worst that could happen? We can always take the paint off.

(00:25:15):
The problem is if you have 10 teams adding rhinestones to a car, eventually the hood of the car is going to be so heavy that you can't lift it to get to the engine anymore, and that's exactly what happens in most product organizations. As you have more and more teams adding in these little features, making little enhancements, adding features, which might get some usage, but they're not going to take away anything meaningful, they're not going to mess with the commercial engine of the business. You have more folks building in and the hood of the car gets heavier and heavier, the product gets more and more complicated.

(00:25:50):
You have all these little bits that have little dependencies on each other and the product becomes as, I think most modern products are a collection of loosely connected features rather than a single guided experience. What does that mean? That means internally, building anything becomes a lot harder, right? Because there's 10 product teams that have to manage dependencies whenever you want to build something, so companies start adding program management layers. They're like, "We have too many meetings. We need to reorg for program management because reorgs fix everything and we need to make sure that we have all these layers and people are connected and we're doing dependency management." But as you add more of those things, it becomes harder and harder to do high-impact work.

(00:26:33):
The hood just gets heavier and heavier and heavier, which in turn sends teams deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of low-impact work. Low-impact work begets low-impact work. The more low-impact work you do, the harder it is to do high-impact work, the more likely you are to do low-impact work and so on and so forth. It goes and goes and goes until the next round of layoffs, and this is a real problem.

(00:27:01):
I've experienced this at again, pretty much every company I've worked with, and it's been really interesting to see how often the breaking of that cycle comes down to individual product teams being brave enough to look at their own work and look at what matters to the business and say, "You know what? We are not going to incur the risk of being a low-impact team anymore. We are going to proactively seek out high- impact work and we're going to deliver, even if it means we have to coordinate with a lot of other teams. Even if it means that suddenly the executive team takes a really big interest in the work that we're doing. We're going to see that as signs that the work we're doing matters not as things that are going to be an impediment to getting the work done."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):
As you just kind of alluded to, there's a big implication here of even if you are told to build a thing that the execs are really excited about, that is low impact in your opinion, that's no excuse. You're still going to get fired eventually, even though they're telling you to build it. It sucks, but that's how it goes.

Matt LeMay (00:28:04):
It's funny, I worked with MailChimp for three years leading up to their acquisition by Intuit, when they were on this really interesting journey of going from a single product company to a platform company, which is a journey that a lot of companies are on. Where they've found success in one part of the market and they say, "You know what? We recognize that there's a value add in working more horizontally and giving people a suite of tools they can use. We want to build these tools and really make sure that we are meeting the needs of our small and medium business customers."

(00:28:34):
So I was brought on shortly after they did a reorg. They went into a domains model. They had different teams that were supposed to be experts on different parts of this marketing platform that were building in new features and their VP product, Natalia Williams, who then became their CPO, she said, "This is great that we're doing this, but I'm worried that we're going to lose sight of the commercial fundamentals. We have these teams building this really cool stuff and we've been so clear that we're excited about the teams that are working on initiative, that are building these new things, that are building out this platform, but let's make sure we stay focused on making sure that the entire platform grows in a healthy and sustainable way. And that as we are adding in these new features and functionalities, we're not making this so crowded and complicated that it's harder for people to get value out of it."

(00:29:31):
So she set a very clear goal for the product team. She wanted a specific change in the rate of users who successfully send their first email. She was like, "As we build these new things, email is still where people are coming in. We want to make sure that they can do this successfully." And she set a really ambitious goal for the entire product organization. And she put it forth to the product teams and a lot of product teams were understandably hesitant to take this on, for a number of reasons. They said, "If we mess this up, that's the entire commercial heart of the business. That's really risky."

(00:30:12):
Other ones said, "That's great, but we're building out these new parts of the platform that are really important. We don't want to risk slowing those things down." There was one product manager I worked with who really understood how important this was. She had worked on enough different parts of the app at that point. She had been on a growth team, so she really had that kind of user-centric, how do we hit the metrics we need to hit mindset? And she came to me and she was like, "I want to make sure we do this because I'm worried about what'll happen if we don't do this, right? I don't want to be on the product team that failed to deliver what matters most to the business."

(00:30:53):
So she went and worked with some user researchers and found where people were getting stuck. She did this amazing study finding where people were getting stuck before they sent that first email and she gathered together a group of product managers. I'll never forget this. I was on site in Atlanta and she gathered together a group of product managers and she was like, "Look, these are the things we need to fix if we're going to hit this, but if we fix these things, I think we can do it. I think we can get there." And there was a moment of silence where again, for totally understandable reasons, people were like, "Okay, this is great. I see it, but I'm kind of afraid that if we do this," and this product manager, I will never forget that.

(00:31:34):
She looks around the room and she says, "You know what? I'm going to haunt all of you in your dreams if you do not take this on. This is the most important thing for the business." And everyone laughed. It was a strong comment, but it was a strong comment made in really good faith that in its own way, I think acknowledged the fear that people had about taking this on. She was like, "Look, this is really important and if we work together, if we care less about the constraints and parameters and borders of our domains and care more about how we work together to deliver the thing that our leader has told us is the most important thing for the business, we can get this done."

(00:32:15):
And they did get it done, and they got it done through subtracting. They streamlined the experience. They took out steps that people were getting stuck on. They made things easier. They did the kinds of things that are rarely celebrated in the way that traditional feature launches were celebrated, but because they had this clear, impactful, specific sense of what success looks like, they were able to take on that work themselves and it made the product better, made the business better, and it was just a great moment of working with a great team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):
That was an awesome example. I love just how much of a hero's journey this example is. Along those lines, it's interesting how much courage it takes to do this. Because to your point, the easy thing is just, "Okay, everyone's just telling us to do this thing. We're going to build this feature. Great, easy. I don't have to put myself out there." And what you're pointing out there is it's up to you to recognize what you're doing is not high impact and to have courage to push back and suggest something else.

Matt LeMay (00:33:15):
The funny thing is, it's courage, but it's also a kind of radical acceptance of reality. There's a very kind of emotional philosophical dimension to this conversation because I think it is in human nature to not want to be accountable for things outside of our control. Impact is not something we can just check off a list. If we're really working towards business impact, that means that there are things that might happen in the market that are going to affect us, right? Our competitors might launch something, there might be a pandemic or a war or something we didn't expect. We're reliant upon customers to change their behavior, to convert or to upgrade or to do whatever it is we hope they will do.

(00:33:58):
I use the word hope because again, we can do our best to influence that behavior, but we can't just check a box. And I think there is this very understandable human fear of being accountable for things that are beyond our control. I get that so hard, but what I think the last couple of years have shown us is that we are accountable for things outside of our control. The success of the businesses we work for is ultimately beyond our immediate control.

(00:34:26):
And you can follow all the best practices and have the highest velocity and do everything quote-unquote "right", but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to say, "Yeah, we're going out of business, but we're going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0.6 or a 0.7." That's not how it works. The reality is that things outside of our control affect us, and I think that if we can internalize that, there's a real freedom in it. The thing that surprised me most when I was researching this book is that the commercially minded PMs I interviewed were also the happiest, which I did not expect at all.

(00:35:06):
As you said, I come from a music background. I was expecting the business people to be really stressed out, and like, "I have to show up at work 92 hours a day to crush it and make sure that we hit the metrics and crush the numbers." But they were just like, "Yeah, I work for a business and I do the best I can, and then I go home. When I'm at work, my job is to help the business succeed. And I do that by understanding our business model, by trying to do work that contributes to what the business wants. In order to do that, if my goals are really impact level goals, I have to learn about our customers. I have to do discovery, I have to do all these things that we're supposed to do, not because they're abstract best practices, but because that's how you build a successful product."

(00:35:49):
And then at the end of the day, I'm not fighting my company to do product the right way, and if they can't do it the right way, I'm willing to die on this hill. It's like, " I work for a company. I don't get to make every decision. There are things outside of my control. I'll do the best I can, and I get to free up a little bit of energy to live the rest of my life."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):
To make this even less scary, hopefully, I'm curious what your answer is going to be here. Do you find that people who take this leap and push back and try to change the way their teams are thinking and what they take on, do you find that even if they fail, even if they impact wasn't there and the project fails, they're seen more favorably and their career ends up doing better and they end up doing better even if the project fails?

Matt LeMay (00:36:36):
I hope so. I'm always super, again, it's outside of my control. I can't say, if you do these things, then you will be looked upon favorably by the people who manage you because I don't know those people, and maybe they're not going to react well. Maybe they're not actually... People are not always rational, and these things don't always play out the way you hope they will. What I will say is there's a story in the book, in Impact-First Product Teams about somebody who worked for a dating app, and they were given a project to work on, which had a very specific ambitious revenue goal. And at a certain point, it became clear that they were probably not going to be able to hit this because of other things they needed to do.

(00:37:15):
So they went to the finance team and said, "Hey, we have to adjust this down." And the finance team said, "Yeah, of course you do. That makes sense. Let's adjust it down together." Would that conversation have played out the same way if they had not taken that step of saying proactively, " Based on what is happening in the broader world in the market, our product, we no longer believe we are on track to hit this, but we want to adjust so that the company at large can make better predictions and resource things accordingly"?

(00:37:42):
I don't know. But I think again, if you are embracing that mindset that there are things outside of your control and your job is to do what you can from where you sit to contribute to the success of the business, I think you're certainly doing so much more by telling the business honestly what you think is possible and what's going to happen, as opposed to stepping back from it and saying like, "Oh, well, if we talk about it, we're going to get in trouble and nobody's going to believe us." And just that simple withholding of information does its own kind of harm. So I can't guarantee any kind of outcomes. I can't say, "Yes, this will be received with generosity and grace," in all cases, but I think it's the right thing to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:29):
My sense is either you will be respected more highly because you are kind of solving problems for people, like higher ups that you're seeing, things that they should be seeing, and you're right, and they're like, "Oh, wow, Matt's amazing. He saw all this stuff and changed." Or you realize this is not the company for me. They don't value this. They just want me to ship this widget and that's all they want from me. I could do more somewhere else.

Matt LeMay (00:38:56):
Well, I think you touched on something really important there, which is that when you understand the business model, you understand the real world ethics and priorities of the company you work for, right? If you understand what the company's optimizing for, what they really care about, what trade-offs and sacrifices they're willing to make in order to achieve those goals, that tells you a lot more than the mission statement. Which usually sounds great, but if you follow the money, if you follow the decision-making, sometimes it paints a different picture.

(00:39:28):
And I think the more you can understand how the business model works, what that value exchange is, what value is being delivered, what value is being extracted, that I think puts you in a better position to decide, if I were to help the company achieve success, do I feel good about that? Do I feel like this is a company that if it achieves its goals has made the world a better place or not? And the more you understand the business model, the better equipped you are to make those decisions with all the information available to you, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):
That's such an important point.

(00:40:07):
Today's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me, what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment, results, and competitive intel?

(00:40:43):
Claude can handle incredibly complex multi-step work. You can throw 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at claude.ai/lenny and using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's claude.ai/lenny.

(00:41:24):
Okay, so let's shift to talking about how to actually, what to do. This concept of actions you can take regardless of how your company operates. And that first part is really important. Something that I've seen you big on is you don't let people have an excuse for not pushing on this. And we've talked about this in other ways, but just maybe share more of just like you don't have an excuse no matter how your company operates, to not think deeply about this and try to make change.

Matt LeMay (00:41:51):
Yeah, I mean, the reality is that most companies that product managers work at aren't big tech companies. And when I worked with product teams at those companies, at insurance companies or at banks or at CPG companies, or I worked with a company a while ago that makes audio equipment, which was obviously really fun for me, the first thing they usually tell me is, "Well, we can't do product the right way because we're a regulated industry," or, "because we're B2B," or, "because we have these quarterly earnings targets we need to hit."

(00:42:22):
And that always makes me a little sad because yes, there's a way of looking at it where you can say, "All right, if these five famous companies do product management the right way, then anything that puts us in a different situation from those companies must mean that we're doing product management the wrong way," which is demoralizing and distressing, and again, leads people to these kind of quixotic battles of like, "I have to turn a bank into a search engine," which is not going to happen.

(00:42:49):
But the other way of looking at it is that those constraints are how you do product management. Those are what guides you to the commercial decisions you should be making. If you're regulated, your competitors are regulated too. If you can really understand those constraints, figure out how to work well within them, that's a huge commercial advantage for your business. If you're B2B, I honestly prefer working with B2B companies in a lot of situations because they have such immediate access to their customers and they can understand the whole system of their customers and their users and how these things connect in a way that's really immediate and actionable.

(00:43:24):
Similarly, if your company has quarterly financial targets to hit, congratulations, you know what the business really cares about. You don't have to go looking much farther than that. You don't necessarily need to cascade that 10 different levels into 45 OKRs if you can do work that you know feeds directly into what the company cares about the most.

(00:43:47):
So yes, these things are constraints, but they're the constraints that shape the work that we do. And if we embrace them as such, if we treat them as guides, not restrictions, if we say we're working with not against the commercial realities of our business, there's so much we can do. There's so much that product managers and product owners and project managers that everybody working on product at every organization can do if we again work with, not against the realities of the companies we work for.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):
Okay. So I think that's really empowering. You're not saying, "You need to change the way product is built at your company. It's up to you. You're an ICPM, it's up to you. No excuses." What's a simple way to describe what you're actually saying, which I think is going to make people feel a lot better?

Matt LeMay (00:44:38):
What I'm actually saying is that the things you think you're fighting against are usually the things that are giving your work shape, if you let them be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Awesome. Let's talk about, you have three steps, three handy steps to become more of an impact-first product team. So let's talk through them. What is step one?

Matt LeMay (00:44:59):
Yeah, so the first step, and I think the most important and where a lot of my work plays out is in setting team goals, close to company goals. No more than one step away from company goals. This idea comes from Christina Wodtke's book Radical Focus. She had a great episode on your podcast that I just re-watched for inspiration before I came on here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:22):
Nice move.

Matt LeMay (00:45:24):
But in that book, she has this visual where she says that most companies approach cascading OKR as kind of this multi-level, like at the top is company goals, then department goals, then big team goals, then small team goals, and smaller team goals. Which leads to the very situation I described where you can't add those small team goals back up to the company goals. She has a visual that she compares that to, which is the company goal as a center of gravity, and then every other team goal orbiting one level around it. And this blew my mind when I saw it for the first time, because whether you're doing OKRs or KPIs or north star metrics, whatever framework you're ostensibly using, if you use it well, it looks like that.

(00:46:09):
I worked with a team a while ago that was a traditional feature team at a FinTech company. They were the team that was kind of like the team I worked with at MailChimp, kind of given new features to build to take this product and build it more into a multi-product platform. And the business would say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate, they'd say, "Go build this." They'd build it, they'd celebrate. And then the business said, "Okay, we're going to do things a little bit differently. Now we have this top line revenue target. We want to make this much more money next year, and we want you to tell us how you're going to contribute to this."

(00:46:42):
And this was a really challenging conversation for this team because as much as people complain about being feature factories, again, it feels safer, right? There's more control over that. If you're told what to build, you have a lot more control over whether or not you build it than you do over whether or not it generates revenue. So we started having this conversation, what framework should we use? How should we do this? And I was not asking very good questions. I was kind of panicking too, to be honest. And then I asked them, I was like, "Okay, why does this team exist, right? Why are we doing this at all? Why is the business investing in this big team to build all these features? Why do we care if we're a single-product company or a multi-product platform company?"

(00:47:26):
And one of the team leaders said, "Oh, well actually, the customer lifetime value of a multi-product user is much higher than that of a single-product user." I was like, "Oh, do we know how much higher?" And they said, "Yeah, we actually have a number on that." And I was like, "Wow. So if we had a goal of converting a certain number of single-product users to multi-product users, we know exactly how much revenue is on the line." They were like, "Yeah, I guess so." So we were able to set a goal, and from there we had this conversation about what's the number we would need to hit to make this team feel like a good investment? And we came to a specific number and-

Matt LeMay (00:48:00):
To make this team feel like a good investment. And we came to a specific number and that number informed every decision that was made by that team for the rest of the year. We said, "By the end of the year, we need to convert this many single product users to multi-product users because if we do that, there's this much additional revenue which contributes this much to the company's top line revenue goal." It's one step away.

(00:48:22):
And when they went and shared that goal with company leadership, they got it right away. They didn't have to say, "Well, why is this valuable?" They didn't have to say, "What are your other OKRs? Show us the deck." They got it. And that gave them so much leeway to make bolder decisions, to work more closely with other teams to ask for the resources they needed. And that process of arriving at that goal, that goal that is impactful and specific and one step away from what the company cares about the most, is probably the most valuable way I have spent my time with teams of late. Because once you get to that, you see how everything else flows from there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:01):
And the implication here is that if it's too far away from people understanding what the hell are you guys even doing to help the business? That's the problem you want to avoid.

Matt LeMay (00:49:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):
So one extreme is, I don't know, it probably doesn't make sense for your team to have exactly the same goal as the company. Say your company's trying to grow a hundred million revenue rate, that's not going to be your team's goal. So it's almost like that extreme is what's one step away from that? What's your contribution to that company goal?

(00:49:29):
The other end is just some 10 level deep, we're going to improve conversion of this random step, which is going to grow this thing which grows that, and then that grows revenue.

Matt LeMay (00:49:37):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:38):
What is your guidance on revenue-based goals as goals for teams?

Matt LeMay (00:49:43):
I think, again, it depends. I know people have very strong opinions about teams should always or should never have revenue-based goals. I don't think it's that simple. I think sometimes yes, if your company is working towards revenue, having a revenue-based goal makes sense, or at least being able to put some value in terms of revenue on the work that your team is doing. I've worked with some startups where they actively are not going after revenue because right now the name of the game is growth, right? They want to show that they have enough users to raise that next round of investment. I actually worked with one startup where their revenue was going up, and their number of users was going up, and we had to have a really interesting conversation around which one actually matters to our investors. And we kind of wound up developing these two scenarios, the high growth scenario and the low growth scenario.

(00:50:33):
And talking to the product team, it was really clear that there was no way they were going to hit the high growth scenario. So they pivoted to focus on profitability so they could build more runway and raise that next round as a smaller business with a sustainable revenue base.

(00:50:46):
So I get why people are hesitant to commit to revenue goals. I think that there are certainly situations where revenue goals would be too broad or not exactly what the business needs, but at the end of the day, money is how the impact of most teams is going to be measured. And if you don't have a point of view on why your team is a good investment, either in the money return it brings, or in another return that is equally or more important to the business, then again, that feels like a tenuous and risky position to be in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:25):
To kind of get people's brains noodling in the right direction. What are some examples of good goals, like specific goals that your teams have set that are one step away from a company goal? What are just some examples without naming companies?

Matt LeMay (00:51:38):
I have a story to tell to that effect, which also sets up the second step here, which is to keep impact first at every step.

(00:51:47):
So, I worked with a growth team at a tech company that is beloved by many the people. And I was brought on to help them set OKRs, right? The company was doing OKRs across the board, and this team was going to set its growth OKRs. So they had done a lot of reading, a lot of research into how to do OKRs the right way. They had read, unfortunately, they had not read Radical Focus or they hopefully would've done things differently, they had read a lot of other books. They had printed out a lot of articles and they said, "We're going to make sure we get this right. We're going to put together a slide deck that has five to seven objectives with five to seven key results each, and each key result is going to have an owner and we're going to make sure that people are accountable for it. And we're going to really, really do this the right way. We're going to get that middle piece perfect."

(00:52:39):
So they spent a long time working on these OKRs, OKR season ends. They file away the OKR deck not to be seen until the next OKR season. We reconvene, and spend a whole day scoring all of the OKRs. And there are heated conversations about what's a 0.6 versus a 0.7? Is this a 0.9? Who really should be the owner of this key result? Who contributed the most to it? And we get through this whole conversation, everyone's tired. And I'm like, "There's just one question I need to ask. I'm so sorry to do this to y'all, but how does this all add up to the company level growth goals?"

(00:53:23):
People look around and they're like, "Well, that wasn't what we did. We set our team level OKRs and we went through the process and we made sure, and we followed the OKRs, we thought about the OKRs," and I said, "Yeah, but the company has a goal of let's call it bringing on a million new users in this year. We're a growth team. How many users did we bring on?"

(00:53:50):
And there's a moment of silence. And the leader of this team's a really, really good leader. She stands and she's like, "Okay, we're going to do things differently." She steps up to the whiteboard, puts 1 million on the right end of the whiteboard, draws a line, "This is the year," draws a little tick on the line. "This is where we are now. It's a smaller number than a million. This is where we need to get to. If our conversation doesn't start with this, I don't want to have the conversation. And if you are 51% sure that a different approach is going to get us 1% closer, I expect you to advocate for that approach. And this is now how we are going to do everything."

(00:54:34):
And I think about that all the time, because it's subtracting steps. It's making things less complicated. It actually is doing exactly what you described. It's saying, "This is what the company cares about. We're the growth team. We need to figure out how everything we're doing contributes to this."

(00:54:55):
That story really stuck with me because it seems like it should be obvious, right? If you're the growth team at a company with a growth goal, obviously that's going to be something you care about. But it's so easy in the day-to-day work of setting these intermediate goals, of doing strategy, of doing the things we do to make things just a little bit more complicated than they need to be. So for this particular team and this particular moment, a good goal was looking at the company level goal and saying, "If we're the team that's driving growth, we're accountable for this. We're going to step up and we're going to do everything we can to make sure, the company meets its ambition."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):
And it's so obvious if you come at it from the perspective you shared earlier. If you're the CEO, would you fund this team? If you see our goal is a million users, this team will drive us a hundred thousand users. Assuming that's a lot for you. Obviously we want that team to do great and we're going to give them the resources to do that. They're going to contribute meaningfully to this goal. It's very obvious as you see it. The trick is a lot of people think they're doing that and they're not. Maybe one heuristic I think about as you're talking is just like, how do you know if you're doing this? There should be a very simple spreadsheet formula of just here's the company goal, here's your goal. There should be one simple formula that translates up that adds to it.

Matt LeMay (00:56:20):
One Y statement and or one mathematical operator is usually the way I think about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:24):
There we go.

Matt LeMay (00:56:26):
In some cases, like the story I told about that FinTech company, it's something like upgraded users. That's one step, right? You multiply that by the increased customer lifetime value. In some cases, it's a smaller unit of the same thing. So it's a subset of the revenue or growth that the company's trying to deliver.

(00:56:47):
I worked with a company recently that had a team rebuilding their ad tech platform. This is a big company that does a lot of different things, and at the heart of all of their different offerings is this ad tech platform. And I was brought on to do a day long workshop with this company because this was a really important team and they were struggling to figure out what success looked like.

(00:57:06):
So I said, "Okay, what are your goals?" And they said, "Here's the deck with our goals." I said, "That's a lot of goals. I wouldn't be able to make decisions with those goals." They said, "Oh wait, wait, wait, no, we also have a Miro board. We went through this and we decided the deck was too much. So we also have a Miro board," but as Miro boards tend to do, it kind of grew and grew and grew in all directions. So now it's a big board. Turned out they had two Miro boards because they had tried to do this twice.

(00:57:33):
So we sat down and we did this really interesting kind of subtractive exercise, where everybody got a post-it note to write down what they think the most important goal of the team is. And then they would pair up and they would have to make it smaller each time, make it more concise. If there were two things, get it down to one thing. If there were 10 words, bring it down to eight words, make it smaller and more concise each time.

(00:57:56):
And we came up with two options. One was build a fantastic, wonderful, magical, beautiful platform to increase our team's profits by 20%. Fair enough. The other one was, build a stupendous, wonderful, fantastic platform to increase our team's profits in the next financial year from 20 million pounds to a hundred million pounds.

(00:58:18):
And I'm looking at these and I'm like, "Okay, so we know that there is an expectation of revenue here. There's an expectation that we will drive profitability, but one of these is 20% and the other is 500%. Where do these numbers come from?" And the folks who had said 20%, they were like, "That feels like a good return." And what's interesting was when I was telling the story, when I was giving some talks recently, and people would kind of laugh like, "Oh, they named the wrong number." But they were so brave to do that, and them saying 20% is what actually unlocked the conversation at the team level, because somebody else in the room heard that and said, "Wait, I do remember something about profits. There was some target we were supposed to hit, but I think I remember it being a lot bigger than that." And they actually went back and found a town hall that their VP had given and buried in a slide in that town hall was this hundred million pound profit target by the end of the next financial year.

(00:59:22):
So they have this number and they start to go like, "Oh gosh, that's a lot, but it's a whole financial year. It'll be fine." And we do, again, inspired by that leader I worked with, I just put this out on a whiteboard. I'm like, "All right, a hundred million in profits by the end of the next financial year right now we're here. What else should be on this timeline?" Somebody said, "Well, we're launching this in October." So I put October up there. I go, "Okay, so if we don't ship anything until October, and right now it's March, how much profit do we make until?" And they said, "About 10 million." I'm like, "Okay. So that means that between October and March, we need to generate 90 million pounds of profits."

(01:00:06):
And this team, I was worried they were going to freak out or they were going to be like, "Oh, we can't do this. It's impossible." But they were like, "Okay, it's time to step up. It's time to do all these things that we need to do. We need to ship sooner. We need to do more validation. We need to do more testing. Can we commercialize things sooner? Can we do more discovery to make sure that this is really going to have the impact we need to have? Why are we doing this whole big relaunch? Why don't we rebuild individual things? What impact will we have if we brought more people in top of funnel now? Can we begin building our user base and then upgrade that user base? What are the trade-offs if we do that versus if we bring people in?"

(01:00:41):
All those things that I think is really the heart and the intent of these best practices. They came to life because this team had clarity. They understood like, "Okay, we are accountable for something which is specific enough to drive some real urgency, and which is impactful enough that we have to get out there and do all these things that we're supposed to do."

(01:01:05):
So that to me, is a really good example of how if you start with this question of like, well, what's expected of this team? What does success look like for us? It'll often lead you to the right neighborhood of what kind of unit of measure you want to look for, how the business is going to look to you, whether they're looking directly at revenue, whether they're looking at something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:29):
Okay. These stories are awesome. So basically, so far, the two steps that you've illustrated here of doing this correctly, step one is set team goals that are close to company goals. And then step two is, do this at every step of the product building process. It's not just a one-time thing at the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:01:46):
Right. As you're doing OKRs, like that team I talked about, when you're thinking about your company strategy, when you're writing epics, whatever it is, keep that impactful goal top of mind. Don't let it slip away. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):
Because to your point, the examples you shared where you think you're just like, "Cool, we have our goal, let's go." And then you spend months doing this thing and then you forget, okay, this actually got disconnected from the company goal.

Matt LeMay (01:02:12):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):
Everything you've worked hard to do is just, no one cares.

Matt LeMay (01:02:15):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):
Okay. What is step three?

Matt LeMay (01:02:18):
Step three is to connect every bit of work back to impact. So this is when we get to the prioritization piece, right.

(01:02:26):
So impact estimation is something that is written about quite well, quite extensively in product management stuff, but it's something that it's easy to not do. I work with a lot of teams that want to know, again, the right best practice for doing prioritization, whether that's should we use ICE or RICE or MoSCoW or whatever it is, what's the right way to do prioritization? And again, it depends, but if you don't have a clear and specific sense of what impact means, you can't really prioritize effectively. So this is where, again, everything comes back to that first step of the way you set goals.

(01:03:13):
So that team I told you about that had the goal of converting single product users to multi-product users, one of the product managers on that team came back to me a few months later and said, "Hey, Matt, I could really use your help figuring out how to do prioritization. Should we do ICE? Should we do RICE? Should we do MoSCoW? I put together an ICE matrix where I scored impact and I scored certainty and I scored effort, and I multiplied each one by each one, and I have a list of the things we should do."

(01:03:38):
And I said, "That's awesome." And I do really think it's awesome when people take the initiative to do the thing to say, "I put this together, let's walk through it." So when they showed me this, I said, "Let's start with impact." They're like, "Okay, well here's the score for each one." I was like, "What's the score?" They're like, "Oh, it's a lot of different things." And I said, "Okay, well, we have a team goal of a certain specific number of users we need to convert by the end of the year, so let's try to express impact as a function of that goal. So rather than an abstract score, what is the most number of users we could convert in each of these different scenarios?"

(01:04:18):
And understandably, they were kind of like, "Oh, you know what? I don't know exactly." I'm like, "Let's, just work through it. We don't have to be precise. It's called impact estimation, not impact getting perfect number." So for one of them, they were like, "Well, we can do this landing page." I'm like, "Okay, well how many people hit the landing page?" And they were like, "Not that many, maybe a few hundred." I'm like, "Okay, cool. So that's maybe a few hundred."

(01:04:43):
And there was one thing which they were really reluctant. It had a high effort score and a medium certainty score. And what they basically said was like, "Look, if we really wanted to do this, we could redesign the entire onboarding experience. We can make it so that rather than us trying to retroactively shuttle people into multi-product usage, we can understand them when they join and get them into the right category of user right away."

(01:05:08):
I'm like, "That sounds amazing." What's the most impact that could have? They were like, "It would get us all the way there if we did it right, but we'd have to work with these other teams and we'd have to work with marketing. And there are so many dependencies and so many things outside of our control that we don't know if we could do it." And I said, "That's okay. These are the trade-offs we make as product managers, you will have some things to work on that are going to have less impact, but might be easier and more certain to deliver. But if this thing could get us all the way there, if it's really the only thing we're looking at, which has really any chance of getting us to our goal, which remember we came up with to answer the question, what does this team need to deliver to be a good investment for the business, then I think it's worth going for it.

(01:05:55):
"It's worth having those conversations with other product teams. It's worth talking to folks in marketing. It's worth stretching ourselves a little bit and saying, 'This is going to be challenging to do, but if we can do it, we can really deliver on something which we're going to feel great about.'"

(01:06:11):
So the way that third step manifests itself the most frequently, tactically is are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest and we're saying, "Does this actually have a chance of contributing?" Whereas again, if we get really clever and we come up with a proprietary scoring system and all these little intermediate steps, we can feel like we're doing really awesome work and being very, very terribly smart. But we again, run the risk that we are going to lose our connection with why we're setting about to do this work in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):
Such an important and often easily overlooked point. This idea that when you're doing RICE or whatever version of ICE that you do, that impact should be based on impact to your goal, which is one level removed from the company goal. It feels so obvious as you talk about it, and I hope most people know this, but I feel like that's something people forget. Just like, what is impact? Oh yeah, customers will be happier.

Matt LeMay (01:07:16):
Again, this is not easy work, right? Working in product means that we have so many different perspectives, so many different folks who have so many different priorities. The stakeholder management piece of this is relentless and exhausting, and it's really, really easy to lose sight of this stuff. And it takes work and discipline and as you said, bravery to keep bringing it back. But I think again, it is not only the right thing to do, but it helps you at the end of the day, have a little bit more of a boundary between the work you're doing at your job and the stuff you're good at in your life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):
Speaking of boundaries, a lot of the advice you share will involve people saying no, and pushing back, and convincing people they're wrong, which is very hard. That's not a natural happy place for most people.

Matt LeMay (01:08:12):
Nope.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):
What advice do you have? What have you learned works well for pushing back, helping people see how they're not... What they want you to build is wrong.

Matt LeMay (01:08:24):
So this is where I have the benefit, I suppose, of being a conflict-averse, people pleaser. So I've been through this, and I think the thing I am proudest of saying in product management and practice is that if you're doing product management really well, you never have to say yes and you never have to say no. You're giving people options and you're helping them understand the trade-offs.

(01:08:52):
So in keeping with this idea that there are things outside of your control, as a product manager, you're not always going to be the one who makes the decision. There are going to be other people who come to you and say, "Build this," or who say, "I don't see the value in that. Do this, do that. I want this, I want that." If those people are in a position of formal authority in the organization, I've certainly never had luck telling them no.

(01:09:16):
Furthermore, I've found myself in situations where they just know things that I don't know. Where they're pursuing an acquisition, so there are certain things that we have to do or can't do. Where there's some serious financial challenge that they're working their way through right now, which is shifting around priorities, but they are not at liberty to discuss that with the broader organization. It is quite possible that the folks who are asking you to do things that don't make sense, have access to information that you don't. And that in trying to convince them otherwise, you are not only going to fail, but you are going to lose some of that trust and degrade that relationship that could in time be really important for you. So I think the challenge is to say, "All right, you want me to build this thing? Maybe. Let's look at the different things."

(01:10:15):
If you're going through these steps, if you say, "I understand, here's what our team's goals are, here's the stuff we're prioritizing, here's the impact we think it could have." If you're coming to me with something which is going to have more impact, heck yeah, I would love to build that. That sounds amazing.

(01:10:29):
But if it has an unclear impact or if it doesn't tie into this, then we might need to adjust the impact we're seeking to have. If this is suddenly really important, as with that story that was told in the book, right? Sometimes it's like, all right, we got to do this. Sure. That means that our impact projection is going to have to be adjusted this much.

(01:10:48):
You're not saying no, you're not saying yes. You're helping someone who is in a position to make a decision, understand the trade-offs that go into that decision. And again, if you can do that, you're going to go home at the end of the day feeling better. You're going to feel less like you lost a battle or that you were overridden by an unjust tyrant, and it's going to be more like, "Okay, I made sure they had all the information I would want to have if I were making that decision. That decision is ultimately theirs to make, and I'm going to do the best I can."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):
Tell me if you disagree. In my experience, you also want to recommend a path. Because a lot of people don't want PMs just, "Here's all the options. I have no opinion, no bias of any kind. You decide." I find that people want you to have a perspective.

Matt LeMay (01:11:33):
Absolutely. Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula. I did when I was working with MailChimp, we actually did a workshop with all the product managers at the company where we had people roleplay trying to sell in a single option versus multiple options with a recommendation. And it was amazing how when you present a single option, people's instinct is just to, well, I don't know, you start poking holes in it. Not because you're a jerk, but because-

Matt LeMay (01:12:00):
You start poking holes in it, not because you're a jerk, but because you're looking at one thing and you're like, "Oh, well, what about this? What about that?"

(01:12:07):
Again, all of your own anxieties and fears and the things that you don't feel represented in there, and where you're worried, "What if this happens? What if that happens?"

(01:12:14):
All of that kind of detracts from the momentum, whereas if you come in and say, "Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend," then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer and stronger.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):
I feel like people might miss that nuance, in the way we talked about it, so I think that's a really important point to make there.

(01:12:35):
Let me come back to the three steps, just for folks that are, "Cool, I'm excited, I'm motivated. I'm going to change the way we operate." I'll summarize real quick.

(01:12:44):
So step one is, set team goals close to company goals. Step two is keep impact first at every step. Don't forget, as you're building throughout the year. And then, step three is connect every bit of work back to impact.

Matt LeMay (01:12:57):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):
I think, again, it's important to remind people, this may be hard and annoying, and maybe things are going fine. Everyone's telling you what to build, you're building and shipping, and things are, it seems to be going all right.

(01:13:11):
I think an important part of this is just, if you believe what you're building is not helping the business grow and succeed, either, they'll let you go someday, because you're not doing something that matters. Or the business will not work out, and you'll be in trouble.

(01:13:27):
So it's like, even if you don't want to do this something, you need to really seriously think about this, even though it's really hard.

Matt LeMay (01:13:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):
But maybe let me just think of that a little bit. Say the business is doing great, everything's great. The CEO's telling you all the things to build, that sales guys and girls are just like, "Here, ship these features, everything's great."

(01:13:46):
And everything's working, business is growing. What thoughts there? Is it just, "Nah, leave it alone?" Or is your sense, "Okay, most often this will not last," and you should really start to work on these skills?

Matt LeMay (01:13:56):
It's funny, the teams I've worked with, when things are going well, are sometimes just as anxious as the teams I've worked with, when things are going poorly, because they have a hard time attributing success to what they're doing, right?

(01:14:08):
They'll look at it and they'll say, "Yeah, we're doing great. But I think that honestly has more to do with marketing than it does with us."

(01:14:14):
Or, "Yeah, we're doing great, but we're just in the right place at the right time. Our business is doing really well, our sector is doing really well. We're just growing along with everyone else who's growing."

(01:14:24):
And I think, as with most things, if you approach it with curiosity, there's a lot to learn from it. So if you look at it, and you say, "Yeah, we can't necessarily take sole credit for this, but Marketing's doing awesome. Let's talk to them. What are they doing? Why is this going so well? What have they learned from this, that we can work with them more closely?"

(01:14:46):
If your sector is just doing really well, be like, okay, well what about this is working right now? What might change in the future? How can we understand this?"

(01:14:54):
So I think the challenge, when things are going well, is to keep that curiosity going, and to keep celebrating the things, not just that your team is doing, but that everyone is doing, and to take that time, where you have a little bit more leeway, where there's less pressure on you in the moment, to build those connections with other parts of the organization, to see where that really good work is happening.

(01:15:21):
One thing that makes me sad is when teams look upon each other with envy and disgust, right, when it's, "This team's doing, they're doing great work, but they're not held to the same standards that we are, and it's not fair, and they're the team that everyone likes."

(01:15:37):
It's like, "Go talk to them, because there's probably something you can learn from them. And if they're the team that's getting positive attention, that's doing meaningful work, there's probably a reason for that. And if you can understand that reason, and you can align your work, that team's work, that's probably going to be really good for you."

(01:15:58):
Again, I think, in a lot of cases, it comes back down to that control thing, right? If we can't feel a sense of control over, "Things are going well because we did this," we tend to disconnect ourselves from things going well and say, "Well, I can't. It almost feels dangerous to engage with it because, what if we didn't do anything, but good things are still happening."

(01:16:21):
And I think, just keeping that openness, keeping that curiosity going, puts you in a much better position for when things inevitably begin to either plateau or decline, which is the cyclical nature of all things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):
Wow. Profound there. To start to wrap up our conversation, what's maybe one question from the book, or even from this conversation, that you think product leaders, product teams should ask themselves to help them solve problems, that maybe they're not seeing, and to help their team operate better?

Matt LeMay (01:16:53):
I mean, I love the, "Would you fund this team, if you were the CEO question?" I know that that can feel a little confrontational sometimes. So, a gentler way of bringing that up is to say, "What's one sentence you'd want to be able to say at the end of this year, that would leave you feeling awesome about this team's work? What's something?"

(01:17:11):
At the end of the year, everything went really well for this team. You run into the CEO in the hallway, and you say, "I feel awesome, because we did this." '.

(01:17:20):
And you'll sometimes get very different answers from different people on the team, building on those answers, saying, "Okay, this is what you care about. This is what I care about. This is what I'm worried about. This is what I'm excited about."

(01:17:33):
That's how you get that magical, people in a room building together, or musicians in a room writing their next song, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
What a call, back to the beginning.

Matt LeMay (01:17:40):
And then-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):
I love this.

Matt LeMay (01:17:43):
It's getting that conversation out in the open, and getting people to talk about their perspectives and their expectations, with the goal of bringing it together, to create something better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):
Bam. Matt, is there anything else that you wanted to cover or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Matt LeMay (01:18:03):
I think we covered it. I just leave people with, again, this hope that you can start to see the commercial realities and constraints of your business as opportunities, as guideposts, as things that shape and structure your work, not as things that you single-handedly need to change, or break down, or transform, because you probably can't. And that's okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):
That's empowering stuff. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Matt LeMay (01:18:37):
As ready as I'm going to be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:39):
Question one. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Matt LeMay (01:18:43):
Radical Focus, by Christina Wodtke, is obviously, I cite it a lot in my book, I think it's the best book about OKRs. I love her style of writing. I love the way she tells stories.

(01:18:56):
I love the focus on focus, this idea that again, the way you do it is less important than the result of the way of doing it. I just find that so inspiring, always.

(01:19:08):
The other book, this is a bit of a curveball, is by Alan Watts, the Buddhist philosopher. It's called The Wisdom of Insecurity. And a lot of the way I talk about control, and giving up control, comes from that book.

(01:19:23):
It also has a concept. It opens with a concept called the law of reverse effort, which is that sometimes, the harder you try, the worse you make things. When it comes to setting goals, doing OKRs, doing strategy, I think about this a lot, that there is a tendency sometimes to put effort towards the overcomplication of things, which in turn makes those things less effective, what they're ultimately intended to achieve. So, highly recommend that book. It helped me a lot through some dark times, mentally.

(01:19:59):
There's an idea in the book. He talks about how trying to keep yourself perpetually safe in an imagined future is effectively killing yourself to the present. And ooh, that hit hard. That hit me really, really, really hard. So, highly recommend that book.

(01:20:18):
If the things we've talked about today make you even a fraction of, as anxious and fearful as they make me when I navigate them in my work, then I highly recommend The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:32):
I was going to ask what the title is, because that sounds really powerful. Amazing, amazing pick.

(01:20:37):
Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Matt LeMay (01:20:41):
God. So especially, when I'm in work-y write-y mode, my brain shuts off to all things that are not trash. So I have been watching a lot of trash.

(01:20:53):
I watched Temptation Island, the new season of Temptation Island on Netflix. I loved it so much. It's Mark L. Wahlberg, who is the host of Antiques Roadshow, just weaponizing therapyspeak to torture people, in this bizarre scenario.

(01:21:15):
And I should not love it, but I am only a human, and a messy bitch who lives for the drama, sometimes, so ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):
So good.

Matt LeMay (01:21:26):
I know. I enjoyed that very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:27):
I think it's the first Temptation Island call-out, and I love it. Okay, favorite product or ... Yeah, favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?

Matt LeMay (01:21:37):
Yeah, so I'm really glad you asked this question, because as a musician, I live in this world of niche products, which is so much fun, because the economies of scale for music creators are just totally different, right?

(01:21:48):
You don't need to build a product that's going to have a billion users, and create a huge return. You can do something that a few hundred or a few thousand people get a lot of use out of and love. You're in this fun realm of hybrid, physical and digital, and different types of things. And when you asked me this question, the first thing that came to mind was this, which is made by an amplifier builder who goes by Milkman Sound, in the San Francisco Bay area, who took, basically, the circuit of a Fender amplifier, and made a version of it that fits into this handy, compact, lightweight form factor.

(01:22:35):
So for me, as somebody who is no longer 22 years old, and still occasionally tours with my friend's band, and has back problems, the fact that I can carry this really powerful amplifier around, in this really well-designed, aesthetically pleasing form factor, just feels like such a joy. It's one of those products that really understands what quality means to its particular audience.

(01:23:09):
And I can go on tour, and have things sound really nice, without having to lug a giant, heavy thing. And I love that. It's something for which I am truly grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):
This makes me want to play music randomly, but just so I understand how this works, do you still plug that into a speaker, or is that-

Matt LeMay (01:23:30):
Yeah, so I have a little speaker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:32):
Okay. Oh, okay.

Matt LeMay (01:23:32):
You can also plug direct into the soundboard at a club, or for recording.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:36):
Okay, got it.

Matt LeMay (01:23:37):
And it has a little headphone jack, too. So if I want to practice in the hotel room, before you play, I can also use this.

(01:23:45):
It does everything you would need this device to do, and nothing more, and it does it really well. And that is so delicious to me, to have a product-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):
Another great pick.

Matt LeMay (01:24:01):
... that I'm like, "This does exactly what I need. It does it so well, and it's a delightful product."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:11):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work, or in life?

Matt LeMay (01:24:17):
I come back to something my mom told me. I'm sure you've experienced this, too. When you're a person creating things in the world, there's a tendency to look at the numbers, and look at, "How am I doing? And did this resonate? Is this good? Did this work?"

(01:24:31):
And I've definitely worked on things, especially in my musical life, where the amount of effort and love, and time and care that went into something, didn't feel like it showed up in the result of that thing, or the way it was received.

(01:24:48):
I was talking to my mom about this once, and she said, "I really believe that no good work is wasted. Even if you don't see it right away, when you put good work out into the world, even if it only finds a few people, it's never wasted. If you do work you really believe in, it's going to have some positive effect on the world."

(01:25:10):
And that really stuck with me. I've carried that with me, even when I think about how to write, and what to say, and when I start to worry about outsmarting myself, and should I be more strategic in the way I message this, and should I say something I don't really totally believe?

(01:25:34):
There've been a few times, not recently, but a few times, 10 years ago, where I dabbled in writing click bait-y headlines, because I was like, "Ooh, is this going to get more attention?" And there was one in particular, that got really thoughtful critique from some people I really respect.

(01:25:49):
I was like, "I don't want to do this. I don't want to put work I don't believe in out into the world," and even if it doesn't do what I hoped it would do, I'm going to go forth with the belief that no good work has wasted.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:03):
I totally believe that. Final question. You wrote a ton of music reviews over the years. I'm curious if there's one that was just very, people super disagreed with it, or just one that you're super proud of?

Matt LeMay (01:26:19):
I mean, I am a villain, in certain corners of the internet-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):
Say more.

Matt LeMay (01:26:23):
... for the review I wrote of Liz Phair's self-titled album. I wrote this review when I was 19, when my worldview was toxic, and very much in progress. It was a really condescending, arrogant review, written from a place of unearned condescension and arrogance.

(01:26:46):
Not that condescension and arrogance should necessarily be earned, but it felt righteous at the time, in a way that is dangerous, right? That toxic righteousness where you're like, "I'm fighting something bad." But then you realize that what you're fighting is not actually bad.

(01:27:09):
You're actually punching sideways and down, but you don't have the wherewithal and the maturity to realize that you are not where you think you are, in relation to people and culture, and yourself. So I apologized for that review in 2019, and Liz Phair and I actually had a really nice little Twitter back and forth.

(01:27:34):
This was back when Twitter was still a place where this kind of thing could happen, and it was nice to wrap that up in that way. I still don't feel good about it, because it was playing into some really toxic and hurtful dimensions of discourse.

(01:28:06):
But what can you do, if not look back on it and say, "Yeah, I was wrong. I was just flat-out wrong, and beyond being wrong, I was being a jerk." Somebody posted this, a meme creator on Instagram, posted that review a couple months ago, with a caption, " Matt LeMay, you will be dealt with."

(01:28:31):
And I was like, "Yeah, yeah. If I read that now, I would probably say something pretty similar." So I think, as I said, I'm a conflict averse people pleaser.

(01:28:48):
I went through my kind of edgelord phase. And I don't think it did any good for me, or for anyone else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):
Wow. That was a much more profound answer than I expected. I can't believe people are still referencing this review from a long time ago. How many years? How ...

Matt LeMay (01:29:08):
22? It was 2003, so it was 22 years ago. It was more than half my life ago. But this is the wild thing, is that on the internet, it still looks new.

(01:29:19):
The first talk I ever gave, in London, actually, was at a Red Monk event, and I brought my teenage diary with me, to make the point that if something has 10 years of age on it as paper, it's contextualized by its own material existence, right?

(01:29:36):
But somebody will go, "Oh, I wonder what Pitchfork thought of this record," they'll see my jerk-ass review, and be, "Pitchfork published this jerk-ass review. Who was the jerk-ass reviewer who wrote it?"

(01:29:48):
And they'll find me, and be like, "Hey, you, you're a jerk-ass, because you wrote this jerk-ass review." And I'll be like, "Yes, I did write that jerk-ass review, from the place of being a jerk-ass." But I like to think I am a person who has lived 22 years of life since then.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:11):
Your frontal cortex has developed more since then. I think it doesn't stop-

Matt LeMay (01:30:13):
God, I hope so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:14):
Until 25, 26. Matt, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to, and more.

(01:30:22):
Two follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online, talk about the sort of work you do with companies, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt LeMay (01:30:29):
Yeah, so you can find me online at matlemay.com, pretty straightforward, and in terms of how folks can be useful to me, hopefully I can be useful to them, whether that's through the books, or through coming into work with your company, and help your teams focus.

(01:30:47):
I find that facilitating these conversations is a really big value add. It's hard to have these conversations to do this without some outside help sometimes. So again, whether it's in book form or in me form, I hope that I can be useful to you, and having these conversations in a way that's less scary, more accessible, and leads you down that road to doing impactful work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):
Awesome, and mattlemay.com. And then, what's the name of the book? Where do they find it

Matt LeMay (01:31:15):
Impact-First Product Teams. You can find it at all the places where you find books, on Amazon. There's an author read audiobook, which I recorded right here in this room, with this microphone. I did all the musical interludes myself ...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:28):
Why?

Matt LeMay (01:31:30):
Because it was a great way to procrastinate, when I did not actually want to read the book. But I hope you will find it fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:39):
Matt, thank you so much for being here.

Matt LeMay (01:31:41):
Thanks so much, Lenny. This was great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):

# Are your fears giving you terrible advice? | Matt Mochary

## Transcript

Matt Mochary (00:00:00):
The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on to Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera, because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You don't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. And of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. So, that's the most important thing.

Lenny (00:01:08):

Lenny (00:01:34):
We are so fortunate that Matt agreed to join me on this podcast and in our conversation we cover a lot of ground. We talk about why learning to fire people is one of the most important skills as a leader and how to do it well, why anger and fear often point you in the exact opposite direction you should be going, how to innovate within a larger company, how his coaching has evolved over the years, where the most successful founders still struggle, and so much more. This may be my new favorite episode and I bet it will be years, too. So much real talk with tactics, templates, all kind of goodness. Enjoy this conversation with Matt Mochary.

Lenny (00:04:43):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Mochary (00:04:47):
Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:04:49):
I am looking forward to it even more. The way I learned about you is back in the day I read this book called The Great CEO Within, which I have right here, and I was like, holy moly, this is the most tactical, practical, useful book I've seen for leaders. I need to tell everyone about it, and I did. Then a few weeks ago, someone shared a link in my newsletter Slack community to this document that is called the Mochary Method Curriculum Document. I was like, oh my god, this is the most practical, tactical, useful document I've seen in a long time. I got to share this with everyone, and I did. Then I realized it's the same person that wrote these two things, and so I reached out to you and you kindly agreed to join me on this podcast. And so again, really appreciate you being here.

Matt Mochary (00:05:30):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:32):
Give folks a little bit of background on you who aren't so familiar with you, and just to help understand a little bit of a how you got so wise. Can you give folks just kind of a brief overview of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career, maybe some of the folks you've worked with and how you got to what you do now?

Matt Mochary (00:05:47):
Right on. I've had a very varied career. I started a company back in internet 1.0 called Totality, which was a good financial outcome. Then I went and just had fun for a long time and then I went and did social good and helped ex-convicts get and keep a job by becoming truck drivers. All that was super fun, but I realized I missed my peers and I wanted to get back into the tech world, but I didn't want to start a company because a company is a lot of work and the end result is you make a lot of money, but I didn't need money.

Matt Mochary (00:06:15):
And so I thought, how could I get in the tech world and not actually have to do the hard work? Oh, I could be a coach. I could coach people and then I just get to do the fun stuff and advise them and then they have to do the hard work. And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms.

Matt Mochary (00:07:07):
It's been a ton of fun and for me, I do things for joy and each and every one of these interactions has been massively joyful for me and the people I coach become my really close friends, so it's all very selfish on my part.

Lenny (00:07:21):
I feel you on a lot of that. I also tried to explore starting a company again and similarly decided this is way too much stress and work, what else can I do instead? And that's what led to the work I do now, which I love.

Matt Mochary (00:07:33):
Right on.

Lenny (00:07:34):
How long have you been doing this coaching?

Matt Mochary (00:07:36):
That whole process started about 10 years ago, so about 10 years.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Awesome. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and the internet and ahead of this chat I polled folks on Twitter and asked them what they would ask you if they were chatting with you, so I thought I'd start off with asking you a few those questions and then we'll dig into a few very specific topics that I'm excited to talk about. The first question comes from Leo Polovets who's a GP at Susa Ventures, and he asked, "Matt has coached some incredible founders, what are some of the most common areas where even the most successful founders still struggle?"

Matt Mochary (00:08:11):
Great question. To me, the bar is fear and how strongly do people feel fear? There are few people that I coach that just don't feel fear at all. And frankly with them, we have very tactical conversations, but they're the minority. The most feel fear to some degree, some feel it a lot, some feel it less, but when they feel it grips their mind and it prevents them from seeing... It prevents them from doing the thing that is difficult but necessary, so that's a lot of what our coaching is, me pointing out to them, hey, I think you're in fear.

Matt Mochary (00:08:55):
What happens is very early on in coaching they'll go, yeah, okay, I'm in fear. So what? I go, great. I believe that fear is actually giving you bad advice and I think you're predicting that if you do this A will happen. Well, I'm predicting that if you do that, the exact opposite will happen. So, I'll tell you what, why don't we make a bet? This is very high stakes, why don't we pick something that's lower stakes? You make a prediction, we'll see if I make the opposite and then let's bet on it. So we pick something and then we make a bet on it, and whoever wins the bet in the future gets to determine what the actions are.

Matt Mochary (00:09:31):
I've made this bet hundreds of times and so far, I've never lost. It's not because I'm magician or a genius, it's because when someone's in fear, they're gripped. They can't see reality, their brain is making very exaggerated predictions. Whereas when someone is not in fear, and I'm not because it's not my situation, I am not gripped and therefore, my brain isn't making exaggerated predictions. And so, we make this bet once I win, then all of a sudden the CEO realizes, oh my God, there's something to this, fear gives bad advice. Then after that, all I need to do is remind the person that I perceive them to be in fear. That's all it takes, and they're like, oh, okay, and then they go ahead and do the thing that they feel fear about. Then of course, later they come back to me and say, Matt, that was magical. It works so well.

Matt Mochary (00:10:23):
I mean, I'll give you examples. The most extreme is when a CEO realizes that there's a problem in the business and they haven't told their board yet and their board doesn't know, and remember, their board is their investors, and they have another round coming up, they know they're going to have to raise money in another six to 12 months. They need their current investors to participate in the upcoming round, otherwise outside investors won't. Then they say, well, what the hell do I do? I've got this problem. Do I tell my investors? And most often, the knee jerk reaction is, no, I'm not going to tell them.

Matt Mochary (00:11:01):
Then I say, "Well, I think that's fear. I think if you actually tell them, tell your investors, the exact opposite of what we think is going to happen is going to happen. You think you're going to lose their trust. I think you're going to gain their trust." And so, if we've done this fear exercise before, they do it, they share transparently with their board all the problems and say, and I'm excited to tackle these problems. Every single time that's happened, the board members have said, "This is fantastic. I love this honesty. Thank you so much. This is one of the only companies that I'm on the board of that actually is transparent and honest," and they gain trust.

Lenny (00:11:42):
I'm glad that you brought this topic up. I wanted to spend time on it. Just to double click a little bit into it, just kind of to summarize your advice here, if you feel fear, which you may not recognize you feel, the advice is: do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do, right?

Matt Mochary (00:11:57):
Generally, I mean, check with someone. Don't just randomly, I feel fear crossing the street crossing a crowded highway and then go, oh, that's fear talking. I should cross the highway anyway and then get hit by a cop. No, that's not what I mean. I don't mean physical danger, I mean things that we perceive to be danger to our egos, but that the easiest thing is just to check with somebody else who's not in fear because they will be able to see clearly when you can't.

Lenny (00:12:24):
I was working through your curriculum and you pointed out that you found a way to express to somebody that they are in fear. I think it was your wife that kind of iterated on how to give you feedback that you're in fear where you didn't get defensive, you got more fearful and angry and can you talk a bit about that?

Matt Mochary (00:12:40):
Yeah, so we iterated, I at times feel anger and I act on that anger and I don't even realize I'm in anger, so I wanted her to let me know, and so she would say, at first she said, "You're in anger," and that just made me feel accused and made me go into more anger. And then she said, "Are you in anger?" And that felt passive aggressive or indirect and that also made me go into more anger. Then finally she said, "I perceive you to be an anger." So it's an I statement and it's simply what she's perceiving. There's no judgment. That was able to punch through my anger and then I woke up and went, oh, and then I stopped and just didn't act until I was able to shift out of anger.

Lenny (00:13:25):
Awesome. And anger and fear, I think there's different pieces of advice for if you feel angry versus fear. Is that right?

Matt Mochary (00:13:32):
Yes. I mean, anger, you're just destroying and what you're doing is you're destroying relationships and so you just got to stop because you're breaking glass. Of course, you're breaking it with the people who are closest to you. They're the people who are nearest to you, which are the people you love and care about the most. They're not only people you work with, but they're the people you live with and you don't want to do that. You don't want to hurt them.

Lenny (00:13:59):
Yeah. Maybe one last question along these lines, why do we do this? Is this just we're trying to protect our ego and ourselves and we just want to do the safe thing?

Matt Mochary (00:14:06):
That's it. I mean, I just learned very recently, and this isn't written anywhere because I just learned it, someone shared with me that anger is not a base emotion. Anger is actually a cover. It's a cover for when we feel pain, and so our brain doesn't want to feel the pain, so instead it externalizes it. But the problem is it shoves that pain onto everybody else around us. The real answer here is not to have people let us know that we're in anger and then stop. The real answer is just to allow ourselves to feel the pain and it sucks by the way, it actually hurts. But then we're not... Sorry, I'm getting emotional. We're not pushing that out onto other people and I only learned this very recently and I'm just starting to practice this and I'm still not good at it, but I'm now at least sometimes not going to anger.

Lenny (00:15:02):
It's interesting how personal this advice is that it sounds like something that you deal with. It's not just like you're this coach that's just like, hey guys, here's all these problems you have. Here's how you fix stuff that you help yourself with.

Matt Mochary (00:15:15):
I'm human. Yes, and that's why I try to figure it out with me and if I can figure something out with me, then I can share it with others.

Lenny (00:15:24):
Amazing. That was a fruitful question from Leo, and we might come back to this topic.

Matt Mochary (00:15:30):
By the way, this also applies to organizations. I mean, the way that I used to get all this information about how to run organizations is I started a company, Totality, and my co-founder and I, we did a terrible job running that company. What happened was I didn't have any learnings from that which I could share with people because it was just worst practices, not best practices. But then 10 years later, I thought to myself, well, how could I have done that better? How could we have done that better?

Matt Mochary (00:15:55):
So, I picked up a book, a business book, it was High Output Management by Andy Grove. I read it and I was like, "Oh my God, here are all the answers." And then I read another book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz was like, "Oh my God, there are even more answers." I just kept reading more and more business books, and every one I read, they were just chock full of answers. But then I needed to test whether or not these really worked, so that's when I started coaching and I started testing them in companies, but I had to let the people know here, do this, but they weren't going to read a 350 page book. I had to summarize it in two pages and then share it with them, and then they did, and then they implemented it and it worked.

Matt Mochary (00:16:29):
Then I had all these summaries, and then I started to create my own summaries of little niche cases that weren't in any book that I'd read. That's where all these writings came from. Then one day, someone that I was coaching said, "Matt, you got to take all these writings. They're a book, you got to publish them." And I said, "No, I don't." My friend said, "Well, how about I do all the work? How about I take care of the editing and the publishing?" And I was like, "Okay, if you want to do that, great." That was Alex MacCaw. Others had offered before, but he was the one that actually followed through all the way to the end. That was it. That's how the book was born.

Matt Mochary (00:17:06):
But I realized also, recently, that many of my most radical ideas, I can't get anyone to test them because I'll say, "Hey, I think you should do blank." And the CEO will say, "That sounds crazy. Matt, can you point me to other examples of other people that have done this and it's worked?" And I say, "No, this is an original thought that came out of my head. No one's done it before that I know of." They're like, "Okay, well I'm not going to be the first."

Matt Mochary (00:17:33):
Then I realized I needed an organization to test my most radical ideas, and also all of my CEOs had been asking me to create software because I have a methodology and it's step one, step two, step three, and you do it in one-on-ones and then a methodology for a team meeting and then a methodology for feedback and then a methodology for every different motion in the company. It's all in Google Docs. And they said to me, "Matt, this is amazing. I love this one-on-one process. I love your team process, but I don't want to have to teach each of my reports the way you've taught me. I'd like it just being softer. I just hit a button and boom, it happens automatically." At first, I said, "No, that's not interesting to me. I'm not a developer. You, Brian Armstrong, you're a developer and you have a thousand engineers that work for you. Why don't you go create it?"

Matt Mochary (00:18:21):
But in the end, I said, "Okay, this could be fun." So, I hired a team of developers and we started to create the software, and one, the product is working. But two more importantly, I now have a team of humans that we work together that I can start testing my more radical ideas out with. I would say about half of them are wildly successful and the other half complete duds. It almost seems like one are the other. But now I have my own basically laboratory to test things. Of course, when I see radical things that other people are doing, I try them in our organization, and it's phenomenal.

Matt Mochary (00:18:59):
I'll tell you the most radical one. I was asking one CEO, I said, "Have you ever let someone go and regretted it?" He said, "No." And I said, "Well, then you don't know what the bar is because the bar of where you should be letting people go is here, and the bar that you've let people go is here. So until you get close to that line, you don't know what that line is." He said, "Wow, that's true." Then I thought about it and I thought to myself, uh-oh, I have never let anyone go that I regret it, so I don't know where the line is.

Matt Mochary (00:19:34):
Then I thought, oh no, I've got to go into my team and let someone go, and here's the problem. We've already done talent density, we've already done the Netflix thing. If someone is meeting expectation, we let them go. We've already let all those folks go. So on our team, it's only outperformers. So, I thought there was one guy, he's an outperformer, no question about it, and super positive, an amazing guy and can do anything and is happy to do everything. But there wasn't much left for him to do because everything else was being covered. I talked to my number two and said, "Can you do what you're doing and what he's doing?" And she said, "Give me two weeks," and she did. She came back and said, "Yeah, I can." So, we let him go.

Matt Mochary (00:20:19):
Now, when I let someone go, I try to do it with a massive amount of compassion because I know it's brutal. I mean, losing your spouse, your home, and your job, these are the three most traumatic things that can happen to you. When that happens, of course you go into massive fear and the brain shuts down, so I want to be there and help them through that process and actively help them find their dream job because there is a place that absolutely needs them. So, what I do is I become their agent and I say, "I want to help you discover what it is that your ideal role is, and I want to help you create it or land it." I did that with him. Turns out, what he wanted to do was go start a company and create a new product so he could just start that day one. But, the litmus for me is that everybody I've let go, I believe anyway, that I continue to be friends with. That shows me that the process by which I let people go is a humane one.

Matt Mochary (00:21:17):
Here's the crazy thing, after letting this guy go, after about 30 days, I was like, ugh, did I do the wrong thing? Was that too much? But then after about two to three months, I realized, no, that actually was the right thing because my number two was able to absorb the things that he was doing and here's the crazy part, with fewer people in the organization, things work better. That's the big realization that most people never discover. they hit product market fit, they get tons of money from investors, just higher, higher, higher, higher, but every additional human you have in your organization causes extra overhead and geometrically so, because now you have to keep all those people informed, give them all context, make them all feel heard, because unless they feel like they're contributing and you understand what they're saying, then they feel ignored and they feel passed over and they feel disrespected and grumpy.

Matt Mochary (00:22:11):
There's this morale problem that exists. There's this friction of information flow and a morale problem that grows and grows and grows. Really, the only answer is, I mean, that's why people bring me in because they're growing, growing, growing, and things are breaking. I have a system that keeps things together, but it doesn't make it perfect. It just makes it so that the company doesn't fall apart. But really the ideal is just to keep the team super small. That's what WhatsApp did, that's what Instagram did, that's what Linear is doing right now. That's what Notion has been doing for a while. Those, to me, are the real success stories.

Lenny (00:22:53):
This reminds me of a story I just listened to on Lex Fridman's podcast. They were interviewing the head of AI at Tesla, or former head of AI, and Lex was asking him, "Why did you get rid of LiDAR on your cars? Like aren't more sensors good so that you can be better at self-driving?" And he's like, "If you have LiDAR, you got to think about the supply chain and getting all those parts. You got to think about all the additional data that it brings and adds more chaos to your data, and you have to think about that. Think about if that one part is gone, everything slows down, and in theory it is better, but then all these other factors end up making it worse." Talking about how Elon's philosophy is the best part is no part. It feels like that's exactly what you're saying.

Matt Mochary (00:23:36):
That's right.

Lenny (00:23:37):
You're getting to all the stuff I want to talk about, which is awesome. So firing people, this is good. We were chatting earlier and you mentioned that this is a skill that most managers are really bad at and maybe is the most important skill to develop as a leader and as a manager. People are just bad at it. You shared a few pieces of advice there, but is there anything else that you could share about just how to get better at firing people and that skill?

Matt Mochary (00:24:03):
Yeah, the reason people are bad at this is because they think that they're hurting the person who they're letting go. I mean, how many times have I heard from someone, "Yeah, this person's not performing, but gosh, they really need this job and their mother has cancer," and whatever personal situation they're in. Wei Deng, who is the CEO of Clipboard Health, who's one of my favorite CEOs, who frankly I learn more from her than she learns from me, she shared with me her framework for making decisions, which is she separates the decision from the implementation, meaning she thinks about who is the stakeholder here that I'm solving for? And almost always in a company, you're solving for the customer. So, what would the customer want to see happen? That's the decision. Of course, the customer would want to see only the best employees and anyone who isn't a great employee, don't be there.

Matt Mochary (00:24:52):
Now the implementation is, if I do this, if I let this person go, who gets hurt? Well, the employee gets hurt. Maybe I get hurt because it's a painful conversation. Maybe the rest of the team gets hurt because they're sad that their friend is leaving. Then you look at, well, what can we do? Each person who gets hurt, what is it that they really want? Let's see if we can help them get what they really want. Well, the person let go, what do they want? They want a great job where they're actually needed and they feel fulfilled, so they enjoy what they're doing and they're actually critical to the company or organization that they're with. Right now they're not, by the way, they're not critical, clearly. So you're actually holding them back from what it is that they really want.

Matt Mochary (00:25:36):
What you do is you help them find that place that really needs the skill or the passion that they have. Yourself, what do you really want? You want to not have a difficult conversation? Well, cognitive behavior therapy, the best way to get over that is to actually have one and realize it's not that bad. Then the rest of the team, they feel sad because their teammate left. Well, here's how you solve what they really want is they want to know that... They want to release their emotions. Okay, great. Listen to them, let them share their emotions, let them share the sadness that they feel, and then it's released out of their body.

Matt Mochary (00:26:12):
Decision is one thing, implementation is completely and utterly separate. That's the same thing here in letting someone go. But if you let them go kindly and humanely, the key is, in my opinion, you become their agent, like Michael Ovitz, the CAA agent. You help them find their next job actively. Michael Ovitz is the one who reaches out to employers for his clients and says, "Hey, do you have work for my client?" That's what I mean by being agent, not by, if you need a reference from me, I'll be happy to give you reference. That's bullshit, that's passive.

Matt Mochary (00:26:50):
I'm talking about active, and it doesn't take long. Maybe one to two hours of my time reaching out to people I know saying, "Hey, I've got this great person." Oh my God, of course they're going to pay attention. Of course, they're going to react. Now you might say, well, wait a second, what if the person isn't great? What if they're a bad performer and my posit is that they're good at something. You have to find out what it is they're good at. And really what they're good at is what they're passionate about, so find out what they're passionate about and that you can recommend them for. That's what I do.

Matt Mochary (00:27:25):
I think for almost all managers that aren't good at letting go, it's because A, they've never done it, or B, they've done it badly. They didn't help the person, and that person then went off and had a very painful time and now hates that manager. But if you actively help that person, they will appreciate it. Now, there are situations when a person says, "Screw you, I don't want your help." Okay, but they still recognize that you offered.

Lenny (00:27:56):
Who's the best person at firing that comes to mind when you think of this person's really good at this?

Matt Mochary (00:28:01):
Wei Deng from Clipboard Health. She's the most compassionate.

Lenny (00:28:07):
Awesome. The framework you shared reminds me of something my manager once taught me similarly. They missed the final piece of actually being their agent and finding their next gig, but just the idea of separate the emotion and doing the thing from, if there were no feelings involved, what would you do? And then you should do that, and that might be hard.

Matt Mochary (00:28:26):
That's exactly right. By the way, this whole thing about no feelings, I do have probably two CEOs that don't feel emotions. They don't feel fear, they don't feel anger. One, in particular, feels zero emotions. I have to say, he's a machine, he's an operating machine and there's zero time between ah, this is the right thing to do and doing it. It's amazing. It's an incredibly well run company and an incredibly valuable company. So yeah, emotions typically, again, typically fear and anger are the ones that derail our brains.

Lenny (00:29:08):
It makes me think of Alex Honnold, I think is his name, the free climber, the solo dude. His amygdala doesn't quite function so he doesn't-

Matt Mochary (00:29:19):
That's right.

Lenny (00:29:21):
That's interesting. He could be a free solo climber, he could be a CEO.

Matt Mochary (00:29:25):
That's right. CEO's a little safer. The prediction for Alex is that he will at some point, unfortunately die.

Lenny (00:29:33):
Yeah. Did you see The Alpinist? Not to spoil anything.

Matt Mochary (00:29:36):
Yes.

Lenny (00:29:38):
Okay, moving on from that, I'm curious, in a remote world, does your advice change in terms of firing? It seems like everything you shared you could do easily in person or remote, but does something change when you're doing it over Zoom?

Matt Mochary (00:29:51):
No, it doesn't change at all. There is one point I didn't include, which I'll include now, is there's helping the person be their agent, but there's also allowing the person, whenever I have a difficult conversation, I start it off, "Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this." What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard because if they're aware that they're going to go into fear, they're going to go into anger, they're going to go into sadness, then they can see it coming and they go, oh, that's what it is. But if they don't see it coming, just a surprise and all of a sudden it grips their whole brain and now they're in it and they don't even know they're in it.

Matt Mochary (00:30:43):
That's the first thing I do. This is going to be a difficult conversation. Are you ready? Then I share the news. I'm letting you go, here's why. Then second, I deliver the message. The third thing is now they're feeling emotions, strong ones. Even though I warned them, they're still feeling them. Now you want them to be able to release those emotions, and so I say to them, "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" Sometimes they don't answer, but many times they do and they share with me and they let it out. That's important to allow them to let it out. Then I make them feel heard and I actively listen. That makes them realize that I'm not trying to run away from the pain that they're feeling. I'm not trying to leave them alone with it. I sit with them as they have it and then I try to help them get through it.

Lenny (00:31:47):
That's something else I wanted to chat about is the feeling heard lesson that you have for people. I'd love to just get your advice on just how to help people feel heard. It's like, oh yeah, I know that's important. I want people to feel heard. I will listen and it'll go great. But you have some very tactical advice on how to actually make people feel heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:05):
Yeah, there's sort of a few different levels of it. One way to make people feel heard is, let's assume you're talking to them because there's another way, there's an even more surface way is verbal. Sometimes what I do is I ask, if I'm in a group of people, and there's a question or a problem that we're trying to solve, instead of going around the room and hearing people's verbal opinions, which takes forever, I ask everyone at the same time to take five minutes to write down their solution. Then we all drop it in a doc and then I just read it. When I read it I say, "Thank you, Lenny." And that makes you know that I at least read it, so that's a little bit of feeling heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:40):
Second, if I want to make you feel more heard, I ask you to say it verbally and then I repeat it back to you. "Lenny, I think what I heard you say is... Is that right?" And you're like, "Yes." Or you're like, "No, not quite a little bit different." Then if it's a little bit different, I repeat it again until you say, "Yes, that's it." Now you know that I understood you.

Matt Mochary (00:33:00):
Then there's a third way which is even deeper, which is especially if you're giving me feedback, you likely don't want to hurt my feelings. So what you're doing is you're giving me the feedback, but you're couching it, you're polishing it, you're rounding the edges, you're making it softer. It's not really what you're thinking, but it's what you're willing to say. If I want to make you really feel heard, I reflect back what I imagine are the thoughts in your head. If I think you're feeling anger, I sort of think to myself, well, what would anger feel like? I cause myself to feel that anger, then what are the thoughts that appear to me? I say something to you like, "Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're off and you're thinking, screw you, Matt. How dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me? Is that close?" And you're like, "No, Matt."

Matt Mochary (00:33:49):
People either say one of two things, they say, "Yeah, that is it." Or they say "No, that's stronger than what I was thinking, but directionally that's right." What that really means is, yeah, that's what I was thinking. Almost always their thoughts are bigger than their words, but they really feel heard when I share their thoughts. Now, that's not the end of the process. I mean you actually have to then do something. Once you made them feel heard, you have to say, okay, well either I accept or don't accept this feedback and if I accept, here's what I'm going to do about it. If I don't accept, I need to explain to you why. Here's what's going on. You shared with me what's going on in your world, now let me share with you what's going on in my world. Hopefully, you can see why this thing that's going on in my world doesn't allow me to accept what it is that you shared, and hopefully now that you see what's going on in my world, your feedback changes and that's it. That's the whole process.

Lenny (00:34:45):
I'm listening to this advice and I'm like, yes, I will do this next time I'm talking to someone. I imagine people don't and they forget, and it takes time to actually learn these things. Like the firing advice you just shared, how do you actually get good at this and practice these things is like I have to work with a coach who will continue to reinforce these things? Is it follow these steps next time? Have them written down? What advice do you have for folks that are like, I want to get better at this. I want to start doing this stuff.

Matt Mochary (00:35:09):
Well, these docs are all free to the public in the curriculum. You can post them here, you can post them on Twitter, you can post the whole curriculum on Twitter, frankly, other people have. It has a step-by-step. There's a doc in there that is a step-by-step script. All you do is you read it and you follow the script in letting someone go or in making someone feel heard. My posit is once you do it one time, you're like, oh my god, that worked so well. That's the only motivation you need. And you've got the script, so you can just keep doing it. I don't think you need a coach.

Matt Mochary (00:35:42):
In fact, I remember one time I asked an investor who their best up and coming CEO was. The investor gave me a name. I was like, "Great, can I please get introduced to him? I want coach him." I reached out, the guy responded immediately. He's like, "Matt, I've read your book. I love your book. I read it three years ago. I've been implementing all the elements in our company. It's fantastic." When someone says that they know my work, they've already implemented it and it's worked, 10 out of 10 times, that person wants me to coach them. Then I said, "Great, that's fantastic. I'd love to coach you." And the guy said to me, "No, thanks." I was shocked. I was like, "Why?" He said, "Well, because it's all working. I don't have any problems. I don't think I need to be coached by you." I couldn't have heard a better answer. That, to me, is the ultimate answer. And he is right. He doesn't need me, doesn't need anyone.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I was going to ask if that's the goal of all of this writing down and systemizing is just to make yourself unnecessary.

Matt Mochary (00:36:45):
Totally.

Lenny (00:36:48):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.

Lenny (00:37:22):
If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

That actually reminds me of another question a reader asked on Twitter who happened to be the one on only Ryan Hoover. He asked, "How has your approach changed in your coaching since you started?"

Matt Mochary (00:38:16):
Ryan obviously started Product Hunt and then he sold the company to AngelList, so he was part of AngelList when I went there because I was coaching Naval. What we realized coaching Naval is that Naval did not want to be CEO and he just didn't know how to get out. So, I said there's a way and I can show you, and so I did and made Naval's life 10 times better. Frankly, made AngelList 10 times better because Naval wasn't enjoying being CEO, therefore he wasn't good at it. We ended up putting someone in who did a fine job, then put someone else in who's doing an insanely good job. Now, of course, AngelList is massively valuable.

Matt Mochary (00:38:53):
Ryan was there at the time, Ryan Hoover, great guy, I love Ryan. So, what has changed since then? I think what's changed is I don't think back then I had any of this fear and anger give bad advice. I think back then it was all very tactical. It was all very high up management type stuff, which is you need to have goals and at the company level, at the department level, at the individual level, you then need to track those goals. You need to track all the agreements that people make, all the actions they say they'll do. You have to put it all in Asana. Everyone has to be able to see each other's Asana board so they can see what each other is doing. I still do that, but now I've added on this piece of oh, you're in the moment and you're feeling fear? Okay, you still got to go forward. That's sort of the big change.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I noticed that's at the top of the curriculum. Do you find that's where a lot of the biggest transformations happen, that curriculum component?

Matt Mochary (00:39:49):
Absolutely. I cause people when they first start coaching, they have to read that first. There's sort of three seminal documents: on time, top goal, and fear and anger give bad advice. On time just says, hey, we're going to start our meetings on time and you're going to show up and if you don't show up on time, you're going to let me know first. That's just because I don't want to... And by the way, I showed up two minutes late for us. That's because I was on the Google Hangout for 10 minutes. I didn't realize, I thought you were-

Lenny (00:40:21):
I'm trying to fix that bug. Every time we send an invite, there's a Google meet button there. I think I cracked it finally. Yeah, that would've been a funny podcast where I'm just sitting here starting on time and for two minutes. Hello, we're just waiting.

Matt Mochary (00:40:33):
Exactly. Second one is top goal, which is this concept from McKeown, who wrote Essentialism, which is everyone is making requests of you, but if all you do is spend all day is responding to other people's requests, you never actually march towards your own priorities. You need to A, create priorities and then set aside some amount of time each day, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours that you just work on your own priority. If you do that, you'll make massive gains. And that's true. I mean, in five minutes I can change someone's life just by having them follow that practice. Then the third one is, if you're in anger, give that advice and that's what I have people read and say, "Does this resonate with you?" If it does, we can work together and if it doesn't, we shouldn't work together. So yeah, that's kind of like the crux document of whether or not people philosophically are going to resonate with what I have to share.

Lenny (00:41:25):
The top goal piece, I'm reading a book called Make Time right now and that's a big part of it. I actually just added top goal to my calendar every day. It's not working yet. Every time I get to it, I'm like no, I'm going to just check Twitter right now. But I'm working on it.

Matt Mochary (00:41:38):
That is the hardest part. Now, what I've done is I'm similar. During my top goal time, I have somebody sit with me and they prevent me from doing anything but my top goal.

Lenny (00:41:51):
Wait, can you talk a bit more about that? Is this like a coworker? Are you just like, "I need you here for this hour every day?"

Matt Mochary (00:41:56):
Yeah, I mean it's like the same idea as a trainer in a gym. A trainer in a gym, maybe they're teaching you a little bit, but more often than not they're just forcing you to do the thing that you know need to do. But if they weren't there, you would kind of go eh and not do it. That's all this is. It's what I call an accountability partner.

Matt Mochary (00:42:15):
There's even an app now where you can go online and you can sign up and I think it costs like $5 a month and you can sign up to meet someone else and you become accountability partners to each other. It's insanely effective. I'm not the only one that has a problem focusing on tasks that I don't love that are necessary, but I don't love. Like a meeting, I could take a meeting, I could take 20 meetings, I could take 10 hours of meetings, no problem. Especially when I'm the presenter, when I'm the active one. But doing asynchronous tasks for me because so people-oriented that when there isn't another human with me, it's painful, so I just have another human with me.

Lenny (00:43:04):
I love that. And that person is doing other work, I imagine they're not just watching you full-time.

Matt Mochary (00:43:09):
No, they can do whatever they want.

Lenny (00:43:12):
Is this what you recommend to leaders and CEOs? Just have someone there for an hour. Wow.

Matt Mochary (00:43:18):
If your personality is like mine, yes, have someone there. It can be remote, it can be in person, it doesn't matter. In person's a little bit more effective.

Lenny (00:43:27):
Right, there's like a little zoom window.

Matt Mochary (00:43:28):
I have my kids do it. They love it.

Lenny (00:43:32):
I love that. There's an app I use called Centered, that app that I'm an investor in, but I use it all the time and they have this buddy feature actually where you can be paired with a buddy in real time.

Matt Mochary (00:43:40):
Yes, yes.

Lenny (00:43:42):
To close a loop on the firing piece, something I was thinking about while you were talking is there's a lot of layoffs happening right now. When you're letting go of like a thousand people, you can't really be their agent unless you've seen that happen. Do you have any advice for just like there's a large layoff how you could do this?

Matt Mochary (00:43:58):
Absolutely you can be their agent, not you personally, but they each have a manager and the manager usually has 12 reports and they're rarely letting go more than 50% at a time. That means six people that they've got to be the agent of maximum. Yes, each manager can be the agent for six people. My companies have done a lot of layoffs and here's why. Back in March of 2020, there was a chance that the world economy was imploding. Now of course, by April and May we realized that wasn't the case, that the tech world kept going, in fact, it was even flourishing.

Matt Mochary (00:44:38):
But in March of 2020, we didn't know that. And so you needed, if you were being fiscally responsible, you needed to prepare for that eventuality, so you needed pare costs. 80% of costs in any tech company is payroll, is humans. If you're going to pare costs, you actually have to let go of humans. Almost every one of my companies did. Some on the low side of 5%, some on the high side. One company that is a hotel company let go of 40% because it looked like their business was about to get obliterated and the results were crazy. Within 60 days of each layoff, the CEO reported back to me: It's insane. I don't know how this happened, but the company's now operating better. I'm not talking on a relative scale, I'm talking on an absolute scale. We're putting out more features, more code. Our NPS is up, whatever it is, whatever department is performing better. The only answer for it was we've got less people, so this coordination issue is reduced.

Matt Mochary (00:45:49):
Then now in May, June of this year, we had this huge reset of valuations where growth tech stocks dropped by 50 to 90% value and all of a sudden, which we're still in and we don't know how long this can last, it's all based on interest rates so it's likely that growth stocks will be at these valuations until interest rates come back down again, which could be two to three years. These companies now they can go raise money, but it's going to be at a big down round and down rounds are very painful. So now these companies have to make sure that they don't need to raise money in the next three years. They've got to conserve cash once again.

Matt Mochary (00:46:33):
Here we are, we're in the land of layoffs again, but this time it's different. This time these CEOs know that the company actually gets better. And the CEOs that have never done this before, I simply connect them with the CEOs who have done this before and then they get convinced like, oh man, my company will be better. And now this time, people have been even more aggressive. We've had companies that have laid off 50% of the company and the results have been frankly, phenomenal.

Matt Mochary (00:47:02):
But the key to doing it well is there has to be a humane delivery. The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You didn't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. Of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. That's the most important thing.

Matt Mochary (00:48:17):
The second thing is then later, so tactically, this is how it happens. You have an inner circle. I think that inner circle should include all managers in the company and you say, this is how much we need to let go. Here's how much each of you needs to let go. First of all, you don't say to each department head or team leader, manager, tell me who you can let go because they'll all say nobody. You actually have to give them numbers. You have to let this dollar amount go or this many people go, dollar amount is better because if you say people, then they'll just let go of the cheapest people, the most junior, and often the most junior are the ones that are actually doing the most work. You want it to be dollars because that's actually really what you're trying to save. You're trying to save dollars.

Matt Mochary (00:49:07):
So, you say you have to save this many dollars, come up with a number, they quickly come back with a number. You don't want to have department heads choose for managers because if you have a team lead and all of a sudden they're told to let go these three people, the team lead will go, that was crazy. Those are my three best people. So you want to let each manager choose and that doesn't need to take long. That could take 48 hours.

Matt Mochary (00:49:29):
Then you move to implementation. At implementation, you spend the morning and have each manager reach out to people and just Slack them say, "Hey, can I talk to you for 15 minutes?" And then they have these meetings back-to-back-to-back or as close as they can and they deliver the news, the difficult conversation that we talked about before. "It's going to be a difficult conversation. I'm letting you go. I imagine this feels crappy or feels like worse than that. This is horrible. If you're willing to share your feelings and I want to be your agent now. I don't have time to do it now, but I'd like to schedule with you another hour tomorrow, the next day whenever, so that we can go and dig in and I can help be your agent."

Matt Mochary (00:50:12):
Then, that takes the morning. By the afternoon, you've scheduled an all hands for the stay team. With the stay team, you'd tell them what had just occurred and you answer their questions. The questions are almost always around fear. Like, "Holy shit, is this going to happen to me? Did these people even get feedback that they weren't performing? Does this mean that we're dying as a company and that we're going to implode?" You have to address each one of these questions and hopefully the answer is: no, to the first one, is this going to happen to me? No, this isn't. We cut deep so that we only cut once. The people to your left and right and you, you are the state team. This is the team that we're going to building the company with going forward. It's important to be able to say that. You actually want to cut deep because cutting two times or three times creates PTSD in an organization. It's trauma one, trauma two, trauma three. Now they're like, ah, it's just going to keep happening.

Matt Mochary (00:51:10):
Then, the third piece is, and this not everybody does, if you don't do this, your company within 60 days will be performing better. If you do this, your company within two weeks will be performing better because people now, the stay team, they feel sadness, they feel anger, they feel fear. Yes, you addressed their questions in the all hands, but not fully because some people didn't even talk in the all hands.

Matt Mochary (00:51:34):
So, what you do is with each and every person on the stay team, you have a one-on-one with their manager for one hour and all the manager does is say, "I'd like to know your thoughts and feelings," and the person shares and then all the manager does is make them feel heard. I think what you're telling me is you feel sad because your three buddies are now no longer here and you feel anger because you think this is bullshit and you think why did we hire this many people if we're going to fire them? That was just irresponsible. You feel fear because you're not sure if the company's going to implode or if your job is safe. Is that right? And they're like, "Yes."

Matt Mochary (00:52:11):
It doesn't take away the emotion entirely, but it knocks it down by a good 25%, which is enough that the person won't do something rash, they won't quit, they won't stop working, they won't say bad shit to other people, and it allows them to accelerates their recovery. Within two weeks, they're now seeing how the company's operating better and morale then comes up and the company's now performing better than it was before. So, three elements.

Lenny (00:52:44):
That was thousands of dollars of advice I think, in just five to 10 minutes.

Matt Mochary (00:52:50):
That's after having probably gone through this with CEOs maybe 40 times and iterating AB testing, and what's the difference, and what works well, and what didn't work well. Yeah, I can't imagine there's somewhat out there who has advised more people through a layoff process, certainly in the tech world, than I have. I'm not saying I'm proud of that, but it just is.

Lenny (00:53:17):
What a fun place to be. As you were talking, I was thinking a little bit about Twitter and Elon and the experience that's going through right now. It feels like on the one hand, he's letting go of a lot of people, which matches kind of your advice. On the other hand, not being handled too well. I think it's emails and just a lot of random quick things. What's your perspective on this whole thing?

Matt Mochary (00:53:39):
I haven't been following it directly, so I don't know how he's implementing the layoffs or how much he's doing. Frankly, just haven't been following it at all. But here's the sad reality, even if it's handled incredibly poorly, the company ends up performing better. It just takes a little longer for people to recover, for the stay team to recover emotionally. But the worst case scenario, it's handled terribly, within two months, the company will be performing better.

Lenny (00:54:09):
Fascinating. That's actually a good segue to this last topic I wanted to touch on, which something that I think you have a lot of thoughts on is building new products within a larger company and innovating inside of a larger kind of scaled company, and especially the challenges around that. What are your thoughts on just how to do this well, how to innovate within a larger company?

Matt Mochary (00:54:30):
I can tell you the short version, but I'll tell you the long version. The long version is that this was a real problem for everyone I was coaching and I didn't know the answer. But it was obvious that YC startups were crushing and just iterating so much faster. And then I had the thought, well, why not just create your own YC startup and have it crush you but you own it? It, of course, has to really look like a YC startup. It has to have a founder mentality person as the head of the team, someone who's willing to just break glass and just won't stop until they run through the brick wall. It's actually pretty easy to find founder mentality folks. You just literally go to the YC alumni list and the ones whose startups failed, perfect, they're available and they are founder types and now they want to join a company that's actually succeeding because they realize how hard it is to create something on their own, but they still have the mentality.

Matt Mochary (00:55:24):
Then you want to keep the team really small because then they can, again, there's no buy-in required, like everyone's on the same page with the same information. We started testing that and it worked, and then I thought, well wait a second. The reason that a big company has a hard time innovating, it's because once a product is scaled, it's now got millions of users. So you have two things that you need to make sure stay true every day: the site is up and running and there's no security breach. Every time you add code, you've got to test it thoroughly to make sure it doesn't take down either one of those. The review process is insane.

Matt Mochary (00:56:06):
So now you're innovating, you're writing prototype code on new features. You can't get it approved it takes so long. That's what you're trying to decouple and you're trying to create an entity that isn't touching the core code, but you also don't want to have to go through the approval process of the product team or the head of product. That takes way too long, as well. That's why it has to be a small team that reports to outside of EPD. It can't report to the head of engineering, head of product, head of design, it can't. It's got to go outside, usually directly to the CEO. That's the only other place to report that's outside.

Matt Mochary (00:56:48):
Then I had this idea, well wait a second, there's also a brand question and so why don't you create an entirely new name for this product that isn't the core, the base business? Why don't you actually just create its own C corp? Why don't you make it so clear that this is its own entity? So I wrote this whole thing up and created its own C corp. I shared this with a few people and one CEO said to me, "Matt, this sounds radical and sounds like it could work, but is anyone actually doing this?" I thought to myself, oh shit, no, nobody's actually doing this. Nobody that I know has created new C Corps for the entities, the new products they're developing.

Matt Mochary (00:57:34):
Then 30 days later, I got in a call with Wei Deng. I told you before, I'm a huge fan, and we talked about product and I shared with her this write up. She's like, "Oh yeah, that's what I do." She said, "I created five C Corps in the last two months." I was like, "What? Someone's actually doing it." I was like, "Well, what are the results?" She's like, "They're fantastic." She goes, "The team doesn't worry about trying shit because they know that it doesn't hurt our core brand, and so they're iterating fast." And she said, "Not only do I do that, I actually have two teams, independent, working on each new product. One I have is more engineering focused, they build custom code. The other is more sort of customer relationship-focused and maybe they don't even have engineers and they build a manual solution or they use off the shelf products to build a solution, and just see which one makes more progress faster." Wow, insane. That's why, again, I have so much respect for Wei.

Lenny (00:58:36):
When I think about these ideas, I think of the NPE team at Facebook and I think it's called Area 21 at Google, which works on new ideas and I don't know if anything amazing has come out of those groups maybe, I don't know. But it feels like the missing piece, and you didn't mention this piece, is feeling like there's a huge upside if you get something. Like founders having equity of their company feels like such a motivator. I could become a billionaire if this works out, versus I'm helping my startup in some small incremental way. Is that an important piece or do you think it's not critical?

Matt Mochary (00:59:09):
I'm going to be radical here. I don't think it matters at all. I think that what really motivates people is building shit that gets used in the world. I think people will say, and they'll fight for equity and money, but in the end, that's not what actually motivates them. Because I've seen this work in companies where they don't have big equity, but they have autonomy, they have ownership, not equity ownership, ownership over decision making, ownership over creation. That's what I think people want. Amazon does this. They're not giving their people... Amazon's famous for being cheap bastards, but someone has a great idea, okay, here's 5 million bucks, go do. Amazon is definitely innovating successfully.

Lenny (01:00:02):
What about the flip side of that of not necessarily the huge upside, but the I'm staking everything on this startup, I need this to work, this is my thing, my name's on the line. I feel like that's a big motivator also for founders, like I'm not going to give up this feeling of grit. Is that important?

Matt Mochary (01:00:21):
Yeah, it's also fear. It's fear, which is like if this doesn't work, I'm screwed. Fear, frankly, is an excellent motivator. It gets people to move fast and move hard. The only problem with fear is it's also corrosive, so it eats out my insides as I go along. It makes it that I don't enjoy life, but it's highly motivated. Now, I think joy is actually even more motivating or they say it's as motivating, but it's noncorrosive, so I can last much longer if I'm doing something for joy. Fear is short term, extreme motivation. It's adrenaline. Joy is long term, consistent motivation that also allows me to look back on my life and go, wow, that was a great life. So yes, that is effective motivation, but I don't recommend putting oneself in that position to get motivated.

Lenny (01:01:14):
For companies that want to try this method that you're describing, is there a curriculum document for this approach out there?

Matt Mochary (01:01:21):
There is.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Okay, we'll link to that. Are there any other companies that are doing this well that come to mind? You mentioned Amazon, Clipboard Health.

Matt Mochary (01:01:29):
In my portfolio, I know Scale and Attentive Mobile are both doing this well. More and more companies that I coach are starting to do this because I have more and more examples of it working well, so more and more companies are then copying. I don't have other names offhand that I can share though.

Lenny (01:01:43):
What was that first company? Scale?

Matt Mochary (01:01:45):
Scale.

Lenny (01:01:46):
Cool. Is that Scale AI?

Matt Mochary (01:01:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Okay, cool. I love that. Love that founder. Maybe a last question, something that I noted just in case we had a little more time is around energy audit. This is something that you advise folks to understand what gives them energy, what zaps their energy, can you talk a bit about that?

Matt Mochary (01:02:06):
Sure. It turns out that what we're really good at is what we love and what we love is often space and time disappear when we do it. Therefore, we actually probably don't even value it because it comes so easily to us that we don't ascribe value. Whereas things that we don't love but we're good at, we often ascribe value there and other people want us to do those things because they're often creating value for the whole team or the family or the group.

Matt Mochary (01:02:39):
There are four zones I posit and I learned this from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group. I don't know where she learned it from, but almost everything that I have, I poached from somebody, but at least I tell you where I poached it from. The concept is you have four zones.

Matt Mochary (01:02:58):
Zone one is your incompetence, you're not good at it, someone's better at it than you. That's like fixing a car. You should let someone else do that.

Matt Mochary (01:03:07):
Second is your zone of competence, you're fine, you can do it fine. But so can somebody else do it fine. Like cleaning your house. Yes, you could do it, but it would take a lot of time and you're not creating that much value. You should let someone else do that.

Matt Mochary (01:03:22):
Third zone, your zone of excellence. This is something that you're uniquely good at, but you don't love it. This is the danger zone. This is likely what you're getting paid for and you're likely to getting paid a lot of money for it. Other people want you to do it. You are creating value, but it's also sucking the life force out of you and it doesn't allow you to become amazing and create massive value.

Matt Mochary (01:03:45):
Then there's your zone of genius. This is the thing you do that's uniquely good in the world and you don't even notice that you're doing it because you love it so much. The key is to go and look at your day. How do you move into the zone of genius? It's not that you figure out what it is and do more of that, it's that you figure out what it isn't and eliminate that and then naturally, you'll be drawn toward what it is that you love.

Matt Mochary (01:04:10):
What I do with the energy audit is you go through a calendar, two weeks of a calendar, a representative two weeks and you first look at all the meetings you have, but then you fill in there's time in between meetings. What were you actually doing? Take your best guess, write it in and then hour by hour, take a green marker and a red marker and each hour from Monday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM and the same thing each day for two weeks, each hour ask yourself at the end of that hour, did I have more energy or less energy?

Matt Mochary (01:04:41):
If it's more energy, you mark it green. If it's neutral or negative, you mark it red. Then, once you've done that for two weeks, you look at all the reds and say what's with the themes here? Oh, one on ones with people who are no longer by direct reports, team meetings where nothing was prepared in advance and everything was verbal. Recruiting meetings, interviews with people that we didn't end up hiring. Informational interviews from people that wanted to meet me and just know me but provide no value to me. These are all things that are energy draining.

Matt Mochary (01:05:14):
Great. Now what you do is you go through each one of them and say, one, do I need to do this at all? Does it need to be done? If the answer is no, just cancel it. Two, it needs to be done, but someone else can do it. Great, delegate it to them. Three, and this is the most common, it needs to be done and only I can do it. Great, then the question is, what would make it exquisite? Well, it's the exec team meeting. I'm the CEO, I have to be in it. Well, what would make it exquisite?

Matt Mochary (01:05:41):
You know what would be exquisite? It would be exquisite if everyone pre-prepared their update, which said how they're doing against their priorities, regular green, what they did last week, what they're going to do this week, and then they pre-route any problems they saw in the company and any proposed solution they had for those problems. If everyone did that, then we could spend the first 15 minutes of the meeting just reading, processing the decisions and we could take a three hour meeting down to a 45 minute meeting. Great, go write that up, share it with a group and say, hey gang, this is what would make this meaning exquisite for me. What do you guys think?

Matt Mochary (01:06:18):
Nine out of 10 times people look at it and go, yeah, that would be amazing because they're feeling the same way. Then you go with a new methodology and it turns out to be great. That's how you take what you do each day from a lot of energy draining things into open space or energy raising things which will then allow you to start doing more and more of the things that you love. You keep doing this energy audit repeatedly, 1, 2, 3 times until your calendar is 80% green. Once that happens, magic will occur. All of a sudden, your life will become phenomenal and you will start to create massive value. I did it. That's what happened to me.

Lenny (01:07:05):
I did that too actually, a simpler version where I just paid attention to what gave me energy and what didn't give me energy when I was on this journey post Airbnb and I thought I was wanted to start a company, I thought I wanted to do some advising and consulting and I realized none of that gives me energy, but writing interesting things that people like, that was fun. So I just kind of doubled down on that path and had no idea was going to make any money and it ended up making money and that's what I do now. So yeah, two thumbs up for this method and it's a more sophisticated version, which I like.

Matt Mochary (01:07:36):
Right on. That's also trusting that there will be, if you need to monetize, eventually you will be able to monetize, but you got to start with doing the thing you love first.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Right. Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of people on Twitter and newsletters that are just doing it because they think this is something they will enjoy and other people are doing it. But I find that with this content life, you get on this treadmill where you have to continue producing things and if you don't actually enjoy it and it's not interesting to you, you end up just building this job for yourself that is no fun at all. Extra important if you're kind of going down this path.

Lenny (01:08:19):
One quick question I had along these lines is you're talking about how you focus on yourself and your energy and what works for you or not. And I was like, do these collide with other people on your team because they maybe get energy from something you don't? But your point is that oftentimes, everyone's like, "Yes, this is good for me too. We should do this because it's going to help everybody feel better."

Matt Mochary (01:08:38):
That's exactly right. I remember one time we did this energy audit process, I did it with Henrique and Pedro from Brex and it was revolutionary for them. It caused them to change how the two of them operated together. They realized one really enjoyed the internal meetings and the other really enjoyed the external meetings, so well great, let's just do that. It changed the trajectory of the company so much so that they said, "Matt, would you please come in and do this energy audit with all of our managers?" And we did. We did a big group thing and what they found was that process also changes the trajectory of the company because for everything that you don't enjoy but needs to get done, there's someone out there that loves to do it. You just got to find out who it is, and that's what happened.

Lenny (01:09:28):
I was just talking to my mom who's a CPA and I'm like, "Do you even enjoy this job you're doing?" She's like, "I love it. I love doing taxes. It's so interesting." I'm like, I'm so happy somebody out there enjoys this. I would pay anything for someone to take this off my plate. You can charge me. Because my mom does my taxes.

Matt Mochary (01:09:44):
That's exactly right.

Lenny (01:09:45):
Matt, any final thoughts you want to share before we wrap up?

Matt Mochary (01:09:49):
This was fun. Thanks, Lenny. I appreciate this.

Lenny (01:09:52):
Super fun. I feel like a sign of a great conversation is it feels like we've been talking for maybe five minutes, but also a lifetime. Maybe we'll do this again. There's like a million other questions I'd love to get into, but until then, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?

Matt Mochary (01:10:07):
Where can people find me? I don't know. Don't find me. I won't be able to respond. I get too many inbounds and I can't respond to them. In terms of people helpful to me, just read the content and use it and don't pay me to coach you. Just do it on your own because you don't need to pay me to coach you.

Lenny (01:10:28):
I love that. It's the first time someone's like, "Do not reach out. I got it all for you online." We'll link to the show notes of the doc and everything. Matt, thank you. This was incredible.

Matt Mochary (01:10:39):
Thank you, Lenny. This was great. Take care.

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
If you're really open and open source, sometimes you have to stand up the bullies and you have to fight to protect your open source ideals.

Speaker 1 (00:00:05):
Please put your hands together for Matt Mullenweg.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
Matt Mullenweg has been making some questionable moves recently. There's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days. 20+ years of good sentiment burned in days. You are like a 100% beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this, a lot of people don't like you.

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:23):
If you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years. Previously, 1% of the world thought I was terrible and now I feel like it's up to four or 5%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
People that don't know what the hell's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:39):
There's a company called WP Engine. By 2018, they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. Since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit. They started using the trademark, they're offering something called WordPress. They're referred to it as like a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):
Why do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy?

Matt Mullenweg (00:00:58):
A lie gets around the world seven times before the truth has time to get out of bed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today my guest is Matt Mullenweg. Matt is the co-creator of WordPress, which powers 40% of websites on the internet today, including whitehouse.gov. He's also the CEO of Automatic, which is valued at over $7 billion and owns products like WordPress.com, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Gravatar, and Pocket Casts. There is a lot of drama these days around Matt and WordPress and within the open source community, so I thought I'd have Matt on to address many of the criticisms head-on that he hasn't addressed in other places and also just get the full story on what's going on. We also chat about what incepted him to spend over half his life at this point on open source and creating WordPress. Also, why products like Llama are what he calls 'fake open source' and his perspective on AI and open source. Also, how AI is actually trained on open source code and what that means for the future and his approach for deciding what companies to acquire within Automatic.

(00:02:24):
This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more, that's workos.com.

(00:03:42):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.

Christina Cacioppo (00:03:51):
Great to be here, big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:54):
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:01):
Sure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today we currently help over 9,000 companies including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):
That is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.

Christina Cacioppo (00:04:39):
That is very much our experience before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):
We appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get $1000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.

Christina Cacioppo (00:05:10):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Mullenweg (00:05:17):
Thanks, big fan and long time listener, so happy to be on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):
I'm a long time fan. I've been wanting to get you on this podcast for so long and this is such an interesting time to be chatting with you, there's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days, so it's really interesting, almost good that we waited a little bit to talk so we're going to get into a lot of that stuff. But I want to start with just what is it that you do, Matt? What are all the things you're involved in? Give people a sense of just the things you're working on.

Matt Mullenweg (00:05:44):
So first, when I was 19, I co-founded an open source project called WordPress with Mike Little and we started just blogging software, then became sort of a full site thing and then became a platform that really tons of stuff is built on and now it's kind of transitioning into this cool WASM can be embedded anywhere or run locally or make mobile apps. It's really interesting seeing WordPress used as an engine for powering things I would say don't even look like a website, which is kind of wild to me, but that's kind of the beauty of the open source people do things with that you don't expect. End up dropping out of college, moving to San Francisco and then worked at CNET for a year as project manager actually, that's how they hired me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):
I want to talk about that, but go on.

Matt Mullenweg (00:06:30):
And then had this vision where instead of downloading the software and setting up a database and everything, we made a SaaS version of WordPress. I pitched it at CNET, they didn't want to do it, so I was like, "Okay, I got to do this," so I left and started a company called Automatic. And the idea was to essentially compliment the core WordPress software with some commercial services, things that run in the cloud, like Akismet which is our machine learning AI, I guess you'd call it AI now, but anti-spam system, or Jetpack, which is iCloud for WordPress. It does the backups and the real time sync and everything like that.

(00:07:04):
So that was 19 years ago, so that's now grown to be over 1700 people in actually 90 countries so we've actually been fully distributed and remote and asynchronous from the start, which I think is one of our superpowers. I actually wasn't the CEO in the beginning, but in 2014, so I guess 11 years ago, I became CEO. The original CEO was... Well, I guess I wasn't the very beginning, but then I hired Tony Schneider from BCL, probably four or five months in.

(00:07:35):
And yeah, so that is a very full-time thing and Automatic does a lot of products, WooCommerce, which is open source Shopify, which is now half our revenue. And then we have some really cool apps so like Beeper, DayOne, Simplenote, Rocket Casts or trying to fill up your home screens with open web, open source things that are very privacy and user-centric. So running that company is definitely a full-time job. I still run WordPress.org and the WordPress project, so I'm the lead developer there and so sort of manage all those releases in the community and the directories and all the sort of things we do on WordPress.org and this cool thing called Openverse we took over Creative Commons, which is a way you can find sort open licensed images and audio and video. So basically if you notice a throughput through all these things, it's open source.

(00:08:31):
On the nights and weekends or side, a few hours a week I do some angel investing. So I've done over 100 angel investments through an entity called Audrey Capital, which is sort of, if anything's in the sort of WordPress space, I invest in it through Automatic, but if anything's a little more further afield I do it through Audrey Capital and have done some really exciting investments there, everything from name brands like Stripe and SpaceX, but also it was in the seat of Calm or a lot of home automation stuff like Ring, August, smart things. Yeah, just check out Audrey Capital, it's got some fun stuff in there. Daylight Computer, which is one I'm very excited about right now.

(00:09:11):
And I guess finally I love San Francisco, so I an a co-owner of a cool grungy jazz club in North Beach called Keys with Simon Rowe. So if Wednesday through Saturday night, you want to see some awesome live jazz, check out Keys.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:28):
Wow, okay. You said too much, I get it now. Jazz club I was not aware of, I got to check this out. It's called Keys?

Matt Mullenweg (00:09:36):
Yeah, keys Jazz Bistro.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
Okay, cool.

Matt Mullenweg (00:09:39):
It's over on Broadway in Columbus, kind of right around there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):
Amazing. That was news to me. Going back to Automatic, I think people don't get the scale of this thing, so just to mirror back, if you think that even add to what you've said, 1700 people work there, 90 different countries. Also, you didn't share this stat, it was something like 43% of internet websites are built on WordPress, run on WordPress.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:02):
Yeah, so when we started, a lot of websites were built on custom CMSs and there's a lot of fragmentation in the space, but now WordPress has grown to be over 40% of all websites in the world, which is 10x the number two, which right now is Shopify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):
Right, they're like at 4%. I was looking at that list.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:20):
They're around 4%, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):
That's unreal.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:22):
It used to be open source was the top three. Unfortunately, Jula and Drupal have fallen behind, and so now it's like Shopify, Wix, Squarespace are the top ones but WordPress is still, because we have this flywheel of open source community, its movements, any open source like Linux or Apache or Wikipedia, it has some positive flywheel effects when it takes off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
Awesome, okay. And then there's a few other things you didn't mention, I want to get to this later, but I'll just mention now, you guys own Tumblr, you bought Tumblr, which I don't think a lot of people necessarily know.

Matt Mullenweg (00:10:56):
I'm sorry, I forgot to mention that, Tumblr.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:58):
We're going to get into that, yeah.

Matt Mullenweg (00:11:00):
Yeah, running a social network is definitely the hardest thing I've ever attempted. I thought we knew what we were doing because WordPress ran so much of the web, we dealt with, I thought, every content moderation thing you could ever deal with, but social networks are a whole other ballgame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):
Okay, a couple more fun facts before we get into some other stuff I want to chat about. Fun fact number one is you were super involved in the Bay Lights project. I didn't know this. For people that don't know what the Bay Lights, if you're in San Francisco you definitely know what the Bay Lights project is and I'm sure you love it, for people that don't know what this is about, what is this project and how have you been involved? Why have you been instrumental in to make this a thing?

Matt Mullenweg (00:11:37):
Bay Lights, there's two famous bridges in San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, which is kind of the iconic one, there's actually the Bay Bridge, which is the workhorse of San Francisco. It's one of the busiest bridges in the country. And it's really beautiful from an engineering point of view. And so kind of a vision between Ben Davis and artist Leo Villarreal, who's an amazing light artist, actually who started Burning Man was to put, gosh, I forget the number, I think 18,000 LEDs on the side of the bridge on all the cables and create this really beautiful, gentle kind of algorithmic light piece, light art piece.

(00:12:18):
And yeah, Ben Davis was dating an artist friend of mine and we were over and having drinks on my patio and we were looking at the Bay Bridge and I had this kind of thing where there's some lights at the top of the Bay Bridge and I was like, "Oh, wouldn't it be cool if those lights were Christmas lights and they could do patterns or something?" It's the lights to keep planes from hitting it. And I was like, "Oh, you could program that." He was like, "Yeah." It was almost like the Social Network thing where a million's cool, but a billion would be really cool. He was like, "Yeah, that would be cool, but what if we put the whole side of it?" And so I was like, "Oh, cool," and sort of made an angel investment in that thing. They hadn't raised anything or had, I don't even think an entity at that point, but I was like to get you started, I forget what it was, 100 or 150k so I gave them that first bit and then it kind of blossomed into a thing.

(00:13:07):
And then sort of fast-forward, I don't remember the exact timeline, but they were kind of at a final bit of fundraise and they weren't able to close that last bit and I actually mortgaged my condos and donated the last million, million and a half to finish out that project. The Bay Lights were online for 10 years. The technology degraded, and so the environment's very harsh. So actually we just completed a fundraise and are reinstalling the Bay Lights. They're calling it Bay Lights 360. So now it'll be both sides of the bridge, it'll be visible from also Oakland and the Treasure Island because the first version, the city was very worried about the drivers seeing the lights and it might distract them so we had to angle them so that you could only see it from San Francisco, which was a compromise we didn't love because we love the East Bay and everything else like that too. So new version is coming online hopefully later this year in the fall. And also that turned into a nonprofit called Illuminate, which I'm on the board of run by Ben Davis, who I mentioned previously, that does cool public art stuff around the city. So they're responsible for the Grace Lights, all the JFK Boulevard stuff where that has some murals and the beer garden and all the chairs, that's all Illuminate. So their thing is radical public art. So it's like art that needs to be free and accessible. And I think that's so important for San Francisco. We have great institutions know the SF, MoMA, the Opera, etc, that have huge budgets like 100 million a year and Illuminate literally one 10th of that has created something that millions of people can enjoy.

(00:14:40):
And I like to think that anyone along the Embarcadero, you might be going through a tough time, obviously we have people who are struggling with mental health and homelessness and everything like that, but maybe seeing a little bit of art can help raise your soul a little bit. And that's how I think about philanthropy as well. You need to work on the base issues, the fundamentals at the bottom of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and then you also have to work on the things that raise your soul a little bit, so arts. So I like that barbell approach to philanthropy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):
Elon has a great quote along those lines, "You can't just work on solving problems all day, you need something inspiring to think about and to work towards." First of all, thank you for doing this. If you live in SF, you're like, this makes the city better, just having this around. I didn't realize you were involved in helping come up with the idea itself. I know that you did mortgaged your house to make it possible.

Matt Mullenweg (00:15:32):
I can't take any credit for the idea, I was exposed to it. I had an adjacent idea and they had a way cooler one with a real artist and everything like that. So I was just happy to be there. It's like being an angel investor, you can support the entrepreneurs and the people who truly do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:49):
Yeah, okay. And the other funny thing you said is about they were worried about the angle of the lights distracting people. What's funny is when I drive across the bridge, you can only see it when you're driving towards San Francisco looking backwards. So I'm looking in my rearview mirror or in the mirror turning around to the kind and it feels more dangerous, the lights shining in my face.

Matt Mullenweg (00:16:07):
They call it impossible works of art. There were like 13 agencies that had to sign off, they were worried the lights would distract birds or seals or environmental reviews, and it was really a lot of public bureaucrats and to make that happen, there was 20 places where someone could have said no and it never would happen. So it's very inspiring to see the city come together.

(00:16:31):
Also in San Francisco, I feel like is entering new chapter right now, going from the doom loop to the boom loop. I'm a big believer in the city. So much innovation has come here from food, the burrito, fortune cookies, all these sorts of things are from San Francisco to obviously all the tech innovation that we're all familiar with. It's kind of the city of the future and I don't know what it is in the water from the '60s until now, cultural innovations, things that happen and influenced the whole world, Burning Man, Grateful Dead, et cetera. That all starts in San Francisco. So it's exciting to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:03):
Let's set the so back, as they say on Twitter. Okay, someone very close to you told me that you're an excellent rapper. I'm not going to ask you to rap, but if you ever want to answer any questions in rap form, feel free.

Matt Mullenweg (00:17:17):
Oh man, that would be fun. I've dreamed about being able to do a Q&A and rhyme, but I don't think I'm that talented.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:26):
Planting the seed, I'm planting the seed. So I want to get into all the drama there in this world and right now, but I want to first lay the foundation of how you got into this and where this all came from. So let's talk about just the origin story of you and open source. More than half of your life, you've been working on open source, you've been working on WordPress, specifically WordPress is such a core community within the open source. What was kind of the origin story of you becoming obsessed and, I don't know, open source-pilled?

Matt Mullenweg (00:17:56):
I was a broke kid in Houston, Texas, and my passions were jazz. Houston has actually amazing music programs in the public schools, and so I was very fortunate to go to some of the best civil arts programs, including my high school called the High School for Performing and Visual Arts, where Beyoncé went, Robert Glasper, amazing folks went there. And so music was a big part of my life, and actually economics. So I had this fun teacher, Scott Roman, who participated in our school in the Federal Reserve Challenge, which was run by the Federal Reserve that sets the interest rates and backs the national banking system and everything like that, has this competition for high school students. It ended up being the first academic competition this art school ever won. And yeah, first year we kind of didn't get that far, second year we went all the way to nationals so I got to meet Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke was our judge, went to DC. So that was very, very exciting.

(00:19:01):
And so being exposed to us having a great liberal arts education, the ideas of Frederick Hayek, Agnes Smith, Alexander Hamilton, Ben Franklin, Thucydides, all these sorts of things, that philosophy really influenced me. And combine that with that, music lessons were expensive, so we couldn't really afford them, so I would barter and trade. I'd build websites for local musicians and exchange for lessons. So these websites, I would start to put software on forums or different things and that kind of exposed me to open source. So my father was also an engineer, he worked for oil companies and things, but his world was all Microsoft, it was all proprietary. And I always kind of grew up in early days of the internet, so was Slashdots and Jeffrey Zeldman talked about web standards and all these things are really kind of the social milieu and zeitgeist that I grew up in.

(00:19:56):
So combining all this philosophy I studied, it felt that open source was actually the most important idea of our generation. If the founding fathers were around today, I think they would be open source advocates. If you think about it as more and more of our lives are influenced and actually controlled by the software we use, if we don't have fundamental freedoms attached to that software, we're not truly free.

(00:20:24):
So WordPress is under license called the GPL, which has four freedoms, the freedom to use the software for any purpose, so we can use it for anything, whether I agree with you or not, the terms of service is you could do whatever you want with it. The freedom to see how the software works, open up the hood, see how it works, see every line of code, you can audit it. The freedom to change it is the third freedom. And then finally the freedom to redistribute those changes so you can share them. And the GPL has a fun little hack where if you share them, you have to provide those same freedoms to who you share it with. So it's called a viral open source license as opposed to the MIT license or some of the others that aren't.

(00:21:03):
So yeah, just kind of decided that this was what I was going to devote my life to. And so that became getting involved with some early open source projects, WordPress was actually a fork of abandoned open source project called B2. So the code base actually started was something that was already out there that I was a user and contributor to kind of volunteer on the forums and contribute code. And then when it was abandoned, myself and Mike were one of four or five different forks that started that, picked it up and tried to continue it for our own use and then later for our larger community.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):
It feels like a lot of people are coming around to exactly your worldview in, say, I was just watching a video of Jack Dorsey talking about how we're just controlled by algorithms and we don't know how they work and we are not in control of our lives. Have you seen that video?

Matt Mullenweg (00:21:52):
No, but I actually love that. Also, some people who maybe made their first billion or whatever from proprietary software then come back and it's so cool to see folks like Marc Andreessen or Bill Gurley be huge advocates for open source. I actually remember one of my early meetings with Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen. I didn't realize that at the time, Tony Schneider and I were sort fundraising and Marc really grilled us, he's like, "How can you build a business on open source? How can you be remote and distributed? Look around Silicon Valley, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, every great company has had an office. How are you going to build something that can change the internet with people all around the world?" And just had this long hour long debate and we walked out of that, I was like, "Wow, that was the worst meeting ever. They just hate everything we're doing."

(00:22:48):
And then the next day they were like, "Hey, we're interested." I was like, "What happened?" I didn't realize that he had this idea where he wanted to attack the ideas and see how we defended it was how they battle tested things. I guess kind of like a Microsoft culture or whatever where you really grill the idea, I just wasn't familiar with that. But it's so cool now that some of these folks that I've learned so much from are such good advocates for open source.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):
Yeah, it's so interesting. I just had the Community Notes team on the podcast, and that's an amazing example of open source, Meta is adopting it from Twitter/X. Speaking of open source, one of the interesting, maybe most common ways people hear about open source these days is AI and AI models, and there's a couple areas here, one is you wrote this really interesting post where you talk about how Meta talks about Llama as an open source project, but you called it a false prophet. What is it about Llama that isn't open source? What are people missing when they see Llama and they're like, "Oh, Meta is amazing open sourcing everything."

Matt Mullenweg (00:23:52):
Llama, you can obviously download and run locally and all these sorts of things, right? You don't have to use their SaaS service. However, there's a clause in it that says if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users...

Matt Mullenweg (00:24:00):
... as if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users. I forget what it is. It's big. It's like 750 million, so it's pretty high. You need a license from them. And so that does not give you the freedom to use the software for any purpose. If at some point you have to ask for permission, you're kind of at the whims of this company who you might be aligned with or you might be an enemy with. And also, how do you define that? So, for example, on WordPress, our products don't have 750 million monthly active registered users, but we reach billions of people per month in terms of visitors. So, is that defined? So, there's just ambiguity there. So, I still think what they've done is amazing and I like that they're releasing it. I was very confused for why they insist on calling it open source because they...

(00:24:54):
Actually, Meta has been a huge open source contributor. React. They've had incredible improvements to the PHP engine, which we benefit from a lot. So, they're actually a big open source contributor. I think Mark Zuckerberg really understands and loves open source too. My best guess now, I don't have any inside information here, but I think they're calling it open source because there's some European regulation about open source versus proprietary AI models. So, I think it might be a weird regulatory thing because clearly they understand this isn't open source. When I wrote the blog post, I was just kind of confused, and thought, "Oh, maybe if I get this message out there, they'll change." And then when they didn't, I was like, "Oh, there must be something else going on. I think it might be this regulatory thing." We were actually a big part of, actually many, many years ago, I think it was React that they were doing something with a licensing or a patent restriction on, and the WordPress community actually got Meta to change that and reverse something they were doing to lock it down.

(00:25:53):
So, I consider my role as an open source advocate to actually be my primary thing. And it's very much my life mission. I hope to work on WordPress the rest of my life, but also just open source in general. I also support Drupal and Joomla. Anything else that's open source, I'm going to be a supporter of because I think when people choose that versus proprietary software, we're increasing the freedom and liberty in the world. It's incumbent on us to make open source, to make a better user experience, to make a better product so that people choose it, and then the world becomes more free, not less free.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):
It also feels it's important to you to, I don't know, white open source washing, like avoid people using the term when it's not true. And it's interesting in this case, that the thing that makes it not truly open source is the limit. There's a limit where you can no longer use it the way you want. Is that the issue?

Matt Mullenweg (00:26:53):
Yeah. And there's actually an open source OSI. There's a formal definition for what makes an open source license. And there's actually many dozens of open source licenses, and sort of public domain licenses and other things. So, it's also their stance that this is not an open source license.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):
Something else that I think is really interesting when it comes to AI and open source, you wrote about this and it blew my mind, such a good point, that the code that these models were trained on was open source code because that's all they have access to. They don't have Windows code, they don't have Shopify code. And what a cool, I don't know, another success story slash... I don't know. I guess, how do you feel about that, that all these AI models are trained on code you wrote in open source community?

Matt Mullenweg (00:27:43):
That's beautiful. It's one of the safest things to train on, right, because the license of open source very explicitly allows that. I also like to think about I have some window where my creative output is useful to society. And if you fast forward like 50 or 100, I do believe that the utility for proprietary software eventually approaches zero. When we're sending people to Mars, the operating system of the rockets and the devices and everything like that is not going to be built on the Windows NT kernel, as amazing feat of engineering that that proprietary kernel is. It's going to be built on an open source kernel, Linux or BSD or something like that. And so if you want to be part of something that sort of becomes the fabric of humanity's foundation, like things that allows a Cambrian explosion of things built on top of it, a renaissance of ideas, you want to be involved with open source.

(00:28:38):
And so I really hope that more and more people... I'm a little bit of an evangelist here. I'm a missionary, where I really want to encourage more and more people to consider at least making part of their time, even if just a few hours a week, contributing to open source because you could be part of something that is a huge impact. And it's fun, especially if you're a younger developer or designer or PM or whatever, you can't walk up to Facebook and change your home page or say, "I'd like to change this feature," but you could come to an open source project, some of which have hundreds of millions of users. You could go to WordPress or, gosh, Bitcoin.

(00:29:20):
Or there's all these things are open source, Chromium, Firefox, and you could actually change a feature or project management things or change the design or improve it. And that's I think really, really special. And sort of the thrill for me of knowing that code I wrote is now executing millions of times per seconds and millions of servers around the world, that kind of thrill, that high is, when I first had my first open source contribution, such a thrill. And I've been sort of chasing that and enjoying that ever since.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):
Say someone wants to actually do this, where do they go? How do they do this? Do they just pick up a project, go to WordPress. org and here's how you contribute? What's a next step there?

Matt Mullenweg (00:30:03):
Yeah, pick a project that you use or like. That's obviously a nice one. For WordPress, we have this... It's called make.WordPress.org. That's where we make WordPress. And there's different groups, there's accessibility, there's design, there's the core code, there's plugins, there's all sorts of ways. So, really whatever your talent is, there's people who translate, there's people who do support, there's people who write documentation, there's people who organize events, so whatever you feel like your talent in the world is either that you have or that you want to cultivate. I learned how to code while building WordPress basically. I didn't have too much formal training there. So, it's a great way to [inaudible 00:30:48] your skills as well, and work with some of the best developers and others in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):
This also made me think about AI agents are coming around, Devin and all these AI driven coding agents. Do you have a prediction at when most of the code contributed to the open source projects will be Devin and AI agents such type projects?

Matt Mullenweg (00:31:10):
I think Google talked about 25% of their code or characters committed are now sort of AI-assisted, and they're probably on the bleeding edge. I don't know how much of WordPress's code right now is AI-assisted or something like that. But I think over the next five years it definitely approaches maybe a majority. And I'm actually very, very excited, so one of the big challenges that we have as a very open platform is we have this open plugin and theme architecture, so the 60,000 plugins and themes and the way WordPress works is these plugins and themes can modify every single part of the code, so you can really customize everything. However, many of these plugins and themes don't have the same sort of robust security and review process that core has. So, that's where when you hear about security issues with WordPress, it's very rarely in core anymore.

(00:32:03):
We haven't had a remote exploit, knock on wood, it's like I think five or six years or something, but in the plugins it can be somewhat more frequent. And so one thing I'm very, very excited about the next year or two is actually more automated scanning because obviously that code basis is so many tens of millions, maybe over 100 million lines of code at this point. It's impossible for humans to review that, so we kind of rely on developers to review that and manage. And of course, we have bug bounties and everything do that, so when things get reported, we fix it quickly. But I can't wait for more automated scanning there, and I think that could vastly upgrade the security of open source. The other thing that's really exciting is right now you see people building apps and stuff and it's just sort of custom generated code, but I think the next generation of these models or sort of the next layer there is because...

(00:32:54):
As everyone knows, just writing the code is just one part of it. It's maintaining it that really becomes the life cycle of it. And Stewart Brand's new book is all about maintenance, which I'm very excited about. He's publishing, I think, with Strike. And it's actually kind of open source. He's open sourcing the book, so you can see it being written online. But anyway, to go back, I think that if... And they're starting to do that, is when the open source models you say like, "Hey, build me a website." It actually installs WordPress, and then builds on top of that, and then customizes on top of that. Then you get for free that core engine that's always being audited and updated and getting passkey support or whatever the new things are sort of continuously. And then your custom stuff can be on top of that, which I think is actually a lot more powerful than building something proprietary or custom from the ground up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:43):
I love this book concept about maintenance. My sister's partner has this quote that I've always come back to, "Life is maintenance." You basically... Everything you acquire and deal with... You get a generator for your house, you have to maintain that forever now. You get this backpack, okay, now you have to maintain this thing, keep it nice, nice jacket. Everything is maintenance. Everything in your life is just maintenance. And I wonder if that's what the book's about.

Matt Mullenweg (00:34:09):
Well, that's why I think technical debt is one of the most interesting concepts. There's so many companies as well that maybe have big market caps, but I feel like they might have billions or tens of billions of dollars of technical debt. You can see in the interface or how their products integrate with themselves through things. And I think about that a lot in our own company. We definitely have some products, almost a little embarrassed coming on because you have such great product people. And we have some variable quality around some of our things right now. If you check out Gravatar right now, I'm actually really proud of it. It's I think a really great user experience, very slick. But there's parts of... Well, I always say, "I'm the unhappiest WordPress user in the world," so there's parts of WordPress and WordPress.com that I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of.

(00:34:52):
We have a really large surface area that we cover with relatively few people, and so there's some parts we haven't looked at in a little while that we need to get around to. And it's a big focus for us this year, is actually kind of going back to basics, back to core, and improving all of those kind of nooks and crannies of the user experience, and also ruthlessly editing and cutting as much as possible, because we just launched a lot of stuff over the past 21 years that maybe is not as relevant today or it doesn't need to be there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):
That sounds like excellent work for this AI agent of the future that's coming soon. There's one other area I want to mine and that's community, community building, building this ecosystem that you've created around WordPress. It might be one of the most successful, biggest communities on the internet. I'm curious just what lessons you've learned about what it takes to build a successful community, online especially.

Matt Mullenweg (00:35:48):
This is probably influenced by economics and jazz. And economics is all about systems thinking. And what are the incentive structures of how you set something up? And then in jazz is all about collaboration. So, if there's something unique I have for your audience, I would say it's don't just build a product, build a movement. And to the extent that we've been successful, I think it's that we give people something to believe in, a philosophy, a worldview. Even silly things, like we had this tagline in the footer of the WordPress.org when we started, it's still there, it says, "Code is poetry." This idea that we're not just writing code, we're trying to create something that can have elements. We name every WordPress release after a jazz musician for the past 60 releases or so. So, those sorts of things bring a little art and soul and some fun into it as well.

(00:36:44):
It doesn't have to be serious all the time. I think they can give something to believe in and work on and aim towards that's more than just a paycheck or more than just the utility, the base utility of the software. So, it's not just the software, it's also like: how are the meetups? How are people getting together? What events are you running? Are there forums? How do people contribute? Is there office hours or town halls? I do a lot of Q&A. So, what are the things you're doing around the software that's allowing people to get involved, that's inviting contributions, that's allowing people to build on top of it? I've studied platforms quite a bit like Microsoft and others, so our whole ecosystem of plugins and themes is part of what's made WordPress so successful, and the moat that we have.

(00:37:33):
The core features of a CMS, you can kind of write with a few developers in a few weeks or something. It's not... It's basically CRUD operations, but to replicate those 60,000 plugins and themes, gosh, no one's done it. That's a huge moat. And proprietary services can create platforms. Shopify has a third-party ecosystem and things like that, but it's never a true platform. And a true platform, it's when your ecosystem makes more money than the core does. And so many times, whether it was the Facebook platform, I'm putting that in air quotes, or the Shopify platform, companies build on it and then they get the rug pulled out from under them because they're too successful.

(00:38:15):
And then the sort of thing you're building on decides, "Oh, we want that money or we want that growth." And they sort of change the API or remove your access. There's so many examples of this, especially on, I think, Facebook and Shopify and others, where people got too successful and all of a sudden they knock on the door and they say, "Oh, that's a mighty nice app you have there. I'd love to offer you some warrants where we own a bunch of your company or we're going to shut it off," or those sorts of things.

(00:38:42):
And again, you don't have freedom unless you're building on open source. That's why more and more companies and people are choosing... If they're going to build a business on top of something else, if you build it on an open source, you have that guarantee. Even if I grew devil horns and became evil and automatic decided to know whatever, WordPress would still belong just as much to you as it would to me. People can fork the code. They can still own it. They can still build on top of it. So, those things I think are really important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):
What a segue to all of this drama that's swirling around you these days. I think a lot of people do feel like there's devil horns that have appeared, and so I'm excited to dig into this stuff. I find that every time you go on a podcast these days, if we don't get into this, everyone's just like, "Why is Matt not answering these questions?" Let's get into the hard stuff. So, I'm going to ask you some hard questions. For people that don't know what the hell's going on, they're like, "What are you even talking about?" or just have a sense something is swirling with WordPress and, Matt, I don't know what's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?

Matt Mullenweg (00:39:48):
So ,to set it, you can get WordPress from WordPress.com or us, but also you can get WordPress from dozens of other hosts. The biggest in the world are like GoDaddy, Hostinger, Newfold. It's not the biggest, but it is in the top 10 or something. It has about 700,000 WordPress installs. There's a company called WP Engine. In 2019, WP Engine started as very WordPress oriented and they contributed a lot to the community and everything like that. They were very respectful about distinguishing themselves from core, so people really realized it wasn't officially associated and everything. But in 2019 they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. And anyone who follows business, when private equity buys something, there's some the good ones, but there's also many, many stories about how they can really hollow things out, really optimize our profits, become user hostile.

(00:40:45):
Actually recently read a story where one of the reasons there was a shortage of firetrucks these LA fires was that the fire truck manufacturers have been rolled up by a private equity firm, and they've been raising prices and their supply constraint and things like that. So, there's literally a shortage in firetrucks right now because of private equity. And of course, if you look at healthcare or other things, there's so many examples of where private equity can really, I think, be one of the darker parts of capitalism. So, since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit, and they really stopped contributing to core and they started using the trademark in a way that was very confusing in the marketplace. And particularly in the past year, year and a half or so, we're just getting lot... I get a lot of support for requests for WP Engine.

(00:41:36):
And when we do surveys, we'd find that 20, 30, 40% of people thought they were officially associated because how they were using our logo and presenting the brand and everything like that was very confusing to people. And as you know, if you don't protect a trademark, you lose it. And also the version of WordPress that they were offering actually wasn't our core vision of the functionality of WordPress. So to save money, they were actually turning off features like revisions. So, a cool part about WordPress that... actually one of my favorite features, is every change to every single post or page is saved forever, just like Wikipedia. So, if you make a mistake, you can always undo it. And of course, as building a great product, that sort of user safety of an undo is so critical.

(00:42:19):
Now, obviously you have to store these revisions, so it takes up more database space. Now, it's trivial, it's megabytes, so on modern databases is not that big a deal. But to save money, they actually turned us off, so they broke the undo feature in WordPress to essentially save money. And so you have this thing where they're offering something called WordPress. I think I refer to it as a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand, and then also people think it's official. So, even close friends of mine were like, "Oh yeah, I signed up for this thing. I thought I was supporting you."

(00:42:49):
And it's came to a head. So, past 18 months they've also... We contacted them and said, "Hey, you need a trademark license or something if you're going to use this or change how you're doing things," and tried to negotiate something and had many different term sheets over the months offered and different things, and they just kept stretching it out. And I was like, "What's going on here?" And I think part of what was going on is last year they tried to sell the company. So, private equity usually holds things for five to seven years, so they were kind of five years into this. They tried to shop it around and sell it. They weren't able to find a buyer.

(00:43:25):
They said, "Well, they don't have any IP, and it feels like they're using your trademark, so they're going to have trouble with you. They don't have a license and things like that." So, while they were negotiating with us, it appears they were also preparing this lawsuit against us. So again, I've been very fortunate in my business career that we've invested in dozens of companies, we've acquired lots of things, by and large, 99% of the time people I've dealt with in business have been ethical, straightforward, honest. I haven't really faced any baldfaced lying or duplicitous behavior. Very, very rarely people who just say one thing and do another or are fraudulent in their behavior, but I think that was happening here.

(00:44:17):
And so I also just wasn't prepared for it. I was thinking I was a little naive and kind of didn't realize what was going on for a while. So, it came to a head, and at WordCamp US in September, I was like, "Okay, well, if you're still not going to even agree to negotiate, I'm going to give this presentation about how I think both private equity has messed up a lot of open source projects in the past, and how in particular, [inaudible 00:44:46] has done some very bad or evil things." And they were like, "Okay, go for it." So, I did the presentation. I think it was on a Thursday or a Friday. Kind of spicy. People were like, "Oh, can't believe he did that."

(00:45:00):
And then on Monday they launched this with Quinn Emanuel, which is kind of the baddest, nastiest law firm, it's like who Elon uses when he sues people, launched this big multimillion dollar lawsuit against both me personally and WordPress.org, so the WordPress community and Automattic. And also they're spending millions of dollars a month on both lawyers and PR. So, they're doing... If you read... Oh gosh, who was the celebrity that they were recently talking about this, like dark PR stuff where they're boosting things on social networks?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
Oh, Blake Lively and-

Matt Mullenweg (00:45:37):
Blake Lively, yeah, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):
... the other guy.

Matt Mullenweg (00:45:38):
So, all that stuff is happening, so there's... And I warned people. I think in the presentation I say, "Hey, there's going to be a smear campaign against me." And internally in the company, I was like, "Hey, they're going to dig up everything that's ever happens. Anything bad anyone's ever said to me is going to all of a sudden become a news item." And that has happened. It's been true. So, right now there is a portion of the internet that does think I have devil horns and everything. Fortunately, this is not my first rodeo. I know a lot of people think like, "Oh, Matt was nice for 20 years, and then got mean." But one thing, if you're really open and open source, sometimes you have to stand up the bullies, and you have to fight to protect your open source ideals.

(00:46:19):
Otherwise people could take advantage of it in a way that ultimately can destroy everything you've created. So, this is probably the fourth time the internet has decided I'm the main character or really evil. And the previous ones we don't remember anymore. It's Hot Nacho or the Easter Massacre of Themes or these are the things that aren't even on my Wikipedia page anymore, but those seemed like really big deals at the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):
Those are your incidents. Those weren't like historical battles.

Matt Mullenweg (00:46:46):
No, no, these are things that, yeah, I was involved in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):
Cool names at least.

Matt Mullenweg (00:46:49):
Including some things I had screwed up, like Hot Nacho was definitely a screw-up on my end very early in the WordPress side, but...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:55):
Wow. Okay, I'm not going to follow those threads, but those are great names.

(00:47:59):
So, you mentioned this talk you gave at WordCamp, and you said at the beginning of the talk, like, "I'm-"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
... at WordCamp, and you said at the beginning of the talk... oh no, afterwards you were like, "I was really nervous to give this talk," and obviously you can see why. Just what finally convinced you this was time? Was it just to go, as you described, scorched earth nuclear? Was it like WordCamp is coming up and this is the moment to go public with this? Was there something else that kind of crossed the line?

Matt Mullenweg (00:48:24):
It was a unique opportunity because we were essentially saying that, hey, WP Engine isn't going to be allowed to sponsor WordCamps anymore. They're not going to be a... Because we had, again, up to that point really done everything to bring them in and have to be part of the community. So I really had to also explain to our community, hey, why we're going to be excluding this company that a lot of people saw as doing good. If you go to the WP Engine website, they have whole pages about how much they contribute and give back and how they... they do kind of greenwash or open source wash a lot of what they do. So all their marketing branding was around this positive stuff, and so I was like, "Hey, we need to just explain this case."

(00:49:03):
But yeah, again, my defaults and how we've worked with, by the way, every other company in the WordPress space, many of which are much, much larger and make sometimes billions more in revenue than WP Engine, is collaborative. So if there's a trademark violation, usually it's not even lawyers get involved. It's just like there's a email, we have a conversation, we do a call, we talk about it. That's how things get resolved and that's my default. I'm a lover, not a fighter, and that's why this thing doesn't happen very often. I like to say that, yes, if WordPress community or whatever was doing this like every year or every couple months, yeah, you should worry about it, but it kind of happens every like 10 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:46):
So if I could mirror back the issues that you ran into, and I want to go through this a little bit more, the problems you had with WP Engine in this case. One is they were using the trademark both WordPress and WooCommerce without license, and they're just abusing it, confusing people. A lot of people thought WP Engine was actually Automattic and WordPress official. They weren't contributing to the project. They were just making basically a bunch of money and not doing the work off this company they bought and they're just kind of hollowing it out as you described. And then they're also cutting corners, making the product worse, and that kind of reflects on the whole brand of WordPress.

Matt Mullenweg (00:50:22):
That's a great summary, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):
Awesome. I'm curious just which of those three, or is it something even else that most bothered you about this? What's just like, "This is the thing that's eating me"? If I had to guess, it'd be damaging the legacy potentially of this thing you've worked on for most of your life. Maybe it's that, maybe it's just taking advantage of the community. What's the thing that you think is the root of this, just like, "Just this needs to stop"?

Matt Mullenweg (00:50:50):
Well, I guess the one thing I'd add to your list was as this was happening they were pretending to good faith negotiate. And in fact, at one point the executive, we were talking about her joining Automattic and running WordPress out of Oregon and when she thought... the VP and she going to sell, she was thinking about what was next. So yeah, a lot of this stuff was, I think that duplicitous behavior also kind of forced us to an edge more than even those other things that you mentioned. There's lots of companies that don't contribute back and it's not as big a deal. But yeah, the legal issue was definitely the trademark thing. So what pushed it to the edge? I think just the magnitude of the issue. They would refer to themselves as WordPress Engine in client meetings and other things. They were very cavalier about how they would imply their association with the project.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
Obviously, as you can tell on socials, a lot of people are just really upset and a lot of people blame you. There's just, like I said, every time you're on a podcast or on Twitter, people are just like, "Matt, what about this? Why this sucks? Why are you doing this?" And I want to go through some of those things, but just not many people go through... I think you were like a hundred percent beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this... a lot of people don't like you. Just as a human, just what is that? How do you work through that? How do you deal with that? What's that been like?

Matt Mullenweg (00:52:17):
If you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years, and when we introduced something like Gutenberg, people hated it. Actually when we introduced a visual editor, people hated it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):
You've had practice.

Matt Mullenweg (00:52:30):
These are huge controversies in the WordPress history. There actually hasn't been a fork or WordPress around all this latest stuff, but there was when we introduced Gutenberg. It's one called ClassicPress where people actually forked the software. So how I would describe it is previously like 1% of the world thought I was terrible, and now I feel like it's up to like 4 or 5%. So it's still not the majority, but as you know, something negative you feel seven times more than something positive. And when people are angry with you, it's kind of like restaurant reviews or whatever, they're more likely to leave a bad review than a good review.

(00:53:14):
The people who WordPress, 98% of all the core developers have stayed and contribute and are working on the next version and are supportive and all these sorts of things. And part of the reason these folks are so good is they don't spend all their time on Twitter and Reddit arguing with folks, and also the arguments could be... they're very frustrating because people don't engage in good faith. They don't really change their mind when new facts are introduced.

(00:53:43):
And so I've done my best actually because from the open source side I'm really used to engaging with things, and I think that's been one thing I've learned from this is in some forums it doesn't matter how you engage and especially if you have bots or other things running there. I'd leave comments on Reddit and immediately get like 40 downvotes. I'm like, "Hey, this is a article about me and I'm adding a fact to the thing. Why is it getting downvoted? This is very relevant to the discussion." But it's literally hidden. So when you see that thread, you'd have to click like three or four times to see the comment I had left, and so it can really change the perception. And then when you read these things, I think it's just very human nature. Even folks very close to me, if you read a thread and it's all super negative, it's hard to not be influenced by that because we're social creatures.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):
100%.

Matt Mullenweg (00:54:37):
Now the good news is I've had lots of credibility weighted support from people like Marc Benioff or other open source leaders or the core people in WordPress, Matias, Mary Hubbard, all the core committers. The international community actually, like just in Japan, they don't care about this stuff. So these are actually, if you look by number of commits and lines of code and everything like that, the folks who actually are most crucial in WordPress. So I feel like that's been a good balance as well for me because there are days where I'm like, "Gosh, am I an idiot?" or it could be really down reading all these things. So that is part of what allows me to balance and get back to that sort of positive, optimistic space that I think you need to be in to do great software and great work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):
Yeah. The internet can be brutal. Let me go through a couple of specific things that people pointed out because I think you've been on a lot of podcasts and people haven't asked you these questions and I think a lot of people are just like, "But, Matt, what about this? This is really bad." So let me just ask you a couple of things here. One is there's just like a frustration in the community around the instability that this has just caused in the WordPress community. I'll read you a couple quotes. "Real people are receiving fewer projects on WordPress because C-suite are seeing WordPress as unstable because of this feud, and I work at Enterprise and we're very concerned about the stability of this platform and our projects." Just thoughts on that and the impact that it's had on the community.

Matt Mullenweg (00:56:05):
Yeah, I think this is until this gets resolved... which by the way I hope it is soon. I think there's no business reason for this to continue. I really hope that they come to a settlement or something. We're ready. They could end this tomorrow if they wanted to. WP Engine could. We can't. We're just defending right now. So it's really incumbent on them. All of our competitors, by the way, are like, "Great. WordPress, the king on the hill, all of a sudden we can use this." And so there's also not just from WP Engine, but also from all the competitors to WordPress, and all the people who would love to capture some market share, they're really leaning into this. So I've seen white papers, I've seen all sorts of things where people talk about this.

(00:56:49):
We're actually in the next couple of days going to publish something really cool on the WordPress.org blog though that shows if you actually look at the numbers, like the activity, number of commits, plugin updates, downloads, installs of WordPress since September 20th when this all started, it's quite healthy. And so I'm not saying that there isn't examples of where someone lost a project or something like that. I'm sure it's happened. It's the internet's big. WordPress has so many millions of users and developers and everything that you're going to get some example. But by the numbers things are actually quite healthy, and in some ways it's not that there's no press is bad press, it's raised the awareness of WordPress quite a bit. So people who haven't talked about WordPress in years are now like, "Oh, Let's talk about it." And so a little bit of drama I think, I wouldn't do this all the time, but a little bit can be a good thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):
Okay, so one of the most common frustrations I've seen on the internet, people complaining is around the trademark. I don't know all the details, but my understanding is there's kind of a... you moved the trademark to be owned by the foundation and Automattic is exclusive rights to use the trademark. And I think people are like, "Oh, I thought it was the foundation owned it, but maybe Matt still owns it and then you're trying to monetize it through this agreement with WP Engine." Is there anything you can share there that'll make people feel and see your side of the story?

Matt Mullenweg (00:58:10):
Yeah, this is totally fair because it's complicated, but people are saying this has been private. This has all been very public and documented on the internet from the beginning. So WordPress.org has always been me personally, and I think because it's... part of the reason we started there is . com was not available when we started. So that's why we started on the .org and things like that. But I think people also assume .org means nonprofit or something, and that's sometimes true but it's not always. It's not a requirement of the .org domain. Then when I founded Automattic and when we did register the trademark that actually was registered under Automattic. So it used to be, for the first five years of the project or whatever, that Automattic just owned everything outright. And again, I had investors and the board and that was under the control of that.

(00:59:06):
Now, as Automattic became more successful I was able to consolidate some voting rights and other things and at least later advocate. Also remember, I was like 21 when all this was happening, so I was not maybe the most savvy about legal stuff or didn't always have the best advice. So later as I learned more, I was like, "Oh, I want to actually take this out of the company and create a nonprofit." And so we ended up creating a nonprofit. Now the rules around 501(3)(C) nonprofits run the IRS are actually very strict. So that's also something as people assume, it's like, oh, doesn't the nonprofit run the software, and we applied for that originally and it was denied by the IRS.

(00:59:47):
So we actually weren't able to put WordPress.org or the software itself under the nonprofit, but we were able to have sort of an educational purview. So what was eventually approved was sort of running the meetups and other things for WordPress, doing educational stuff. We sponsor a lot of learn to code or running workshops in other countries. We have this cool thing called do_action where we'll do a weekend where we take a bunch of nonprofits and build websites for them and stuff like that. So the nonprofit does a lot of exciting things there and then also negotiated with the investors and everyone at Automattic to actually put the trademark under the foundation.

(01:00:31):
Now the compromise there was that Automattic at this point is running WordPress.com. So to continue running that, which at the time had already tens of millions of users and everything, it needed a commercial license. And so the compromise is that the foundation would kind of own the trademark and license it out for non-commercial purposes. I had a license to run WordPress.org because obviously I need that. And then Automattic would retain the commercial license and the ability to sub-license that, so to sell that to others. So this was kind of the grand compromise and create this tripartite structure. I was very inspired by the three branches of government. So there's sort of power in each of those that I think sort of checks and balances each side of it which is on purpose.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:23):
Wow. Okay, I get why it's complicated. I get why people would be confused. This makes me think about OpenAI had a really strange structure and that got them in a lot of trouble, and it feels like when you're 21 you're like, "Oh, this makes a lot of sense. What a great concept we've come up here," and then all this complexity just adds to a lot of confusion around what's going on. So thank you for addressing that. Another, there's a kind of related question I've seen a couple of times is just why don't you let that .org be run by a community. Why not just give that up to someone else and not just you that's there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:01:53):
Yeah, and the frame of that question is kind of interesting because it implies I'm the only person making WordPress which is obviously not true. If you look at the daily commits and activity and everything, it is run by the community. So it's hundreds of volunteers every day that are actually doing the day-to-day work and making the daily decisions and everything happens. So there has been a radical delegation. However, there's ultimately a hierarchy, and I'm the CEO, so I'm like the final final decision-maker.

(01:02:24):
And so I think what people advocate for around this governance point of view is like, okay, well, install a board on top of you that ultimately makes decisions for the product or things like that. And there are other open source projects that have this structure. None of them have been successful as WordPress. So I think your audience in particular, is great software ever created by committee or does it more often reflects a vision of a leader or something that can allow us to... and I think particularly WordPress not just remaining relevant but actually accelerating growth over huge technological shifts over the past two decades.

(01:03:12):
When we started there was dynamic web apps or DHTML or JavaScript wasn't really a thing, and then the social web and then iPhones and then all this sort of stuff that's changed over time, and we've surfed a lot of these technological changes which is very, very hard to do. Most products do not remain relevant over multiple generational changes like that, and that's been because sometimes we've had to make very unpopular decisions. Gutenberg is a huge part of why WordPress is relevant today, and it's actually an open source project we do. It's the block editor. It's actually bigger than WordPress because it's not just used on WordPress, it's used on every WordPress site, but also like Tumblr, other people. I would actually love if Squarespace or Wix adopted Gutenberg. It's meant to be like a really open source framework.

(01:03:56):
But anyway, if we had voted for whether we should do that or not, everyone would've voted against it or the majority would have. It was really a few core people of us in the community, Matias, myself, other core contributors, Ella, Andrew Ozz, that said, "Hey, this is the future and it's going to take 10 years to do and it's going to be a long bet. It's going to suck for the first three or four years, and so everyone's going to hate it in the beginning."

(01:04:20):
But then later with iteration, we've had I think now 200 releases of Gutenberg. We do sort of a very strict every two weeks release schedule since it started. It's going to get pretty good, and it's at that point now where it's actually getting pretty darn good. And the next phase of it, actually I'm so excited about, it's going to be collaboration. So all the real time co-editing like Google Docs and Notion has, it's coming out to this open source thing, and with the technological changes, we're actually able to do it peer-to-peer. So we don't need a centralized server. We can use WebRTC and other cool technologies.

(01:04:49):
I mean, anyway, I'm going sidelining, but I think that sort of more... and if you look at a lot of great companies, there's a board or whatever but ultimately there's an executive, and some of the most iconic companies of our generations are ones where the executive retains some majority of voting control or other things like that which I've been able to do with Automattic and with WordPress. And I definitely think about succession planning and everything like that, but if or when I'm gone I don't want to pass it to a committee. I want to pass it to someone else who can have a role similar to mine and really sort of try to be a steward.

(01:05:34):
There ultimately is a check and balance on that because, again, the community could leave. They could fork the software. People could change. And so you're "in charge" quote, unquote, but you're also at surface. So it's a lot more being like a mayor than a CEO and that you ultimately are accountable to the folks who are contributing and new users and everything like that. So I do feel like there is a balance there. Some of this as well is that there's some people who aren't part of leadership who feel like they should be. So if you look at the Yoast or Korean things, these are folks who actually don't have commit status. They haven't contributed WordPress over the years and serve our normal hierarchy of the meritocracy of how you get the ability to commit code or things like that. They're like, "Hey, I want to lead a release." That's cool, dude, but there's a process. We have different people lead releases over the years, but they kind of worked their way up to it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):
This makes so much sense to me. That's one of the themes of the podcast, just the power of a singular visionary and leader, founder mode as we've all heard is trending these days.

Matt Mullenweg (01:06:38):
You made famous, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
I wouldn't say that it was. Yeah, Brian shared it, but then Paul Graham pointed afterwards and then I renamed the title of that episode Founder Mode to [inaudible 01:06:49]

Matt Mullenweg (01:06:49):
I really want your [inaudible 01:06:50]

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):
If I zoom out, what I'm sensing here is there's people that have this ideal of how something like this should run, but they've never actually worked at a place where a nonprofit board runs it, runs a thing, and have seen what that actually looks like. And so I think there's a big disconnect between the ideal in theory and how does great stuff get built.

Matt Mullenweg (01:07:11):
And one of the things I think we've tried to demonstrate with WordPress is actually it's kind of like a open source side and a nonprofit side and a for-profit working in concert. And one of the things people don't necessarily appreciate as much about why WordPress has been so successful is because of Automattic and things like Akismet doing anti-spam or WordPress.com having a free version of WordPress that is introduced over a hundred million people to the software in a way that you could just sign up for free. You don't have to pay for hosting or download it yourself or things like that.

(01:07:43):
So that kind of for-profit, nonprofit, open source, working in concert I think is a really interesting model that we're starting to see a lot more companies do. It's actually very exciting to me that some of the things that were controversial when we started open source or distributed work are now the default for so many exciting new startups, and this whole ecosystems of really, really cool open source, like Cal.com for open source Calendly. There's so much cool stuff out there that actually there's a whole generation of younger entrepreneurs that I find very, very inspiring because they're also bringing modern design and web development and everything to open source which is very neat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):
I anticipate a blog post one day, "I told you so, guys." Open source, remote work, I imagine there's a few more things there. There's one other thing I want to address. I haven't seen you talk about this. It comes up a bunch. It's around, this is very the weeds, but I think it's really important to people, and there's something here for a lot of people, the way you guys forked Advanced Custom Fields. So I think what happened here is you guys forked an existing plugin, I think somebody else's plugin, and then kind of pushed people to this plugin versus the original plugin. What can you share there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:08:55):
Yeah, this is very complex. So WordPress.org has kind of like a app store. After WP Engine started suing us, creating millions of dollars of legal fees and things, we blocked their access to WordPress.org. So this plugin they had, Advanced Custom Fields, wasn't able to be updated. At the same time a number of security issues were found in it, including some we reported, and so there had to be an update to it. So we're like, "Okay, we'll ship the update for you essentially." And then we were like, "Okay, I think we need to call it something different because it actually isn't theirs anymore." And they still offer Advanced Custom Fields on their own and people can download it from them, et cetera. So we made Secure Custom Fields which was originally under the same directory listing, so again, because we want all the users of it to get the security updates. This is controversial, and actually they actually got a preliminary injunction, so the judge said "Reverse this." So this has all been reversed by the way.

(01:10:04):
There now is a separate fork under separate listing of Secure Custom Fields which actually we have a team on it, developers, designers, and we're creating... just like WordPress was a fork, we've actually forged this. Actually WooCommerce was a forge. A lot of things are forks. So we forked it and now have a new name, new everything that we're doing a lot of product innovation and improving it. So there's a separate project now and separate directory listing for Secure Custom Fields. That's kind of fast-forward to today. They now have access to WordPress.org again. They have updated the plugin. Everything's back to how it was before, and there's now this separate thing called Secure Custom Fields that the WordPress project is officially supporting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):
So I'm hearing essentially you blocked WP Engine as a part of this, we're just going to simplify WordPress, reduce confusion. They're being bad actors in the space, so we're going to block them, and in that block, there's like a dependency where people couldn't do a thing that they needed to do. So you're like, "And the one that exists, there's a problem with it, so we're going to make that dependence... release a version that you can actually use and fix the security issues."

Matt Mullenweg (01:11:09):
That was the intention. I think that there was a lot of perceptions around it that were different, but yeah, that was the goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):
Okay. Okay. Great. So maybe just the last question. We talked about just a lot of people see you with devil horns these days. They think you're doing bad things and they don't like the approach you're taking. You talked about there's this WP Engine spending a lot of money on PR and hiring this agency. I guess is there anything else that... why do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy? Is it mostly that you think... just where do you think it's coming from? Why are comments always so negative? And we talked a bit about it, but anything more there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:11:46):
I don't know if I can say why. I do think one thing I've learned is that a lot of these things we've talked about are nuanced. So one essentially thing I've learned in this process is that it's hard to explain this stuff in 240 characters or the-

Matt Mullenweg (01:12:00):
... 40 characters. Some mediums do not lend themselves well to discussing this. And so I tried, but I'm participating less in Reddit or Twitter and trying to do more long form things like this, where you can actually have the context and things can't be taken out of context. Also, I think there's something where social networks sometimes are tuned to promote outrage. And it was very interesting. We ran a sentiment analysis recently. We were kind of looking at different social networks, analyzing all the comments, and we found, actually, that the negative, the sort of devil horn fraction on, what was it, like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram was like 8%. It's actually pretty small. On Reddit, it was bigger, I forget the exact number, but on Twitter it was 52%. You're like, whoa, what's going on there?

(01:12:53):
And so there's something in the algorithm, and again, we can't see how the algorithm works or what the incentives are, but it can promote the most controversial things. I think that's not a novel perception. There's a lot of discussion around how social media might be creating more fragmentation in society, and I think this is just an example of that, where when you have networks, when people are getting the majority of the information from social networks, and those networks are not designed to provide nuance or balance, or even promote truth necessarily, misinformation can get spread far more than... What's the saying? Like a lie gets around the world seven times before truth has time to-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):
Get out of bed.

Matt Mullenweg (01:13:31):
Get out of bed, yeah. There's been a lot of that. So there's actually been a lot of misinformation, untrue things that go viral, and then the untrue thing gets like 700,000 views, and the correction gets like 20,000 views. So there's been some of that happening. When mainstream media has covered this, it's actually been a lot better. So there's been some actually really good articles in some business publications and other things that sort of look at a more nuanced and balanced view. And I think the podcast have been pretty good, but definitely on Twitter, I think you can get a version of all of this that is both, I think, not entirely true and also pretty more negative.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):
Yeah. I imagine people are going to be like, "Lenny, you didn't ask him this thing. Here's the thing he said that I want to learn more about." I'm sure I missed some stuff, but from an outsider's perspective, this all make sense. There's a company, I don't think PE companies are bad innately, but their job is buy a company and make it run more efficiently, and then oftentimes sell it for more. So it makes sense that they buy a company, make it more efficient, cut some corners, don't put a lot of effort into making it awesome, even though I'm sure there's awesome people working in there, trying really hard to make it great. And basically what I'm feeling is they got to a point where this is hurting the ecosystem. They're feeling really dishonest with working with you, and there's a stalling technique. And so, makes sense to me why you just have to stand up and fight back. And it's hard, it's hard to do that. Is there anything else along this thread before we move on to a different topic, anything else you want to share before we close out this chapter?

Matt Mullenweg (01:15:15):
Well, if people have more questions, they can come to WordCamp Asia. We're going to do an open Q&A there. We do town halls in the WordPress.org Community. There's a Slack people can get on and ask questions. So there is kind of a lot of open ways to engage, and I'm definitely happy to do that. I'm probably not going to do it on Twitter as much, but when there's longer form opportunities to have a discussion here, particularly if it's more like real time, like this, I'm very happy to.

(01:15:43):
And that's why if you look at it, there's actually a big difference. WP Engine has not done any podcasts and no press. They don't respond to journalists, they don't talk about this. And I've done the opposite, where I'm really trying to be out there and engaged. And everyone's like, "Why don't you just let the lawyers do the talking?" And it's like, well, but we have community, and also I feel like we're in the right. So when you're in the wrong, you probably say only have the lawyers talk. When you're in the right, I think you should be out there and telling the story.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):
I remember at the end of your WordCamp talk, you were like, "Any questions?" after this big controversial talk, and I'm curious how it felt. All the questions initially were nothing to do with this. It's what it felt like. You're just like, oh, they already had these questions. They didn't even know what you said maybe, and I bet you're just like, wait, did anyone hear what I just said? Did it feel like that?

Matt Mullenweg (01:16:28):
Well, also, that's really like a WordPress community event, so it's a lot of the core developers and things, so they have WordPress questions, so that is something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):
You're like, hello.

Matt Mullenweg (01:16:38):
I've now done hundreds and hundreds of these town halls and QAs, and I really enjoy it because you never know what's going to come up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:42):
Yeah, okay. I want to talk about all the companies that you bought and will buy in the future. It's kind of like you're building a little Berkshire Hathaway. I think you've described it that way. It's kind of what it's feeling like. And Tumblr is really interesting. Until I started prepping for this, I didn't even know you guys own Tumblr. I haven't heard this story. Why did you guys buy Tumblr? What is going on with Tumblr? It was like a big deal back in the day. What is the current state of Tumblr? What is the story there?

Matt Mullenweg (01:17:10):
Oh, Tumblr is so interesting. At the time, I think it was one of our best competitors. They created this really amazing sort of hybrid of blogging and social networking. And if you kind of zoom back, a lot of things that are now standard on other social networks, even the ability to embed an image with a post, again, it was not supported originally on Twitter and other things. Remember they used to have, what was it, like tweet image, or you have to linked out to other things to post an image to Twitter. It wasn't native functionality, and Tumblr had these multiple post types. You could post a chat, an image. They were, I think, one of the first to support video, so they did a lot of, I think, product innovation under the leadership of David Karp, who's a really amazing entrepreneur and product leader.

(01:17:54):
Funny story, both David and I were at CNET at the same time. They had hired both of us.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):
What an alumni group at CNET.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:02):
They could have kept both of us probably. But anyway, the Tumblr, I forget the year, but they sold, I think the same time that Instagram did, for a similar amount, $1.1 billion.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):
To you or to someone else?

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:16):
Instagram bought by Facebook, obviously.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):
Right, right. Tumblr.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:20):
And Tumblr bought by Yahoo.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):
Oh, wow.

Matt Mullenweg (01:18:22):
Who was at the time, again, Yahoo, we don't think about it now, but I feel a little old. But at the time, Yahoo was one of the internet giants and had recently Marissa Mayer, who was one of the big early people at Google, I think part of creating the API program and everything like that, was the CEO of Yahoo. This was, I think, one of her first big acquisitions.

(01:18:46):
Now subsequently, obviously ,we know how Instagram went. I think people were like, "I can't believe you bought this for a billion dollars." And obviously now it's worth hundreds of billions. So that's had a really good trajectory. At Yahoo, I think things became more challenged. So again, this is a little bit of history, but Yahoo then had this thing where they owned part of Alibaba, which then became more valuable than the rest of the company. They had activist investors. I think they had some CEO switches. I think Marissa Mayer leaves or gets fired at some point. There's all this turnover, and I think Tumblr really languished under their ownership. And from what I can understand, the team was actually held back a lot from things they wanted to launch or ways they wanted to iterate. Then Yahoo merges with AOL, which is another kind of early internet thing. That goes for a little while. So again, then Tumblr's just kind of stuck underneath this stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:43):
Tumbling along.

Matt Mullenweg (01:19:45):
Tumbling along. And then that gets bought by Verizon. So fast-forward to 2019. Verizon wants to get rid of Tumblr. And so they're kind of putting it up for sale and had a number of bidders. Automattic ended up buying it for a de minimis amount. I think it's been reported we bought it for $3 million.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:10):
What a deal. 3 million.

Matt Mullenweg (01:20:14):
But obviously, that represented a lot of value destruction over the years. Tumblr had had some tough times. They actually were banned from the App Store at one point for not moderating things well enough and having maybe a little too much porn. Obviously, Twitter [inaudible 01:20:31] porn. They maybe were a little too out there with it, and we're doing a good job filtering it and keeping away from App Store reviewers or whatever. And so Verizon, to their credit though, there were people bidding more. Actually I think a porn company was bidding on Tumblr that would've paid a lot more money. They really were looking for an acquirer that they felt like would be a good steward. From my point of view, I had such incredible respect for Tumblr as a product. And the community, still, despite all of this sort of stuff that had happened, I think at that point still was like, I forget the exact number, but call it 15, 20 million monthly active users.

(01:21:14):
So really, sort of active core. And one of the things that's so fascinating is over half of that user base was under the age of 25. And actually had a huge, I think, it was like 25 or 30% LGBT+. I think a very unique place on the internet, where people could have a social network where they could be anonymous, they could put on different identities, they could be someplace their parents weren't, like Facebook or Instagram, really still could take a special spot. So we ended up buying it. Now, people are like, "Oh, you bought it for $3 million." But we bought it sort of taking on all liabilities, including, I think they were under investigation by the FTC, there were lawsuits. There was all this sort of stuff. So it was free like a puppy, not free like-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
Free like beer.

Matt Mullenweg (01:22:05):
Had a pretty big team, I think 185 people. We were taking a lot of burners, burning a ton of cash, and that was 2019. And so, it's been, I think, a humbling experience running a social network. It was very, very different from all the other products that we've done. And I think there's some incredible things about Tumblr and that I'm still very excited about. So where WordPress has primarily a desktop and web user base, Tumblr is obviously like 85% app-based, has a younger demographic. And so part of the vision that now we're executing on is actually we wanted to create a path for people using Tumblr to actually it being powered by WordPress on the back end. So Tumblr users could unlock themes, customization, plugins, et cetera. Actually, we're in the process right now of migrating the half a billion Tumblr sites to WordPress, probably one of the largest data migrations-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:58):
That makes sense.

Matt Mullenweg (01:23:00):
... that's happened in a while. So we're kind of trying to do this in a way that's invisible to users on the front end, so changing at the back end while maintaining the APIs and the interface and everything. So it's a fun engineering project. I kind of posted this kind of call to arms, got a lot of fun people applying for Automattic, and we hired a lot of great folks around this sort of audacious project, this big hairy audacious goal. And so that's where it's at now. I've sort of ran it personally for a few years while we're doing turnarounds, but there's a great team there, but still challenged, still not profitable, so we're still subsidizing it from the rest of Automattic's businesses. Fortunately, the rest of our business have done really well, so we were able to do that, but I definitely want to get to a place where it's sustainable.

(01:23:46):
And one of the things we're also experimenting with is can Tumblr have not just an advertising-driven model? I think ultimately the incentives of advertising social networks can lead to the kind of dynamics that you see on the more negative side of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, et cetera. And so really trying to create a subscription model or a sort of first-party user-driven advertising, where you promote your blog posts or something like that, or you promote a WooCommerce product or something, where it's not a third-party ad ecosystem, which I think has a lot of weird code and malware and lots of stuff I don't love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
Wow, sounds like a lot you took on with this acquisition, and I love that you said you ran it initially. So this is a good segue to maybe my last question. I'm curious where this goes. Just how do you... Well, let me zoom out. There's a lot of people these days that are excited about roll of businesses. I'm going to buy a bunch of companies, make them better, make them awesome, save money, and then just keep building this holding company sort of thing. You guys are doing that, and it's working well. What do you look for? How do you decide a company's right for Automattic? What are the factors that are like, we should buy this, we can turn this around and turn it into a big success?

Matt Mullenweg (01:24:58):
I don't know if I would do another turnaround like Tumblr again, or at least not for many, many years. It's definitely a different thing. The vast majority of things we acquire, it's simply something that's done well, and we want to accelerate it, or sometimes acqui-hires, where we're plugging it into one of our existing projects, or we're taking the team and putting them on something we're already doing. So it's a really talented team. Tumblr, I think we ended up ultimately replacing 85, 90% of the team as well. So that's just very different. So I do think there are different ways of doing it, but if you look at our other acquisitions like Day One, et cetera, founder's still here, many years later, we're accelerating stuff like that. We brought it to Android, we're bringing it to it to web. It's more of taking something good and making it better. And probably our best example there is WooCommerce, which was a small company, I think 35, 40 people, based out of South Africa, and has obviously grown to... Again, I said Automattic makes about half a billion dollars a year now, and WooCommerce is a majority of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):
Speaking of that, actually, you haven't shared the revenue number. I know it's public. Just give people a sense of Automattic's revenue. Can you just share those numbers? Because I think it might blow people's minds.

Matt Mullenweg (01:26:15):
Yeah, I think we say publicly it's about a half a billion dollars in sort of ARR revenue right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:20):
Incredible. Okay. I have a question for you. It's kind of a hot seat question. As you talked, I wonder, I feel like people are thinking of this. So you've been talking about PE companies being often bad. You're buying Tumblr. You've talked about laying off a bunch of people, turning it all around. How's that different from a PE company, Matt?

Matt Mullenweg (01:26:39):
Yeah, and I agree with you that just because it's private equity doesn't mean it's bad. And also, something people say is like, "Hey, wait, don't you have private equity investors as well at Automattic?" And we do. Now, they own usually a small percentage, sometimes under 1%, and they don't have control of the company. So I think there's a distinguish. Is it a minority investment or a control investment? And with WP Engine, Silver Lake controls the company. And when they control the company, I think there's a spectrum of actions. Obviously, being more efficient is great, and we should all strive for that. And I think every business does, whether it's private equity or our business or things that are founder controlled. You always want to be more efficient. Now, there's some spectrum there where you over-optimize, or you could have dark patterns. Right now on WP Engine, it's very difficult to cancel your accounts. Actually, I think as of today, 45,000 sites have left, so they're, I think, down to 600. Yeah, well, because their customers have realized like, "Hey, this isn't WordPress, this isn't..." or, "They're suing the guy who started WordPress, so maybe we should not support this commercially." So we have the site wordpressenginetracker.com that sort of shows in real time the sites that are leaving. It's kind of an exciting thing to see that number tick up. Actually, maybe a good example as well, even though there's a lot of negativity, you actually look at how people are voting with their wallets. They're leaving.

(01:28:07):
So I think you have to judge as well, just look at the track record. So one of the things I'm very proud of with Automattic is we are an acquirer of first resort, and we have founders that have sold to us. Paul Mayne at Day One is a great example that didn't need to sell. They're wildly profitable, could have run it himself for a long, long time, but people choose to join because they feel like we'll be good stewards of it in the future, and ultimately just have to look at the track record.

(01:28:36):
So I think don't judge it by what it's called, judge it by the actions over time. And I hope to continue building that reputation for a place that's a good steward of communities and software and everything else for many years to come.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:52):
Matt, we covered so much. I asked you all the hard questions and more. Before we wrap up, is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with? Any last thoughts, comments, insights, stories?

Matt Mullenweg (01:29:04):
Yeah, follow me. I'm at photomatt, P-H-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, on Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, everything like that. I post a lot about other stuff. I post a lot about AI and open source and other things. Some WordPress things in there as well. I have these life missions to democratize publishing and commerce. We added a new one last year, which is messaging, so it's in beta mode right now, but relaunching in a few months as a product called Beeper, which takes all your Telegram, Instagram DMs, Signal, everything, brings it all into one app. And you can do some really cool stuff like that, and especially when you start to imagine search or AI, local AI around that. So very, very excited about that relaunch. So I encourage people to, you check out the beta now, go to beeper.com/beta to get the new version, and we're going to relaunch that later in the year.

(01:29:50):
So yeah, I'm very excited about that. It's kind of fun to be working on something that's at the stage where WordPress was in 2003, 2004. So WordPress is quite mature at this point. WooCommerce is kind of where WordPress was in 2010. And then the Beeper stuff, the messaging stuff is where we were in 2003. So one thing that keeps me excited is working at different stages of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):
This feels like a reason to be doing your approach to Berkshire Hathaway is just stay active in early stage stuff and not just optimize established things. So it's beeper.com, by the way, awesome domain name. Photomatt, what's the story of photomatt? You're into photography, I imagine, is the story?

Matt Mullenweg (01:30:32):
Yeah, it's a little bit of a pun. So a fotomatt is also, F-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, is a place that you would go to develop your photos back when you would have film and develop things. So originally my username was Saxmatt because I played the saxophone. Sometimes people mishear that. And also, I started traveling so much. There's been years I do like 400,000 miles of air travel, because I go around the world to go to WordPress events and meet the community. And as a distributed company, we do lots of meetups. And so, it became hard to carry my saxophone around. So my method of artistic expression became photography, and that's actually kind of how WordPress started, was actually originally a site where I could share my photos before Flickr, before Facebook and everything like that, sort of use this gallery software, actually open source gallery software, PHP software, to sort of share all the photos I was taking.

(01:31:25):
And actually now on my website, I think I have over 38,000 photos I posted. And yeah, it's still one of the things I really love. So it's also a username that was available everywhere, and I still do it. So I'm actually going to the Maha Kumbh Mela, the big 300-million-person gathering at the Ganges River in a few weeks. And one, I'm just excited to experience that, it happens every 12 years, but two, I'm just really excited to take some time to do photography. And yeah, I really enjoy it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:56):
You forgot to mention your website and your blog, your WordPress site itself, where you blog. Ma.tt, is the domain, which is amazing. I will point people to one of my favorite ritual you have on your blog, which is you share what's in your bag, you talk about how you travel all this, and I think every year you're like, here's the gadgets I use most and bring with me everywhere.

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:18):
It's my most popular post of the year by far.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:20):
I'm not surprised. You need an Amazon, just buy everything button. Yeah, because basically you're just trying to optimize for the least weight and most utility, right, out of all these gadgets that you're bringing with the on trips.

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:33):
Yeah, actually weighing it is something I just started doing this year because my bag actually got really heavy, got like 35 pounds or something. And so, some friends were like, "Hey, why don't we weigh everything and just go through." So now I'm posting the weights.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:45):
Oh my god. Okay. Anyway, we'll point people to that. Matt, thank you so much for doing this. This was awesome,

Matt Mullenweg (01:32:50):
Lenny, thank you so much. And I really appreciate the ability to discuss these things in a longer form. And also just your audience. Oh, I guess final thing I'll say is we're hiring a ton. So you have one of the most incredible audiences in the world. I recommend your podcast and newsletter to a lot of my colleagues. And so, if you're someone who loves this kind of stuff, I think there's a big opportunity at Automattic to have an impact on these things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:11):
What roles are you hiring for most and where do people find these roles?

Matt Mullenweg (01:33:15):
Automattic.com, A-U-T-O-M-A-T-T-I-C. There's a Work with Us page. You can kind of see how we work. We're fully distributed and can manage that forever. We sort of started that. Another interesting thing is we actually pay the same salaries globally. So whether you're in California or Italy or Nigeria or wherever, we pay global salaries. So yeah, a lot of opportunities, and we're hiring for kind of everything, I would say, but particularly people with great design or product skills is probably one of the areas that you can have the biggest impact at Automattic right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:53):
