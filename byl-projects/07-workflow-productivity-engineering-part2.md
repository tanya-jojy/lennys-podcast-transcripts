# Are your fears giving you terrible advice? | Matt Mochary

## Transcript

Matt Mochary (00:00:00):
The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on to Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera, because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You don't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. And of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. So, that's the most important thing.

Lenny (00:01:08):

Lenny (00:04:43):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matt Mochary (00:04:47):
Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:04:49):
I am looking forward to it even more. The way I learned about you is back in the day I read this book called The Great CEO Within, which I have right here, and I was like, holy moly, this is the most tactical, practical, useful book I've seen for leaders. I need to tell everyone about it, and I did. Then a few weeks ago, someone shared a link in my newsletter Slack community to this document that is called the Mochary Method Curriculum Document. I was like, oh my god, this is the most practical, tactical, useful document I've seen in a long time. I got to share this with everyone, and I did. Then I realized it's the same person that wrote these two things, and so I reached out to you and you kindly agreed to join me on this podcast. And so again, really appreciate you being here.

Matt Mochary (00:05:30):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny (00:05:32):
Give folks a little bit of background on you who aren't so familiar with you, and just to help understand a little bit of a how you got so wise. Can you give folks just kind of a brief overview of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career, maybe some of the folks you've worked with and how you got to what you do now?

Matt Mochary (00:05:47):
Right on. I've had a very varied career. I started a company back in internet 1.0 called Totality, which was a good financial outcome. Then I went and just had fun for a long time and then I went and did social good and helped ex-convicts get and keep a job by becoming truck drivers. All that was super fun, but I realized I missed my peers and I wanted to get back into the tech world, but I didn't want to start a company because a company is a lot of work and the end result is you make a lot of money, but I didn't need money.

Matt Mochary (00:06:15):
And so I thought, how could I get in the tech world and not actually have to do the hard work? Oh, I could be a coach. I could coach people and then I just get to do the fun stuff and advise them and then they have to do the hard work. And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms.

Matt Mochary (00:07:07):
It's been a ton of fun and for me, I do things for joy and each and every one of these interactions has been massively joyful for me and the people I coach become my really close friends, so it's all very selfish on my part.

Lenny (00:07:21):
I feel you on a lot of that. I also tried to explore starting a company again and similarly decided this is way too much stress and work, what else can I do instead? And that's what led to the work I do now, which I love.

Matt Mochary (00:07:33):
Right on.

Lenny (00:07:34):
How long have you been doing this coaching?

Matt Mochary (00:07:36):
That whole process started about 10 years ago, so about 10 years.

Lenny (00:07:40):
Awesome. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and the internet and ahead of this chat I polled folks on Twitter and asked them what they would ask you if they were chatting with you, so I thought I'd start off with asking you a few those questions and then we'll dig into a few very specific topics that I'm excited to talk about. The first question comes from Leo Polovets who's a GP at Susa Ventures, and he asked, "Matt has coached some incredible founders, what are some of the most common areas where even the most successful founders still struggle?"

Matt Mochary (00:08:11):
Great question. To me, the bar is fear and how strongly do people feel fear? There are few people that I coach that just don't feel fear at all. And frankly with them, we have very tactical conversations, but they're the minority. The most feel fear to some degree, some feel it a lot, some feel it less, but when they feel it grips their mind and it prevents them from seeing... It prevents them from doing the thing that is difficult but necessary, so that's a lot of what our coaching is, me pointing out to them, hey, I think you're in fear.

Matt Mochary (00:08:55):
What happens is very early on in coaching they'll go, yeah, okay, I'm in fear. So what? I go, great. I believe that fear is actually giving you bad advice and I think you're predicting that if you do this A will happen. Well, I'm predicting that if you do that, the exact opposite will happen. So, I'll tell you what, why don't we make a bet? This is very high stakes, why don't we pick something that's lower stakes? You make a prediction, we'll see if I make the opposite and then let's bet on it. So we pick something and then we make a bet on it, and whoever wins the bet in the future gets to determine what the actions are.

Matt Mochary (00:09:31):
I've made this bet hundreds of times and so far, I've never lost. It's not because I'm magician or a genius, it's because when someone's in fear, they're gripped. They can't see reality, their brain is making very exaggerated predictions. Whereas when someone is not in fear, and I'm not because it's not my situation, I am not gripped and therefore, my brain isn't making exaggerated predictions. And so, we make this bet once I win, then all of a sudden the CEO realizes, oh my God, there's something to this, fear gives bad advice. Then after that, all I need to do is remind the person that I perceive them to be in fear. That's all it takes, and they're like, oh, okay, and then they go ahead and do the thing that they feel fear about. Then of course, later they come back to me and say, Matt, that was magical. It works so well.

Matt Mochary (00:10:23):
I mean, I'll give you examples. The most extreme is when a CEO realizes that there's a problem in the business and they haven't told their board yet and their board doesn't know, and remember, their board is their investors, and they have another round coming up, they know they're going to have to raise money in another six to 12 months. They need their current investors to participate in the upcoming round, otherwise outside investors won't. Then they say, well, what the hell do I do? I've got this problem. Do I tell my investors? And most often, the knee jerk reaction is, no, I'm not going to tell them.

Matt Mochary (00:11:01):
Then I say, "Well, I think that's fear. I think if you actually tell them, tell your investors, the exact opposite of what we think is going to happen is going to happen. You think you're going to lose their trust. I think you're going to gain their trust." And so, if we've done this fear exercise before, they do it, they share transparently with their board all the problems and say, and I'm excited to tackle these problems. Every single time that's happened, the board members have said, "This is fantastic. I love this honesty. Thank you so much. This is one of the only companies that I'm on the board of that actually is transparent and honest," and they gain trust.

Lenny (00:11:42):
I'm glad that you brought this topic up. I wanted to spend time on it. Just to double click a little bit into it, just kind of to summarize your advice here, if you feel fear, which you may not recognize you feel, the advice is: do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do, right?

Matt Mochary (00:11:57):
Generally, I mean, check with someone. Don't just randomly, I feel fear crossing the street crossing a crowded highway and then go, oh, that's fear talking. I should cross the highway anyway and then get hit by a cop. No, that's not what I mean. I don't mean physical danger, I mean things that we perceive to be danger to our egos, but that the easiest thing is just to check with somebody else who's not in fear because they will be able to see clearly when you can't.

Lenny (00:12:24):
I was working through your curriculum and you pointed out that you found a way to express to somebody that they are in fear. I think it was your wife that kind of iterated on how to give you feedback that you're in fear where you didn't get defensive, you got more fearful and angry and can you talk a bit about that?

Matt Mochary (00:12:40):
Yeah, so we iterated, I at times feel anger and I act on that anger and I don't even realize I'm in anger, so I wanted her to let me know, and so she would say, at first she said, "You're in anger," and that just made me feel accused and made me go into more anger. And then she said, "Are you in anger?" And that felt passive aggressive or indirect and that also made me go into more anger. Then finally she said, "I perceive you to be an anger." So it's an I statement and it's simply what she's perceiving. There's no judgment. That was able to punch through my anger and then I woke up and went, oh, and then I stopped and just didn't act until I was able to shift out of anger.

Lenny (00:13:25):
Awesome. And anger and fear, I think there's different pieces of advice for if you feel angry versus fear. Is that right?

Matt Mochary (00:13:32):
Yes. I mean, anger, you're just destroying and what you're doing is you're destroying relationships and so you just got to stop because you're breaking glass. Of course, you're breaking it with the people who are closest to you. They're the people who are nearest to you, which are the people you love and care about the most. They're not only people you work with, but they're the people you live with and you don't want to do that. You don't want to hurt them.

Lenny (00:13:59):
Yeah. Maybe one last question along these lines, why do we do this? Is this just we're trying to protect our ego and ourselves and we just want to do the safe thing?

Matt Mochary (00:14:06):
That's it. I mean, I just learned very recently, and this isn't written anywhere because I just learned it, someone shared with me that anger is not a base emotion. Anger is actually a cover. It's a cover for when we feel pain, and so our brain doesn't want to feel the pain, so instead it externalizes it. But the problem is it shoves that pain onto everybody else around us. The real answer here is not to have people let us know that we're in anger and then stop. The real answer is just to allow ourselves to feel the pain and it sucks by the way, it actually hurts. But then we're not... Sorry, I'm getting emotional. We're not pushing that out onto other people and I only learned this very recently and I'm just starting to practice this and I'm still not good at it, but I'm now at least sometimes not going to anger.

Lenny (00:15:02):
It's interesting how personal this advice is that it sounds like something that you deal with. It's not just like you're this coach that's just like, hey guys, here's all these problems you have. Here's how you fix stuff that you help yourself with.

Matt Mochary (00:15:15):
I'm human. Yes, and that's why I try to figure it out with me and if I can figure something out with me, then I can share it with others.

Lenny (00:15:24):
Amazing. That was a fruitful question from Leo, and we might come back to this topic.

Matt Mochary (00:15:30):
By the way, this also applies to organizations. I mean, the way that I used to get all this information about how to run organizations is I started a company, Totality, and my co-founder and I, we did a terrible job running that company. What happened was I didn't have any learnings from that which I could share with people because it was just worst practices, not best practices. But then 10 years later, I thought to myself, well, how could I have done that better? How could we have done that better?

Matt Mochary (00:15:55):
So, I picked up a book, a business book, it was High Output Management by Andy Grove. I read it and I was like, "Oh my God, here are all the answers." And then I read another book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz was like, "Oh my God, there are even more answers." I just kept reading more and more business books, and every one I read, they were just chock full of answers. But then I needed to test whether or not these really worked, so that's when I started coaching and I started testing them in companies, but I had to let the people know here, do this, but they weren't going to read a 350 page book. I had to summarize it in two pages and then share it with them, and then they did, and then they implemented it and it worked.

Matt Mochary (00:16:29):
Then I had all these summaries, and then I started to create my own summaries of little niche cases that weren't in any book that I'd read. That's where all these writings came from. Then one day, someone that I was coaching said, "Matt, you got to take all these writings. They're a book, you got to publish them." And I said, "No, I don't." My friend said, "Well, how about I do all the work? How about I take care of the editing and the publishing?" And I was like, "Okay, if you want to do that, great." That was Alex MacCaw. Others had offered before, but he was the one that actually followed through all the way to the end. That was it. That's how the book was born.

Matt Mochary (00:17:06):
But I realized also, recently, that many of my most radical ideas, I can't get anyone to test them because I'll say, "Hey, I think you should do blank." And the CEO will say, "That sounds crazy. Matt, can you point me to other examples of other people that have done this and it's worked?" And I say, "No, this is an original thought that came out of my head. No one's done it before that I know of." They're like, "Okay, well I'm not going to be the first."

Matt Mochary (00:17:33):
Then I realized I needed an organization to test my most radical ideas, and also all of my CEOs had been asking me to create software because I have a methodology and it's step one, step two, step three, and you do it in one-on-ones and then a methodology for a team meeting and then a methodology for feedback and then a methodology for every different motion in the company. It's all in Google Docs. And they said to me, "Matt, this is amazing. I love this one-on-one process. I love your team process, but I don't want to have to teach each of my reports the way you've taught me. I'd like it just being softer. I just hit a button and boom, it happens automatically." At first, I said, "No, that's not interesting to me. I'm not a developer. You, Brian Armstrong, you're a developer and you have a thousand engineers that work for you. Why don't you go create it?"

Matt Mochary (00:18:21):
But in the end, I said, "Okay, this could be fun." So, I hired a team of developers and we started to create the software, and one, the product is working. But two more importantly, I now have a team of humans that we work together that I can start testing my more radical ideas out with. I would say about half of them are wildly successful and the other half complete duds. It almost seems like one are the other. But now I have my own basically laboratory to test things. Of course, when I see radical things that other people are doing, I try them in our organization, and it's phenomenal.

Matt Mochary (00:18:59):
I'll tell you the most radical one. I was asking one CEO, I said, "Have you ever let someone go and regretted it?" He said, "No." And I said, "Well, then you don't know what the bar is because the bar of where you should be letting people go is here, and the bar that you've let people go is here. So until you get close to that line, you don't know what that line is." He said, "Wow, that's true." Then I thought about it and I thought to myself, uh-oh, I have never let anyone go that I regret it, so I don't know where the line is.

Matt Mochary (00:19:34):
Then I thought, oh no, I've got to go into my team and let someone go, and here's the problem. We've already done talent density, we've already done the Netflix thing. If someone is meeting expectation, we let them go. We've already let all those folks go. So on our team, it's only outperformers. So, I thought there was one guy, he's an outperformer, no question about it, and super positive, an amazing guy and can do anything and is happy to do everything. But there wasn't much left for him to do because everything else was being covered. I talked to my number two and said, "Can you do what you're doing and what he's doing?" And she said, "Give me two weeks," and she did. She came back and said, "Yeah, I can." So, we let him go.

Matt Mochary (00:20:19):
Now, when I let someone go, I try to do it with a massive amount of compassion because I know it's brutal. I mean, losing your spouse, your home, and your job, these are the three most traumatic things that can happen to you. When that happens, of course you go into massive fear and the brain shuts down, so I want to be there and help them through that process and actively help them find their dream job because there is a place that absolutely needs them. So, what I do is I become their agent and I say, "I want to help you discover what it is that your ideal role is, and I want to help you create it or land it." I did that with him. Turns out, what he wanted to do was go start a company and create a new product so he could just start that day one. But, the litmus for me is that everybody I've let go, I believe anyway, that I continue to be friends with. That shows me that the process by which I let people go is a humane one.

Matt Mochary (00:21:17):
Here's the crazy thing, after letting this guy go, after about 30 days, I was like, ugh, did I do the wrong thing? Was that too much? But then after about two to three months, I realized, no, that actually was the right thing because my number two was able to absorb the things that he was doing and here's the crazy part, with fewer people in the organization, things work better. That's the big realization that most people never discover. they hit product market fit, they get tons of money from investors, just higher, higher, higher, higher, but every additional human you have in your organization causes extra overhead and geometrically so, because now you have to keep all those people informed, give them all context, make them all feel heard, because unless they feel like they're contributing and you understand what they're saying, then they feel ignored and they feel passed over and they feel disrespected and grumpy.

Matt Mochary (00:22:11):
There's this morale problem that exists. There's this friction of information flow and a morale problem that grows and grows and grows. Really, the only answer is, I mean, that's why people bring me in because they're growing, growing, growing, and things are breaking. I have a system that keeps things together, but it doesn't make it perfect. It just makes it so that the company doesn't fall apart. But really the ideal is just to keep the team super small. That's what WhatsApp did, that's what Instagram did, that's what Linear is doing right now. That's what Notion has been doing for a while. Those, to me, are the real success stories.

Lenny (00:22:53):
This reminds me of a story I just listened to on Lex Fridman's podcast. They were interviewing the head of AI at Tesla, or former head of AI, and Lex was asking him, "Why did you get rid of LiDAR on your cars? Like aren't more sensors good so that you can be better at self-driving?" And he's like, "If you have LiDAR, you got to think about the supply chain and getting all those parts. You got to think about all the additional data that it brings and adds more chaos to your data, and you have to think about that. Think about if that one part is gone, everything slows down, and in theory it is better, but then all these other factors end up making it worse." Talking about how Elon's philosophy is the best part is no part. It feels like that's exactly what you're saying.

Matt Mochary (00:23:36):
That's right.

Lenny (00:23:37):
You're getting to all the stuff I want to talk about, which is awesome. So firing people, this is good. We were chatting earlier and you mentioned that this is a skill that most managers are really bad at and maybe is the most important skill to develop as a leader and as a manager. People are just bad at it. You shared a few pieces of advice there, but is there anything else that you could share about just how to get better at firing people and that skill?

Matt Mochary (00:24:03):
Yeah, the reason people are bad at this is because they think that they're hurting the person who they're letting go. I mean, how many times have I heard from someone, "Yeah, this person's not performing, but gosh, they really need this job and their mother has cancer," and whatever personal situation they're in. Wei Deng, who is the CEO of Clipboard Health, who's one of my favorite CEOs, who frankly I learn more from her than she learns from me, she shared with me her framework for making decisions, which is she separates the decision from the implementation, meaning she thinks about who is the stakeholder here that I'm solving for? And almost always in a company, you're solving for the customer. So, what would the customer want to see happen? That's the decision. Of course, the customer would want to see only the best employees and anyone who isn't a great employee, don't be there.

Matt Mochary (00:24:52):
Now the implementation is, if I do this, if I let this person go, who gets hurt? Well, the employee gets hurt. Maybe I get hurt because it's a painful conversation. Maybe the rest of the team gets hurt because they're sad that their friend is leaving. Then you look at, well, what can we do? Each person who gets hurt, what is it that they really want? Let's see if we can help them get what they really want. Well, the person let go, what do they want? They want a great job where they're actually needed and they feel fulfilled, so they enjoy what they're doing and they're actually critical to the company or organization that they're with. Right now they're not, by the way, they're not critical, clearly. So you're actually holding them back from what it is that they really want.

Matt Mochary (00:25:36):
What you do is you help them find that place that really needs the skill or the passion that they have. Yourself, what do you really want? You want to not have a difficult conversation? Well, cognitive behavior therapy, the best way to get over that is to actually have one and realize it's not that bad. Then the rest of the team, they feel sad because their teammate left. Well, here's how you solve what they really want is they want to know that... They want to release their emotions. Okay, great. Listen to them, let them share their emotions, let them share the sadness that they feel, and then it's released out of their body.

Matt Mochary (00:26:12):
Decision is one thing, implementation is completely and utterly separate. That's the same thing here in letting someone go. But if you let them go kindly and humanely, the key is, in my opinion, you become their agent, like Michael Ovitz, the CAA agent. You help them find their next job actively. Michael Ovitz is the one who reaches out to employers for his clients and says, "Hey, do you have work for my client?" That's what I mean by being agent, not by, if you need a reference from me, I'll be happy to give you reference. That's bullshit, that's passive.

Matt Mochary (00:26:50):
I'm talking about active, and it doesn't take long. Maybe one to two hours of my time reaching out to people I know saying, "Hey, I've got this great person." Oh my God, of course they're going to pay attention. Of course, they're going to react. Now you might say, well, wait a second, what if the person isn't great? What if they're a bad performer and my posit is that they're good at something. You have to find out what it is they're good at. And really what they're good at is what they're passionate about, so find out what they're passionate about and that you can recommend them for. That's what I do.

Matt Mochary (00:27:25):
I think for almost all managers that aren't good at letting go, it's because A, they've never done it, or B, they've done it badly. They didn't help the person, and that person then went off and had a very painful time and now hates that manager. But if you actively help that person, they will appreciate it. Now, there are situations when a person says, "Screw you, I don't want your help." Okay, but they still recognize that you offered.

Lenny (00:27:56):
Who's the best person at firing that comes to mind when you think of this person's really good at this?

Matt Mochary (00:28:01):
Wei Deng from Clipboard Health. She's the most compassionate.

Lenny (00:28:07):
Awesome. The framework you shared reminds me of something my manager once taught me similarly. They missed the final piece of actually being their agent and finding their next gig, but just the idea of separate the emotion and doing the thing from, if there were no feelings involved, what would you do? And then you should do that, and that might be hard.

Matt Mochary (00:28:26):
That's exactly right. By the way, this whole thing about no feelings, I do have probably two CEOs that don't feel emotions. They don't feel fear, they don't feel anger. One, in particular, feels zero emotions. I have to say, he's a machine, he's an operating machine and there's zero time between ah, this is the right thing to do and doing it. It's amazing. It's an incredibly well run company and an incredibly valuable company. So yeah, emotions typically, again, typically fear and anger are the ones that derail our brains.

Lenny (00:29:08):
It makes me think of Alex Honnold, I think is his name, the free climber, the solo dude. His amygdala doesn't quite function so he doesn't-

Matt Mochary (00:29:19):
That's right.

Lenny (00:29:21):
That's interesting. He could be a free solo climber, he could be a CEO.

Matt Mochary (00:29:25):
That's right. CEO's a little safer. The prediction for Alex is that he will at some point, unfortunately die.

Lenny (00:29:33):
Yeah. Did you see The Alpinist? Not to spoil anything.

Matt Mochary (00:29:36):
Yes.

Lenny (00:29:38):
Okay, moving on from that, I'm curious, in a remote world, does your advice change in terms of firing? It seems like everything you shared you could do easily in person or remote, but does something change when you're doing it over Zoom?

Matt Mochary (00:29:51):
No, it doesn't change at all. There is one point I didn't include, which I'll include now, is there's helping the person be their agent, but there's also allowing the person, whenever I have a difficult conversation, I start it off, "Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this." What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard because if they're aware that they're going to go into fear, they're going to go into anger, they're going to go into sadness, then they can see it coming and they go, oh, that's what it is. But if they don't see it coming, just a surprise and all of a sudden it grips their whole brain and now they're in it and they don't even know they're in it.

Matt Mochary (00:30:43):
That's the first thing I do. This is going to be a difficult conversation. Are you ready? Then I share the news. I'm letting you go, here's why. Then second, I deliver the message. The third thing is now they're feeling emotions, strong ones. Even though I warned them, they're still feeling them. Now you want them to be able to release those emotions, and so I say to them, "My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?" Sometimes they don't answer, but many times they do and they share with me and they let it out. That's important to allow them to let it out. Then I make them feel heard and I actively listen. That makes them realize that I'm not trying to run away from the pain that they're feeling. I'm not trying to leave them alone with it. I sit with them as they have it and then I try to help them get through it.

Lenny (00:31:47):
That's something else I wanted to chat about is the feeling heard lesson that you have for people. I'd love to just get your advice on just how to help people feel heard. It's like, oh yeah, I know that's important. I want people to feel heard. I will listen and it'll go great. But you have some very tactical advice on how to actually make people feel heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:05):
Yeah, there's sort of a few different levels of it. One way to make people feel heard is, let's assume you're talking to them because there's another way, there's an even more surface way is verbal. Sometimes what I do is I ask, if I'm in a group of people, and there's a question or a problem that we're trying to solve, instead of going around the room and hearing people's verbal opinions, which takes forever, I ask everyone at the same time to take five minutes to write down their solution. Then we all drop it in a doc and then I just read it. When I read it I say, "Thank you, Lenny." And that makes you know that I at least read it, so that's a little bit of feeling heard.

Matt Mochary (00:32:40):
Second, if I want to make you feel more heard, I ask you to say it verbally and then I repeat it back to you. "Lenny, I think what I heard you say is... Is that right?" And you're like, "Yes." Or you're like, "No, not quite a little bit different." Then if it's a little bit different, I repeat it again until you say, "Yes, that's it." Now you know that I understood you.

Matt Mochary (00:33:00):
Then there's a third way which is even deeper, which is especially if you're giving me feedback, you likely don't want to hurt my feelings. So what you're doing is you're giving me the feedback, but you're couching it, you're polishing it, you're rounding the edges, you're making it softer. It's not really what you're thinking, but it's what you're willing to say. If I want to make you really feel heard, I reflect back what I imagine are the thoughts in your head. If I think you're feeling anger, I sort of think to myself, well, what would anger feel like? I cause myself to feel that anger, then what are the thoughts that appear to me? I say something to you like, "Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're off and you're thinking, screw you, Matt. How dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me? Is that close?" And you're like, "No, Matt."

Matt Mochary (00:33:49):
People either say one of two things, they say, "Yeah, that is it." Or they say "No, that's stronger than what I was thinking, but directionally that's right." What that really means is, yeah, that's what I was thinking. Almost always their thoughts are bigger than their words, but they really feel heard when I share their thoughts. Now, that's not the end of the process. I mean you actually have to then do something. Once you made them feel heard, you have to say, okay, well either I accept or don't accept this feedback and if I accept, here's what I'm going to do about it. If I don't accept, I need to explain to you why. Here's what's going on. You shared with me what's going on in your world, now let me share with you what's going on in my world. Hopefully, you can see why this thing that's going on in my world doesn't allow me to accept what it is that you shared, and hopefully now that you see what's going on in my world, your feedback changes and that's it. That's the whole process.

Lenny (00:34:45):
I'm listening to this advice and I'm like, yes, I will do this next time I'm talking to someone. I imagine people don't and they forget, and it takes time to actually learn these things. Like the firing advice you just shared, how do you actually get good at this and practice these things is like I have to work with a coach who will continue to reinforce these things? Is it follow these steps next time? Have them written down? What advice do you have for folks that are like, I want to get better at this. I want to start doing this stuff.

Matt Mochary (00:35:09):
Well, these docs are all free to the public in the curriculum. You can post them here, you can post them on Twitter, you can post the whole curriculum on Twitter, frankly, other people have. It has a step-by-step. There's a doc in there that is a step-by-step script. All you do is you read it and you follow the script in letting someone go or in making someone feel heard. My posit is once you do it one time, you're like, oh my god, that worked so well. That's the only motivation you need. And you've got the script, so you can just keep doing it. I don't think you need a coach.

Matt Mochary (00:35:42):
In fact, I remember one time I asked an investor who their best up and coming CEO was. The investor gave me a name. I was like, "Great, can I please get introduced to him? I want coach him." I reached out, the guy responded immediately. He's like, "Matt, I've read your book. I love your book. I read it three years ago. I've been implementing all the elements in our company. It's fantastic." When someone says that they know my work, they've already implemented it and it's worked, 10 out of 10 times, that person wants me to coach them. Then I said, "Great, that's fantastic. I'd love to coach you." And the guy said to me, "No, thanks." I was shocked. I was like, "Why?" He said, "Well, because it's all working. I don't have any problems. I don't think I need to be coached by you." I couldn't have heard a better answer. That, to me, is the ultimate answer. And he is right. He doesn't need me, doesn't need anyone.

Lenny (00:36:39):
I was going to ask if that's the goal of all of this writing down and systemizing is just to make yourself unnecessary.

Matt Mochary (00:36:45):
Totally.

Lenny (00:36:48):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.

Lenny (00:37:22):
If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Lenny (00:38:05):
That actually reminds me of another question a reader asked on Twitter who happened to be the one on only Ryan Hoover. He asked, "How has your approach changed in your coaching since you started?"

Matt Mochary (00:38:16):
Ryan obviously started Product Hunt and then he sold the company to AngelList, so he was part of AngelList when I went there because I was coaching Naval. What we realized coaching Naval is that Naval did not want to be CEO and he just didn't know how to get out. So, I said there's a way and I can show you, and so I did and made Naval's life 10 times better. Frankly, made AngelList 10 times better because Naval wasn't enjoying being CEO, therefore he wasn't good at it. We ended up putting someone in who did a fine job, then put someone else in who's doing an insanely good job. Now, of course, AngelList is massively valuable.

Matt Mochary (00:38:53):
Ryan was there at the time, Ryan Hoover, great guy, I love Ryan. So, what has changed since then? I think what's changed is I don't think back then I had any of this fear and anger give bad advice. I think back then it was all very tactical. It was all very high up management type stuff, which is you need to have goals and at the company level, at the department level, at the individual level, you then need to track those goals. You need to track all the agreements that people make, all the actions they say they'll do. You have to put it all in Asana. Everyone has to be able to see each other's Asana board so they can see what each other is doing. I still do that, but now I've added on this piece of oh, you're in the moment and you're feeling fear? Okay, you still got to go forward. That's sort of the big change.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I noticed that's at the top of the curriculum. Do you find that's where a lot of the biggest transformations happen, that curriculum component?

Matt Mochary (00:39:49):
Absolutely. I cause people when they first start coaching, they have to read that first. There's sort of three seminal documents: on time, top goal, and fear and anger give bad advice. On time just says, hey, we're going to start our meetings on time and you're going to show up and if you don't show up on time, you're going to let me know first. That's just because I don't want to... And by the way, I showed up two minutes late for us. That's because I was on the Google Hangout for 10 minutes. I didn't realize, I thought you were-

Lenny (00:40:21):
I'm trying to fix that bug. Every time we send an invite, there's a Google meet button there. I think I cracked it finally. Yeah, that would've been a funny podcast where I'm just sitting here starting on time and for two minutes. Hello, we're just waiting.

Matt Mochary (00:40:33):
Exactly. Second one is top goal, which is this concept from McKeown, who wrote Essentialism, which is everyone is making requests of you, but if all you do is spend all day is responding to other people's requests, you never actually march towards your own priorities. You need to A, create priorities and then set aside some amount of time each day, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours that you just work on your own priority. If you do that, you'll make massive gains. And that's true. I mean, in five minutes I can change someone's life just by having them follow that practice. Then the third one is, if you're in anger, give that advice and that's what I have people read and say, "Does this resonate with you?" If it does, we can work together and if it doesn't, we shouldn't work together. So yeah, that's kind of like the crux document of whether or not people philosophically are going to resonate with what I have to share.

Lenny (00:41:25):
The top goal piece, I'm reading a book called Make Time right now and that's a big part of it. I actually just added top goal to my calendar every day. It's not working yet. Every time I get to it, I'm like no, I'm going to just check Twitter right now. But I'm working on it.

Matt Mochary (00:41:38):
That is the hardest part. Now, what I've done is I'm similar. During my top goal time, I have somebody sit with me and they prevent me from doing anything but my top goal.

Lenny (00:41:51):
Wait, can you talk a bit more about that? Is this like a coworker? Are you just like, "I need you here for this hour every day?"

Matt Mochary (00:41:56):
Yeah, I mean it's like the same idea as a trainer in a gym. A trainer in a gym, maybe they're teaching you a little bit, but more often than not they're just forcing you to do the thing that you know need to do. But if they weren't there, you would kind of go eh and not do it. That's all this is. It's what I call an accountability partner.

Matt Mochary (00:42:15):
There's even an app now where you can go online and you can sign up and I think it costs like $5 a month and you can sign up to meet someone else and you become accountability partners to each other. It's insanely effective. I'm not the only one that has a problem focusing on tasks that I don't love that are necessary, but I don't love. Like a meeting, I could take a meeting, I could take 20 meetings, I could take 10 hours of meetings, no problem. Especially when I'm the presenter, when I'm the active one. But doing asynchronous tasks for me because so people-oriented that when there isn't another human with me, it's painful, so I just have another human with me.

Lenny (00:43:04):
I love that. And that person is doing other work, I imagine they're not just watching you full-time.

Matt Mochary (00:43:09):
No, they can do whatever they want.

Lenny (00:43:12):
Is this what you recommend to leaders and CEOs? Just have someone there for an hour. Wow.

Matt Mochary (00:43:18):
If your personality is like mine, yes, have someone there. It can be remote, it can be in person, it doesn't matter. In person's a little bit more effective.

Lenny (00:43:27):
Right, there's like a little zoom window.

Matt Mochary (00:43:28):
I have my kids do it. They love it.

# How to tell better stories | Matthew Dicks (Storyworthy)

## Transcript

Matthew Dicks (00:00:00):
Everyone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers. Because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind, that risks them getting picked off, right? Getting picked off by some predator. But the alternative is you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. I mean, how many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway, you really can't remember anything that they said? Because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart or facts or statistics or platitudes or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%. You will be forgotten.

Lenny (00:00:54):
Today my guest is Matthew Dicks. Matthew is the author of my All-Time favorite book on storytelling Storyworthy, which a previous guest of the podcast recommended to me and I couldn't put it down. So I reached out to Matthew and got him on the podcast. Matthew is a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner, and nine-time Grand Slam champ. He's also the author of nine other books, including fictions, rock operas, even a comic book.

(00:01:20):
In his day job, he is an elementary school teacher and on the side teaches both individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce. The skill of storytelling and public speaking through his company speak up. In our conversation, we get very tactical about how to tell better stories both in life and in work, how to feel more comfortable speaking on stage, how to come up with story ideas that you can deploy when the need arises. Why every good story is centered around one five-second moment of transformation and so much more. Matt is an incredible human being and I am excited to spread his message more widely. If you're interested in this topic, definitely pick up his book, Storyworthy. It'll change your life. With that, I bring you Matthew Dicks, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:04:28):
Matt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Matthew Dicks (00:04:31):
It's my pleasure. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:04:33):
I'm even more excited to have you on. The way I found out about you is a previous guest mentioned your book as a book that really transformed the way they think about storytelling and even marketing. And I completely agree. It's the most tactical, practical, also just entertaining book on just how to tell better stories. And when I was reading, I was just like, "Hey, what if I reach out to the author of this book and see if he'd come on?" And here we are.

Matthew Dicks (00:04:55):
I'm thrilled to be here, and I appreciate what you had to say. I tried to make my book as actionable as possible. I think the only reason I'm successful in what I do is that I've been a teacher for 25 years and I'm a storyteller. So the two of those things come together pretty well for me.

Lenny (00:05:12):
Okay, so I thought it'd be fun to start with maybe the most mind-expanding takeaway I got from this book, is this idea that all good stories are rooted in this five second moment of someone's life. Can you just talk about this insight and maybe share an example or two to make this real?

Matthew Dicks (00:05:28):
Sure. Well, that is true what you just said, which is essentially every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It can be one second honestly. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization. Which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing. And those changes they take place overtime. Or really what happens is it's an accumulation of events and feelings and thoughts that ultimately result in a singular moment where that flip actually happens. And I think that's true for almost everyone. It feels like it took a long time, but there really was one second when you thought one thing and then the next second when you thought the new thing.

(00:06:19):
And the purpose of a story is essentially to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible to the audience. So that the audience can, in a way experience that flip that transformation or realization along with the storyteller. So 98% of the story is the context to bring that singular moment into fruition. And that is true for stories that we tell out loud, stories we tell on the page, novels that I write, movies that I watch, television shows that I watch, all of the stories of the world that are worth hearing and truly just about every story told that qualifies as a story has one of those moments.

Lenny (00:06:58):
That's a big statement. Is there an example too, you could share of either stories we know or just tell a short story, whatever is easier to give people like, oh wow, you're totally right?

Matthew Dicks (00:07:06):
Sure. Well, I'll tell you one that happened actually today. How about that?

Lenny (00:07:09):
Amazing.

Matthew Dicks (00:07:10):
So I'm teaching math today. I'm an elementary school teacher and I'm teaching math, and I have a student in my class, her name is Eileen, and she's one of those kids that I worry about a little bit because she's got some anxiety. So she's not the most confident person in the world. And in September I was aware of this. So I've been working really hard at building confidence with her. And so today we're doing some math and I'm calling kids to the board, and I'm looking at Eileen and wondering, is today the day? Am I going to call Eileen to the board? Because doing so, there's a risk, there's inherent risk that she could be upset, she could embarrass herself in front of the class in a way that means something to her.

(00:07:52):
And I just wasn't sure. So I didn't call her to the board. And so at the end of the math lesson, I wandered over to her desk and I said, "So Eileen, I was thinking about calling you to the board today, but I just wasn't sure if you're there yet. What do you think?" And she said to me, "First of all, I don't like that cheeky smile of yours." And that is all I needed to hear. That was my five-second moment. That was the moment of realization where I understood that Eileen trusted me, felt confident enough in my classroom that she could be herself, that she could fire off a quip at a teacher, sort of take a shot at me. I knew at that point that now I can call her to the board, that she's going to be okay. So essentially it is a very brief story that I could actually expand into something much more meaningful.

(00:08:39):
I could make that into a five or six minute story about my journey with this student. Which would include, in the longer version of it, the steps that I took to discover who she was, the steps I took to help her reach the point she's at now. I would probably pull in some backstory about students who I was not so successful with. Some of my failures before I learned how to be a better teacher. And then I'd bring it to the moment where she says, first of all, I don't like that cheeky smile, and that's all I need to hear. So that is essentially a five-second moment for me. That is the same though as any other five-second moment. If you think about a movie like Star Wars, the first Star Wars that came out that is a movie essentially about religion, which people don't always see, but it is true.

(00:09:23):
There's a boy on a planet and he wants to go to space someday and fly a spaceship and use blasters to defeat the Empire. And along the way, he meets a religious figure to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he introduces him to a religion called The Force. And when the final moment comes for Luke Skywalker to defeat the Empire, his vision of using technology, a spaceship and a blaster to destroy the Empire, all of that goes away, and he turns off his technology in his spaceship. Instead, he uses The Force to guide his weapon to defeat the enemy.

(00:09:56):
And that is a story about a boy who once had no religion, and then some stuff happened and he had religion in the end. And that's why a story like that resonates with us in a way that another story might not, because we all understand what it's like to not believe in something and then find belief in something. Whether that is religious belief or I used to think cheeseburgers didn't taste good, and now I believe that they taste good. Either way, we understand that process and we can connect with Luke Skywalker in a meaningful way. So every story essentially has those moments, including, "I don't like that cheeky smile."

Lenny (00:10:29):
With this moment, what's also interesting is you talk about how knowing that moment of change also tells you how the story will end. So as a storyteller, you'll know how it ends based on knowing what this moment is, which then also tells you how it's going to start roughly. Can you just talk about that realization? Because, to me, every time I watch a movie now I'm like, wow, I know exactly how it's going to turn out just from the beginning.

Matthew Dicks (00:10:53):
So we start as storytellers at the end. Well, we start at the end if we are telling true stories about ourselves or our companies or our products, things that we know. I'm also a fiction writer. So when I start my novels, that's much more self-discovery. I really don't know the end of it. But in the storytelling that we're talking about, you have to know the end because you've lived the moment, and the end forms everything. So you know what you're going to say. You found a moment worth speaking to, that five-second moment. And then whatever that moment is, in my case, I discover that Eileen has more confidence than I realized and is ready to take a big step forward. What's the opposite of me realizing Eileen has confidence and is ready to step forward? It is, Eileen does not have confidence, and I need to help her find that confidence.

(00:11:39):
So that's the opposites that will work in a story. Essentially, a story is about these two moments in time, a beginning and an end, and they're operating in opposition to each other. Sometimes more so than others, sometimes exactly an opposition. But you're right. If you watch a movie and you'll pay attention to the first 10 to 15 minutes of a movie, you will ultimately know how that movie's going to end. You'll see a character, you'll discover what that character needs or their flaw or their desire, and you know that that's going to be at the end. The easiest one is a romantic comedy. Two people are not in love at the beginning of the movie. You know they're going to be in love at the end of the movie. Even knowing it doesn't mean the story's ruined. We can get there in a very entertaining way. When Harry Met Sally, that movie, when it begins, Harry and Sally actually say they hate each other at the very beginning of the movie, "I Hate You, Harry," right?

(00:12:32):
I hate that man so much. We know they're going to end up together, and the journey is well worth the fact that we know what's going to happen at the end. So it ruins a little bit of storytelling for people who think like me and go, "Oh, well, I know where this is going." But you have to do it in an entertaining way filled with all the other things we talk about in storytelling. But yeah, every story should be essentially a beginning and an end and opposition to each other, and you should start at the end, that guarantees that you have something important to say rather than what most people do, which is they simply report on their lives. They just tell you stuff that happened over the course of time in some chronological way that ultimately doesn't lead to anything. You want to always be saying something of import. So we start at the end with that moment of import.

Lenny (00:13:21):
It's funny, as I was thinking of when Harry met Sally exactly as you were talking as an example, my wife wants to watch that movie basically every night. It's like the one movie she could just watch a billion times.

Matthew Dicks (00:13:31):
Well, that's the power of story. I tell people this all the time. Why are we telling stories? You've never asked to see a PowerPoint presentation a second time. You've never gone to bed and dreamt about a PowerPoint presentation. You've never heard someone give a keynote and thought, I hope I get to watch that keynote again tomorrow. But movies, you'll watch a movie a hundred times, because it's a story, and our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again. You have a small child, right? Eventually you're going to be reading to that child when your baby's old enough and you're going to discover kids want to read the same book 50 times. They're really no different than adults except kid books are so small, you can read them endlessly. A movie takes two hours, so you don't get to read it as often as you might want or watch it as often as you might want. But Harry Met Sally comes on and you're halfway through. You're probably in. Even though every scene you can probably do the dialogue. We're wired for story. That's why it's so important.

Lenny (00:14:28):
Why is something changing so important? Why is that so critical to a good story, someone having a change or transforming?

Matthew Dicks (00:14:35):
Well, I think that actual moment of transformation lends importance to the story and allows the audience to connect to it. If I report it on my day to you, my day teaching in a classroom, I am unlikely to connect with you unless you are also a teacher and you experienced things similar to me. My wife is a kindergarten teacher. I'm a fifth grade teacher. If both of us report on our day, oddly, we will not really connect very often. She is teaching them how to write the letter C, and I am teaching them how to use the standard algorithm in multiplication. They could not be further apart.

(00:15:11):
So reporting on the moments that you have experienced in the day is not a way to connect to people. But when we talk about change, change has a great universal appeal. So you might not be a teacher who's trying to teach someone to find confidence in their life, but you might be a person who once lacked confidence and then found confidence in the way Eileen did. Or you might be a parent or the boss of someone who is trying to bring confidence to your child or your employee, your salesperson, whatever it is. When we do change, when we're focused in on that change, we increase exponentially the universal appeal to the story and our ability to connect to an audience. Even though the content we're speaking about has nothing to do with them, the actual emotional appeal will cause people to connect to us.

Lenny (00:16:00):
Fascinating. So building on that same thread of change, you also have this kind of checklist for what makes a good story. What is a good story, and I think it's only a three point checklist. One is there's a change that happens. Can you talk about the other two? I think there's only other two.

Matthew Dicks (00:16:16):
Well, the dinner test is probably one that you're thinking of.

Lenny (00:16:19):
Yeah, that's right.

Matthew Dicks (00:16:20):
So the dinner test is the idea that when you're telling a story in a formal way, if you're performing on a stage or delivering a keynote or even delivering a pitch to entrepreneurs or a sales pitch, essentially the story that you're telling should be very closely related to the story you would tell someone if you were having dinner. So there should be no performance art included within your story or within your talk. So weird things that people do should not be done. Like opening a story with unattributed dialogue. So you're standing on stage and you open your story with, "Jim, it's time to come in for dinner." My wife said, that's just weird. We don't talk like that as regular people, so you should not speak like that ever. In the history of the world, you should never speak like that. But people do it all the time.

(00:17:12):
It's this weird appendage from childhood when bad writing teachers thought that this was a good idea, or you start with a sound, which is very popular in first grade. You teach kids to start with sound, mostly because teachers are not writers, so they don't understand what writing actually is. And so they open with stories, with things like, bang, the door opened. But if you and I were having dinner and you said, "Hey, how was your day, Matt?" And I said, "Well, let me tell you Lenny. Bang, the door opened." You would not have dinner with me again.

(00:17:41):
So you have to be thinking that this is a slightly elevated version of the dinner story. Meaning you're probably not going to be interrupted in the middle of your story. And you want to have a little more shape to it, and you want to avoid some of the verbal detritus that tends to fill our lives. You don't want to be saying, you know, and like I said, all of that nonsense should get pushed to the side, but essentially people should feel like you're kind of speaking in a very natural way. So the dinner test is pretty important in that regard.

Lenny (00:18:09):
Awesome. Yeah, so the lesson there is when you're telling a story, make it sure that it's something that you could potentially tell at a dinner party. Slightly elevated is the way you put it.

Matthew Dicks (00:18:18):
Slightly elevated. Exactly.

Lenny (00:18:19):
I think the third point you make is that it has to be your story. You can't be telling a story on behalf of someone else. Maybe chat about that briefly?

Matthew Dicks (00:18:25):
So if you're telling a story about someone else, essentially, you might as well be telling fiction. Because that person's not in the room, and to the audience, they don't really exist. If they can't see them, that person is just another human being who supposedly lives somewhere in the world or once lived in the world. And because of that, you are almost unable to express any vulnerability in your story. You can't reveal anything about yourself. And one of the key parts of storytelling is to be vulnerable with your audience. Meaning I'm going to say stuff in a meaningful way. I might say stuff that most people are unwilling to share in a public way, but I'm at least going to offer up a little bit of my heart and mind. If I offer up the heart and mind of someone else that doesn't really require any vulnerability.

(00:19:09):
The only vulnerability is I have to stand in front of people and talk, which I know is challenging for some people, but that doesn't mean anything to the audience. We don't care if you're having a hard time presenting, if it's making you nervous. That doesn't mean much to an audience. What we really want is someone to open up their hearts and minds. So stories have to be about you in some way. There's tricks where you can tell stories about other people by taking that story and centering on yourself.

(00:19:36):
One of the examples, I work with the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and in the past, what they would do is they would just tell the story of the Holocaust survivor who has often at this point passed away, and it really does feel like fiction. A long time ago in a place that wasn't this a terrible thing happened. And there's a certain level of empathy and sympathy that you might feel. But what I teach them to do is to tell stories about themselves. And then at some point in the story about themselves, they're going to talk about how the experience of their parent or grandparent during the Holocaust has informed or changed their own life too. So they get to dip into some history, but that history is relevant to the storyteller. So it's no longer history. It's now something changed in me because something terrible happened to my parent or grandparent.

Lenny (00:20:24):
Just as a tangent, you also have this funny, useful checklist for how to tell vacation stories?

Matthew Dicks (00:20:30):
Well, first try not to, right?

Lenny (00:20:32):
I think that's step one. Do not tell vacation stories.

Matthew Dicks (00:20:34):
Most vacation stories are just simply a recounting of your vacation at the expense of another person. So unless something happened on that vacation where you experienced one of these five second fundamental moments of change, nobody cares about your vacation. And if something did happen, only be talking about the moment when it happened. So if I had a moment of change that took place on a Thursday night at dinner, that story is now going to take place on the Thursday night at dinner, and it's irrelevant that I'm in Aruba.

(00:21:07):
The fact that I am on vacation is almost completely irrelevant to the story, other than I may want to offer my location. But I'm not going to talk about the beach the day before or the scuba diving or the plane. All of that goes away. We're telling moments in our lives, and it doesn't matter where they happen. If your location is paramount to your story because you want people to know you were in Aruba, then you have to understand, no one actually cares that you were in Aruba and you're just a terrible person for trying to dump that on someone and use up their time so you can relive your vacation and perhaps humble brag about how much fun you had.

Lenny (00:21:46):
This will be a good segment for people to send their friends if they want to tell them their vacation stories. And here's a tip for how to do this better.

Matthew Dicks (00:21:51):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:52):
And just understand why it needs to be on a Thursday in that dinner, is the advice there? Keep it very focused and small, unless there's some really essential reason to share the context around the dinner.

Matthew Dicks (00:22:03):
Yeah, exactly. The shortest version of every story is the best version of every story. Starting as close to the end of a story is always the best place to begin. So if I had a moment of realization during dessert in a restaurant in Aruba, I may never tell them I'm in Aruba. I might start my story with, the dessert hits the table, and my wife says something that causes me to begin thinking, and that would be the beginning of the story. The fact that I'm on an island in the Caribbean may never come up in the entire story because it doesn't turn out to be relevant to the story.

Lenny (00:22:39):
There's a lesson that another guest shared, West Cow about... She calls it, When The Bear Starts Eating Your Tent, or something like that. Jump to when the bear is eating your tent. Don't do this whole introduction to why or how you got to this tent. It's just like the bear is eating our tent. That's where the story should start.

Matthew Dicks (00:22:54):
Yes, Kurt Vonnegut said that. Kurt Vonnegut said, "Start as close to the end as possible." He was talking about short stories written on the page, but it is a true notion in oral storytelling too. And it is, of all the things I help people with their stories, the most frequent suggestion that I make for revision is you've started your story in the wrong place.

Lenny (00:23:16):
I want to shift to business context advice. But before we do that, there's another really important element of storytelling, which is having stakes and having important stakes. So could you just talk about what is a stake and why is it important to have stakes? And then just what are examples of adding stakes to your story to make them more encouraging?

Matthew Dicks (00:23:32):
Sure. So stakes are essentially what your audience should be worried about, what they should be wanting for you, what they should be concerned about, what they should be wondering about. If your audience isn't wondering what you're about to say, they're no longer listening to you. And you have to internalize that in a deep and fundamental way. When I work with people in business, they are constantly under this misconception that people want to hear what they have to say. Some vice president of marketing thinks that because they're a vice president of marketing and everyone is sitting in a chair and looking at them, that they automatically have that audience's attention. I assume all the time, 100% of the time, that no one wants to hear anything I have to say. And so I am relentless in my attempt to get the audience to be constantly wondering what the next sentence is.

(00:24:17):
And stakes are a big part of that. Stakes are, I wonder what's going to happen next. I'm worried about this guy. Will he get what he wants? Will he get his comeuppance? Because he seems like a kind of a jerk in this story. All of those things are stakes. What is at stake for the storyteller, the company, the product, whatever it is, and therefore what the audience is worried about as well.

(00:24:39):
It's why Star Wars opens with a big spaceship shooting at a small spaceship. We don't even know who's on it yet, but we're already on the small spaceship side. We're already worried that a small spaceship is being shot at by a big spaceship, right? That's why stories start this way. Alfred Hitchcock has a movie where it opens with a police officer is chasing a man across a roof. We don't know who to root for, but something is at stake here. And now we're wondering what's going to happen next. We have to do the same thing with our ordinary true life everyday stories. We have to put stakes into stories.

Lenny (00:25:12):
There's something that you teach around surprise and the power of surprise as a part of stakes. I forget exactly what that is, but does that ring a bell?

Matthew Dicks (00:25:19):
Well, I'll separate them really. So with stakes, there's lots of ways to insert stakes. I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story, which is actually a big spaceship shooting at a little spaceship or a police officer chasing a guy across a roof. We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something. In my little Eileen story that I told you, I said, I'm teaching math and I've got this student and I'm worried about her, because I want to call her to the board, but I know she might lack some confidence. Right away, I have to make it clear what kind of story we're at. In a movie, you get a trailer. You don't often go to a movie and not have any awareness about what's about to happen. But when you open your mouth to begin telling a story, nobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that...

Matthew Dicks (00:26:00):
Nobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that causes an audience to go, "Oh, okay, well what's going to happen here?" So that's an elephant. That's like plant some big thing in the beginning of a story. It doesn't actually have to be what the story's about either. Sometimes it takes a little time to get to what the story's about, but you plant something there to at least get the audience to be worried, and then you can use some other tricks. I call something called a backpack, which is, you tell the audience what your plan is before you carry out your plan so that they sort of have your hopes and dreams packed up with them as well. If you watch an Ocean's 11 movie, you know what the plan is before they go into the casino. So as the plan goes awry, you can go, "Oh no," because you know what the plan is.

(00:26:42):
If you didn't know what the plan was, you would not be able to go, "Oh no." So that's loading your audience with your hopes and dreams so that they can feel those stakes. They can actually be hoping for you as well. There's things like breadcrumbs where you offer a little bit of what's going on, but not the complete idea, sort of drop a hint. The classic one is sort of the gun. There's a gun in the room, and there's a gun in the room, and it seems like it's not going to be relevant, but if you have a gun in the room, it's going to eventually go off. There's something going on there. That's like a bread crumb. Eventually we're going to get to that gun. Don't worry, it's going to happen. There's hourglasses, which is when you get to the moment where everyone is about to discover what's going to happen. That's the moment to slow time down.

(00:27:28):
You load your story with details because suddenly you know have the audience on the edge of their seat, and you want to leave them on the edge of their seat as long as possible. When I know my audience wants to hear the next sentence, that is when I prolong the arrival of the next sentence by I say turning over an hourglass and letting the sand run for a while, and making them wait for it. There's crystal balls where you can predict a future. You don't have to predict an accurate future. You can just predict any future. So I could have said something in the Eileen story like, "If I get this wrong, Eileen is going to begin to cry. She's going to cry in front of 22 kids, 22 kids who for the rest of the year will continue to stare at this girl, and remember the moment she cried." That's a crystal ball.

(00:28:10):
That's me predicting a terrible future. Because I put that terrible future in the audience's mind, now they're worried. So that is a stake. I have planted a false stake, a false future, but they're going to be worried about it because it's also a realistic future. So all of those things are used to continue to get the audience to wonder what's going to happen next, which is a little different than surprise. Surprise is just that beautiful, delightful, amazing moment where the audience didn't see something coming, and then it was almost like it was inevitable. Surprise happens, and they understand why it happened. I think it's the best thing you can ever offer an audience, is a moment of surprise. And every story has a surprise, at least one. Because whenever we suddenly realize something for the first time, I hate the word suddenly, but what happens is we used to not think something, and then we think a new thing, and that's often a surprise for us if we make it a surprise for the audience too, that's a delightful thing. So surprise is so powerful, and wonderful, and always ruined by storytellers.

Lenny (00:29:11):
I was just listening to an interview with, I think his name is David Mamet, and he made this point that endings of books and movies always has to be both inevitable, and also complete surprise.

Matthew Dicks (00:29:21):
Yes, both of those things. So inevitable means there has to be enough information placed earlier in the story so that when the surprise happens, the audience goes, "Yes." But also you have to be clever enough to plant that information in such a way that the audience doesn't see the surprise coming. You build information into the audience's mind that will allow the surprise to land in an inevitable and yet surprising way. That is the best surprise you can offer someone.

Lenny (00:29:51):
Easier said than done.

Matthew Dicks (00:29:52):
Yes, well, there's lots of tricks to do that as well, but it takes some time. But essentially what you end up doing is, you're hiding the information that they need to know in a multitude of ways so that when it lands, they go, "Oh my gosh, ABCD." They don't connect it until the surprise hits, and then they go, "Of course, ABCD." So you place ABCD in a story, but you don't place it in such a way that they can connect the dots until you want them to connect the dots.

Lenny (00:30:20):
I feel that's a whole other hour of podcast conversation to figure that out.

Matthew Dicks (00:30:23):
That's like ninja level next level storytelling, which is very teachable. Everything I say is very, very teachable and doable by anybody, but yes, it's a trickier thing to accomplish.

Lenny (00:30:35):
Okay, that'll be for a second podcast episode. Just to summarize, you shared I think five ways add stakes. Just to summarize; one is crystal ball. You basically predict the bad thing that'll happen if you don't do this thing. Hourglass, which is when something is about to happen slow time down. I think of Pulp Fiction and Tarantino in this often of just like, you know some violence is about to happen, and they go next door, and like, "Let's just eat a cheeseburger," instead for a while. And then this backpack idea of they know exactly what you're trying to do, and it's on you and the entire movie. Breadcrumbs where you give them a little bit of information along the way. I think maybe that's it. Maybe there's one more.

Matthew Dicks (00:31:12):
And then the elephant at the beginning.

Lenny (00:31:14):
Oh, the elephant, just like the big ol', here's the steak. I wish-

Matthew Dicks (00:31:16):
You got to have something.

Lenny (00:31:18):
I heard some advice in either your book, a different book about adding stakes is just drop a dead body. Every new dead body is additional stakes that are added to the story. I don't know how often people can do that in random stories.

Matthew Dicks (00:31:30):
But what you can take from that is, so often people load the front end of a story with all of the stakes because they're worried that the audience will not pay attention to them. So they think I'm going to throw everything right in front, and that'll hold an audience for the rest of the story, and that's a mistake. What we want is stakes continually to build throughout a story. So dropping a dead body really means, drop a new steak, don't load it all, don't front load it, give us something to wonder about, and then gauge when we need the next thing to wonder about, and spread out those stakes. We need most of the stakes to occur within the first half of a story. Ideally, the second half of the story is now the rollercoaster to the end. So we might drop one in there at an appropriate time, or just through plot. Sometimes they just happen to need to be in a place. But so often I hear people front load stakes because they're worried about audience attention.

Lenny (00:32:21):
Just to give people something concrete to think about when they're thinking about this area. Is there a story of yours that's online that we can point people to see an example of really good stakes in action?

Matthew Dicks (00:32:31):
So the one that I reference in my book, which you can go watch online is, Charity Thief. It needs a lot of stakes because two thirds of the story nothing really happens. Two thirds of the story is explaining how I end up on a porch. So that's not super entertaining unless I build in lots of stakes along the way. I'm not inventing anything, I'm just presenting the actual events in a way that makes you wonder what's going to happen next. So there's an elephant at the beginning of that story, which is actually not what the story's about because I say the elephant can change colors along the way, but I give you something to wonder about along the way. I know I use a backpack, and I use a breadcrumb, and an hourglass, and a crystal ball. I do it all in that story mostly because it's not super entertaining.

(00:33:19):
Some stories you don't have to worry so much about. I perform as a stripper in the break room of a McDonald's restaurant when I'm 19 years old for a bachelorette party. There are stakes in that story, but I don't need to put any of them in because everybody wants to know what's going to happen already. Sometimes you just have a story that the stakes are already pre-built because the ridiculousness of the moment. But most of our stories are not like that. Most of them are far more benign, and we have to jack up the stakes by using some tricks to get people to the point we want them to be in.

Lenny (00:33:50):
That stripper story I've also watched, and I'll point to it, and I love, it's connected to another piece of advice you always shared. People just say yes to stuff, at the power of yes. I don't want to get into it yet, I want to come back to that.

Matthew Dicks (00:34:00):
True.

Lenny (00:34:00):
We'll leave that breadcrumb but I love that point. Okay, so let's transition to helping people in business learn all these skills, and translate them to becoming better in their work. And maybe actually to add some stakes, what benefits do people get/what problems do they run into if they aren't great at storytelling versus if they learn the skill, and can implement it at work? What happens, what good things come out of that?

Matthew Dicks (00:34:25):
Well, if you don't tell stories as part of your business, whether you're looking for investment, or speaking to your people, or speaking to customers, or clients, anything, if you're not telling stories, the good news is, you're just like everybody else. The bad news is, you're mediocre just like everybody else. You're in a lane that everyone else is in, which means that you're going to be forgettable. I often say most communication in business is round white and flavorless intentionally so because a lot of people are afraid to stand out. When I try to get people to tell stories, everyone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind that risks them getting picked off, getting picked off by some predator.

(00:35:18):
But the alternative is, you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. How many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway you really can't remember anything that they said? My wife and I actually attended an educational conference recently. She's a teacher, I'm a teacher. There was a bunch of speakers. The first person came out with his childhood lunchbox, put it on a table, and told a story about how his parents had nothing while he was growing up. And yet they somehow kept him in new shoes, and a new backpack every year, and sent him to school with a lunch every day, and how much it meant to him, and how as an educator today he thinks about every single kid in his class like he was, a kid who had nothing except for all of his parents' hopes and dreams.

(00:36:04):
I'll never forget that story. It was a story. It was a story of vulnerability, and humor and meaning. There was another person who spoke, a sort of executive we'll say, and he did a great job in terms of being fluent, and presenting ideas, and speaking well, and speaking confidently. And 15 minutes after the conference I said to my wife who is a teacher and understands storytelling because we do it together.

(00:36:27):
I said, "What'd you think?" She said, "Well, I'm never going to forget that guy with the lunchbox." I said, "I will not either." I said, "What'd you think about the other guy?" And she goes, "He was great." I said, "So what did he say?" Five teen minutes after, and she went, "I actually can't tell you a single thing he said." This is a woman who's a teacher, and invested in storytelling and communication. Her impression was, he was fluent, he was amusing, he said some numbers, he said some things that seemed to mean something. But it was all forgotten because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart, or facts, or statistics, or platitudes, or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten, 100% you will be forgotten.

Lenny (00:37:18):
When people hear this, they may think, "Oh man, there's this guy at work, and he's always telling stories." And we're like, "Shut up." Just tell me what we need to do to make it a little more real of just what does storytelling look like where it's not annoying. It's not like, "Okay, everyone, gather around. Let me tell you the story of our vision." What are some simpler ways, and maybe non-annoying ways to think about what storytelling looks like in the workplace that's not just like a public speaking like, "Hey, everyone, I'm going to give you."

Matthew Dicks (00:37:43):
Let me give a couple of examples. I have a storytelling book coming out next year on business. So there's a couple of heroes in that story. One of them is named Boris. His name's Boris Levin, he is a factory owner here in Connecticut. He's the one who convinced me I could start working with businesses. I thought it was just a storyteller who spoke about himself on a stage. Boris one day saw me for some fundraiser and said, "Listen, I want you to come and help me." I said, "I can't do that. I just tell. I'm using stories about myself." He said, "No, no, you can help me." And it turns out he was totally right. So Boris has done it the right way. Boris has decided to become a storyteller who will then translate his stories into his business.

(00:38:19):
So a great example was, one of Boris's early stories, he came to me, and he said, "My son was at bat in the Little League Championship game. The bases were loaded, if my son got a hit, the team was going to win the championship. And if my son struck out, the team would lose the championship." It's a three and two count. It is like the ultimate baseball moment, and his son strikes out. He watches his son drag that bat back to the dugout. He's devastated. His son's devastated and Boris is devastated. So he is trying to collect himself so he can figure out the right thing to say to a boy who's just lost the championship for his team. By the time he makes it onto the other side of the field to catch up with his son, he sees his son running up a hill with his friends, and they're already laughing.

(00:39:09):
They're heading to the cars so they can go to ice cream, and they can enjoy themselves. So Boris is falling apart. He's still devastated, but his son has already moved past the failure. Boris takes that story, and he crafts it as a beautiful story that he could tell on a stage, and perform and make, an audience laugh and cry. Once the story's done, he says to me, "So what are we going to do with it? How are we going to apply this to business?" And ultimately what happens is this, he's got a sales team. And quite often salespeople do not land the big account they're hoping to land, and Boris knows that when his salespeople fail to achieve what they want to achieve, they will often sulk for days. They'll wander around the office, and be useless because they're still trying to get past the fact that they just lost the million dollar contract.

(00:39:56):
So he tells the story about his son, and he says, "Listen, there's nothing wrong with being sad, being upset with failure, but we cannot allow it to slow us down as much as we are right now. We have to think about my son. My son dragged his bat back to the dugout. He sat down, he sighed, his buddies patted him on the back, he collected himself, and he moved on. That's what we need to do. When we fail we're going to take a moment to collect ourselves, to think about the mistakes we made, to decide what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to move on." That becomes a really important moment in his company.

(00:40:32):
It's much better than him standing up in front of his people and saying, "Listen, every time you guys fail to land a big sale, you wander around this office like you're dead, and you're wasting our time. It ends today. Today from now on when you fail, you're going to move on." The story becomes something meaningful to everyone because it reveals something about Boris. He's a father, he's a father who cares about his son. He's the kind of father that most of us are in life. He shares of himself with his people, and he creates a tangible vision of what the sales team can do. He does that all the time. He comes to me, and he's not looking to solve problems through story. He's looking to develop stories that he can then deploy into his business. So I compare it, I say, band-aids versus bricks. If you're building bricks, you're a storyteller that's capturing stories and building bricks, then you can eventually deploy into business. If you're a band-aid person, which is fine, that happens. "I have a problem, Matt, and I need a story to solve it."

(00:41:34):
Essentially what I'm doing there is I'm putting a band-aid over a problem, but you're not becoming a better storyteller. You're just using me as a consultant to help you generate a story that will solve a problem. That's fine, but you're going to need me the next time too. You're going to keep needing me because you're not really becoming a storyteller. Boris is building bricks. He is building a vault of stories that he can then deploy into his business. He understands how to tell them, and how to connect them to business. So that's something that you can do very easily.

(00:42:02):
Another example, the other star of my book is a woman named Marsha Rakofsky. She used to be the director of corporate communications at Slack, and now she's sort of doing work on her own. But when she was with Slack, she and I were working closely together, and she had to create the narrative that was going to compete against Microsoft Teams. Essentially, Microsoft came along and said, "Hey, we copied your product and it's free, and everybody already has it."

(00:42:25):
So Slack had to find a way to combat that, and Marsha was the one in charge of doing it. That's why we connected. She found me and said, "I need to tell a good story. Please help me tell a good story." So she crafted a brilliant narrative that worked fantastically. We worked really closely together, and it came out great. The way she came up with that narrative was a Tuesday night. She had broken up with her boyfriend, she was alone. She was feeling pretty lonely. It was in the midst of the pandemic. She had two glasses of wine in her, sitting alone on a Tuesday night, she suddenly had an inspiration. She wrote three words down on a napkin, and those three words become the story that we develop that allows Slack to compete against Microsoft.

(00:43:04):
When it comes time to her present that narrative, I say, "You're going to include the Tuesday night and the two glasses of wine, and all that, right?" And she's like, "No, I'm not. That's not what we do in the corporate world. We do not insert ourselves into our narratives." And to her credit, she didn't put it in, and it still worked brilliantly. She was fine. But about a month later, she was presenting that same narrative to a smaller group, lower stakes. I said, "Let's just put it in, just try it this time." And to her everlasting credit, she did. She put in a 30-second anecdote about Tuesday night, two glasses of wine, feeling lonely in the middle of a pandemic.

(00:43:42):
She said to me later, "I can't believe the difference that that 30 second anecdote meant to the narrative. Because suddenly when I reached the end of the narrative, people wanted to talk to me. People came up to me, and the first thing they said was," "Oh God, I remember I was feeling the same way during the pandemic."

(00:43:59):
People connected to her because instead of being a corporate monolith, sort of like Slack spokesperson without personality, which is what we tend to be in business, she was an actual human being who had an inspiration on the Tuesday night, and then was bringing it forth in a meaningful way to an audience. And from that point on, she always has been doing those things in storytelling. She's always looking for a way in her narratives to insert herself, or if she's working with a client, let's find a way that we can work the client into the story as well. Because people don't want to hear spokespeople present information. They want to hear human beings connect with you, and then offer you something that perhaps will have value.

Lenny (00:44:41):
That is a really interesting lesson. So is your advice just when you're telling stories in business, try to find a way to make it personal about you as the person telling the story?

Matthew Dicks (00:44:50):
Yeah. I have this tool I use with corporate folks called, a personal interest inventory. It is a list of all the things that you should be saying about yourself in clever and strategic ways that I teach. Each one of them has an addressable market. So how many people could this potentially hit? And then the intensity of the connection. So for example, if you're married, you should always make it clear to people you're married, especially if you're a man. Because if you're a man, and you're married, you're safer in the world because men are inherently just dangerous human beings. We just are. If you hear that there was a shooting, you never think, "Oh, I wonder if that was a twenty-three- year-old blonde woman." You know who did the shooting almost all the time. So if you're married, what you're essentially saying to people is, someone has agreed to spend theoretically their life with me.

# Good Strategy, Bad Strategy | Richard Rumelt

## Transcript

Richard Rumelt (00:00:00):
Don't call it strategy, call it an action agenda. It's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on mission and your vision and your values, all these things that have to be in place before you can have strategy. That's not true. Begin to try to identify the one or two key challenges that can actually be addressed and what are we going to do about it? What are the coherent actions we're going to do to take these on? Okay, we're going to go after this and here's the action steps we're going to take to do that. That's the essence of what you're doing when you're thinking strategically.

Lenny (00:00:42):
Today my guest is Richard Rumelt. Richard is an absolute legend in the world of strategy. It was such an honor to have him come on the podcast. He's the author of Good Strategy Bad Strategy, which I've gifted to countless people who wanted to become more strategic. He's been mentioned so many times on this podcast. He's also the author of The Crux, his most recent book, which some consider his best book, which delves even further into his advice on how to craft a winning strategy.

(00:01:08):
Richard was a longtime professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, was on the faculty of Harvard Business School, and he's consulted on strategy with companies like Microsoft, Apple and Intel, and also with government organizations like the US Army Special Ops Command, and folks like Donald Rumsfeld. In our conversation, Richard shares the concrete elements that make a good strategy, why we'd be better off calling them action agendas rather than strategies, why every great strategy starts with a clear diagnosis of the biggest challenge that you face. Also, how to actually lay out a strategy, why organizational dynamics are often the biggest hindrance to winning strategies and so much more. I could keep going, but let me just say we cover a lot of ground in this episode and Richard shares incredibly thoughtful and deep answers to each question. I'm excited to bring you Richard Rumelt, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:58):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you'll probably find those little in-product pop-up really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature. And these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible. But every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of every one.

(00:02:24):
CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at CommandBar.com/Lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's CommandBar.com/Lenny.

Richard, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Richard Rumelt (00:04:33):
Thank you for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:35):
It is such an honor to have you on this podcast. So many guests on the podcast have mentioned you and mentioned the book. I probably bought your book for, I don't know, dozens of people over the years, and it is just so cool to have you on and to get to delve into the stuff that you teach. So thank you again for being here.

Richard Rumelt (00:04:51):
Thank you.

Lenny (00:04:51):
I thought we'd start at the beginning and then work our way up and kind of see where the conversation goes. What is the simplest way to understand a strategy? What is a strategy, and then what are the essential components of a good strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:05:05):
Well, a strategy is a design for overcoming a high-stakes challenge. It's a mixture of policy and action designed to deal with a challenge. The challenge could have an upside. It could be, "Oh geez, we were fooling around in the back 40 and we discovered oil, what we do?" Or it could be negative, could be that new innovation is driving us out of the market. But a challenge is the hardest strategy. The work comes from Strategos, which is Greek. The Greeks elected 10 Strategoi to serve as strategic leaders at Athens. And they were elected and they dealt with issues of the day, the Persians are invading, there's a plague in town, we need money for a new temple. And that's where the word comes to us from. It isn't just military, it wasn't in Athens. So strategy is always about dealing with an issue, a challenge, a problem. What are we going to do about global warring? What are we going to do about China wants to reunify with Taiwan?

Lenny (00:06:24):
You obviously have these very infamous famous elements of a good strategy, something you call the colonel. Can you just talk through those pieces?

Richard Rumelt (00:06:33):
Right, sure. So when I used to teach strategy for many years at Harvard and then at UCLA and other places, there's lots of ways of looking at strategy. And so years and years ago, we used to look at the [inaudible 00:06:51] and the matrix and the five forces and all of those kinds of analytical tools. And it began to dawn on me at some point that this is a strategy. These are analytical tools for analyzing the problem, for thinking about things, for looking at competition. But they're not strategy. Strategy is, one, and I started to write a book and the first chapter of the book was... the first part I wrote was the David and Goliath strategy story. And my point in writing about David and Goliath was that the surprise that David is able to beat this giant warrior, and that's a strategy story. Strategy story is about discovered strength.

(00:07:43):
It's about, oh wow, look at how they did that. Look at how he got made in five moves. That's a strategy story. Look at how Steve Jobs changed the world when people couldn't expect it. That's emotionally what a strategy story is. So I want to write about strategy. And my wife Kate asked me, "Well, do you define strategy?" I said, "Oh, it's really hard. I can't define it." And she said, "Well, you can't write a book about it if you can't define it." Because I said I had this other conceptual scheme in my head that all teachers and writers had, which is that there's a bunch of analytical tools. And this is back in 2005, 2004.

(00:08:31):
And I gradually came to the realization all strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges, and that was a basic idea going in the book. So if that's the core of it, what's the basic activity? What are you doing when you create a strategy? Well, you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with? Now, humans can't understand all of reality. No one can. So part of what a diagnosis is, is a decision about what you're going to pay attention to and the hypothesis for several hypotheses about what's going on, how do things connect together. And that's beginning of the diagnosis. And so diagnosis is an understanding of the situation that you're in. Well, that's not novel. And you can use any of those tools that are famous for that and you can try to find forces. You can do any one of a number of things to try to comprehend the situation. The world is more complicated than 2x2s, unfortunately. I was educated as an electrical engineer and my early years were spent designing spacecraft for NASA. And when I got into looking at business and business strategy stuff, I was always amazed at how unintellectual it was, that I was struggling to master Z-transforms and multiple, and yet these people are looking at 2x2s and little diagrams [inaudible 00:10:19], oh, that's what the company's about. So a rich diagnosis of the situation, but then a guiding policy.

(00:10:28):
The guiding policy is what are we going to do? Now, it's a simple thing to say, a guiding policy, and the guiding policy is sort of the strategy. It's the core of it. It's here's how we're dealing with the situation. And yet, when I say that, it flies in the face of, as I was writing that, I had a client who had 17 priorities. This is what we're doing. We have 17 priorities. And that's the opposite of policy. That's a laundry list of all the things we wish would happen over the next year. We're going to gain market share in China, we're going to cut our emissions, we're going to save energy, we're going to become safer, we're going to cut costs, all these different things that we're going to do. And they're all priorities. Now, lots of people need misuse the word priority when they're trying to do all that. You wouldn't want to be in a commercial airplane and hear the tower say to the pilot, "I'm giving priority to the following three planes on runway five." Right away, you know there's something wrong.

(00:11:50):
Well, that's the word priority, it means the first. It doesn't mean the grab back everything that you can think of that might matter. It means what's first. And so the guiding policy is sort at that level of what do we really have to do here and what are we doing and what are we not doing to deal with the diagnosis that we created?

(00:12:14):
And then the most important part of a strategy, the part that it's so easy to leave out because people like to think of strategy as this high level conceptual thing, is the coherent action. You have to do something. And what you do has to be coherent in several ways. The first way is it has to deal with the problem or the diagnosis and the guiding policy, it has to implement. It has to be coherent in that you shouldn't do things that fight each other.

(00:12:51):
You shouldn't say, "Oh, we are going to burn less oil and at the same time we're going to import more oil." It doesn't make any sense to do things that are self-contradictory. And yet, people do it. Most companies have strategic goals of increasing growth and increasing profit. Magically, that can happen in some cases. Growth and profit, they battle each other. Let's say we define profit as return on equity. If you're going to increase growth and increase return on equity, how do you do that? Because you're basically trying to invest less to get your return on equity up. Or you're going to grow and get your profit margin up. Well, how are you going to do that? You get your profit margin up and grow faster.

(00:13:52):
This is baby talk, but CEO after CEO will stand up and say, "Well, we're going to grow and we're going to make a profit." And so having coherent actions, actions that dump milk on one another is an important part of strategy. All three elements have to be there. There has to be an understanding of the situation. There has to be a guiding policy, how are we going to deal with it? And that could be a long-term sense of how we could change. You don't have to change your strategy every five minutes or every five years. If you're making Almond Joy candy bars or something, you don't really change your strategy constantly. If you're in the tech business, of course you have a shorter time horizon. And then the coherence and action is critical. And so these are the three, what I call basic elements, the kernel that if anyone in three is missing, something's wrong. It's not really a strategy, it's something else.

Lenny (00:15:04):
Awesome. Okay. Is there an example that you could give that makes these even more concrete of just, I don't know, something that comes to mind that's a quick example of a strategy that illustrates these three components?

Richard Rumelt (00:15:17):
If you're Microsoft right now and you're trying to adapt to AI, you have a diagnosis. Well, what's going on? You see the challenge of how do we adapt to it? You create a guiding policy that you're going to invest in one of the major leaders and that you're going to begin to incorporate that into your search engine. And then you have coherent actions. You actually do some of these things. It's not rocket science. The difficulty is that companies don't do that.

(00:15:55):
There are companies that say, "Well, our future is"... let's say something that's not in a software business. That's industry 4.0 for 5.0 that we're going to have... we're investing in the future of robotics and AI and even computer vision and all that. That's going to be our future. And then you see what they're doing. They've bought this company, they've bought this company, they've bought this company, and that's it. It's strategic assembly without any synthesis. So strategy's not mysterious. What's mysterious to me, what was mysterious to me and what remains mysterious to me is how so many organizational leaders don't do it. They create bad strategy. They do something that they say is strategy and then it's not.

Lenny (00:16:55):
You have a whole chapter on this, on what is a bad strategy. Can we just touch on a few of the things you see as signs that your strategy is bad or maybe it doesn't even exist?

Richard Rumelt (00:17:05):
Sure. When I wrote Good Strategy Bad Strategy, a lot of people resonated with the bad strategy. Part of the book, they wrote emails and saying, "Oh my God, thank goodness someone just finally said that these long and terminal meetings I sit through are not actually strategy." Or these documents that the company produces are not actually strategy. And they're not. Bad strategy, the standard bad strategy for a corporation is a set of profit goals or performance goals. A set of goals. Goals are the engineering of how companies work to some extent. But abstract, high-level goals, they're not strategy, they're something else. They're ambitions. And ambitions are not a strategy. A list of all the different things you wish would happen is not strategy.

(00:18:13):
I was asked to help part of the U.S. Department of Defense create a strategy for what's 17 different intelligence agencies.

Lenny (00:18:26):
Wow, how cool.

Richard Rumelt (00:18:29):
Yeah. There's 17 different intelligence agencies. And the strategy basically that these people had written said the 17 agencies should work together more effectively. Now, you don't have to be a Russian spy to see that what they're really saying is these guys aren't working together effectively and it's a problem. But they didn't say that. They said the strategy is they're going to work together more effectively. Just like the RV always comes out with our strategy is join us, meaning we're having trouble with coordinating.

(00:19:08):
But then there's nothing there about that other than this is what should happen, there should be more effective coordination. And oh, we'll have an office of coordination, put a person in charge of coordination. But there's no sensible... why is it hard to coordinate? What are the barriers to this? This has been going on for 34 years now. What's holding it back? What is a problem we have to solve? It's not there.

(00:19:37):
So I was hired to do a foundry for a company and they said, "Well, our diagnosis is not growing fast enough." Okay, let's get into that because that's not a diagnosis, that's a statement. It's a statement of value, you would like to grow faster than you are. I'd like to be taller than I am. I'd like to have more hair. You want to grow faster. Okay, so what's holding you back? And from [inaudible 00:20:19]. But saying, okay, we're going to grow, that's not a strategy.

(00:20:23):
Bad strategy also is fluff. People will use fancy words to describe their situation. Since I wrote that, the term word salad has become common. And there's a lot of word salad writing that people try to use to describe their situation. It sounds more abstract perhaps more abstract. Therefore, it's more strategic, incoherent stuff where we're going to do A, and we're going to B and those two things obviously fight one another. All those things are part of bad strategy. Bad strategy is a document or a set of intentions or a set of verbalizations where it's not a strategy. There's no diagnosis. Of course, I don't doubt that. Started out saying where United States is falling behind in education. And he's looking at the piece of the PISA test scores of 15 year olds around the world. And it's true, the United States is down, number of 30 countries in terms of the scores of our 15-year-old, in math and in general knowledge. Okay, correct statement, we're falling behind. A real diagnosis would say, because. We jumped immediately to therefore, we're going to have more people go to college than any other country. Well, having more people go to college doesn't solve the problem of 15 year olds not being able to do elementary math. Hopefully it doesn't screw up colleges everywhere. So that kind of gap, it's there, where you don't do the diagnosis. Why do we have this? We argue over diagnosis as part of politics and part of organizational politics. That's what we do, and that's important. To do a strategy, you have to resolve the argument. Why do we have a homeless explosion in Portland or Seattle or Los Angeles? And people argue about that. Some people say, "Oh, strokes." Some people say, "Oh no, housing is too expensive." There are different diagnosis. But to deal with the issue, you have to decide on the diagnosis. The politicians right now sort of decided for a few years that the problem is housing's too expensive, we're going to build housing at $700,000 a unit and give it to the all people. Okay. If you build it, they will come.

(00:23:28):
But then the next problem is, well, can't seem to build a housing. And so again, you need a new diagnosis. Why can't you build a housing? You're a rich, powerful country. Why can't you build some housing? So diagnosis is critical to understanding it. And in public policy, we argue over the diagnosis. And in organizations we argue. And unless you resolve it, you can't act. So lacking diagnosis is one of the key reasons for bad strategy. The other, the fluff and the incoherent actions are fun to describe, but they're less common. The second major source of bad strategy is mistaking goals for strategy, saying these goals are our strategy. And that leaves out so many of the important aspects.

Lenny (00:24:22):
Amazing. So just to summarize somewhat, if you're missing a diagnosis, trying to explain what exactly is wrong, it's a sign your strategy is incomplete or bad. If you're missing concrete actions, it's a sign that your strategy is incomplete or bad. There's also I think an element of coherence. The actions have to connect and there have to be a few, very few of them. I always like to think of three as a good number. Is that something you think about, the rule of thirds for actions you want to take or even the guiding policy, or is there a number that you think about just like no more than this?

Richard Rumelt (00:24:53):
A few. A few. Not too many. Not 17. It's hard. Numbers. We work best when we concentrate. We're more effective when we concentrate on a few things, a few people, a few... focus, it's the fundamental source of power and strategy. Trying to do too many different things is defocusing.

Lenny (00:25:18):
I think there's this quote in your book that I think is, and this may be paraphrasing, each time you say yes, you risk turning a nascent good strategy into a bad strategy.

Richard Rumelt (00:25:28):
Yes. Focus is... when I was nine years old, I was at summer camp and I had my parents sent me a magnifying glass and I was out there using the sun to try to cook a piece of wood. I think I had a piece of cloth that I was trying to burn, wasn't having much luck. The magnifying glass focuses the sun's rays on the spot. Counselor came over and he said, "Try this," and he pulled out a black thread from his T-shirt, put it down. And I focused the sun's rays hard, popped out. So stupid little story. But to burn that black thread, there has to be a source of power, the sun. There has to be a focus, that's the magnifying that to the power. And it has to be a target that can be affected. It has to be a black thread, not white thread. And that sequence is part of strategic action. You need a source of power. I say power, I don't say advantage or efficiency.

(00:26:53):
I say power because there are different ways in which power is exhibited and you have to focus the power on a target that can actually be affected or achieved. And this is real simple logic, but it's a discipline to focus power on a target that you can affect. Take American power and say we're going to change China's trajectory and Russia's trajectory and our own and to name all the 30 countries around the world that we're trying... we're diffusing our efforts because they're not the same. They're going in different directions. Obvious when you say it, not so obvious as you live it, because like any organization, like any big organization, US government has different interests. They're pursuing different interests funded for different purposes with different clientele. And so there's gradually a diffusion-

Richard Rumelt (00:28:00):
And so there's gradually a diffusion of effort. One of the big issues in strategy is simply the organization, complex organizations particularly. You have a hard time focusing energy because of all the different interests.

Lenny (00:28:21):
Yeah. Actually I want to talk about both those things, so I'm glad that you teed them up. Let's talk about power. What is this idea of power and how does that play into strategy? Why is it so important? And then what are some examples of power that people can think about when they're trying to think about implementing and adding a power to their strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:28:40):
Well, in a competitive situation, the fundamental aspect of power is something that's going to give you some sort of advantage. Usually it's in asymmetry of some kind. If two fighters are equally balanced or two horses are equally fetched or two armies are equally... And they meet in competition, it's 50/50. Who knows what will happen. For a strategy you need to exploit in asymmetry of some kind. You hear a little faster. Or they're a little... Something has to be different between now and between things. So that's the beginning of power, is asymmetry. We can think of it as leverage, but sometimes think first is a source of power.

(00:29:43):
Being first to recognize something can be a source of power. Having a reputation of a certain kind gives you some power that someone doesn't have that reputation doesn't have. On the other hand, having a well-established reputation of a certain type can be the opposite of power because people don't expect you to be able to do something new. They expect you to be able to do this, but not that. Having relationships can be a source of power. When Gerstner took over IBM as it was failing in the face of the microprocessor revolution, he recognized that their primary asset, their source of power, was that they were respected and they had [inaudible 00:30:38] into every large corporation on the planet. Nobody else had that as an actual producing company. And so he said, we're going to embrace our customers. Bear hug our customers. We're going to serve our customers.

(00:30:58):
That's our source of our power. That's our leverage. That's the synergy. Now the world begins to change and computing begins to move to the cloud. And IBM's customers, the largest companies in the world, are the most hesitant to do that, because they've got the big IT departments that don't want move to cloud. And so small companies move to the cloud and the big companies are, well, it's insecure in the cloud. We'd have to lay off people. We have these big machines we like to run.

(00:31:39):
And so IBM then becomes disadvantaged in the new world because it inherits this big company orientation and that lagging behind. So the opposite side of power is what you inherit. From [inaudible 00:32:01] can be the wrong thing. But a source of power is that. A source of power can be an invention, a source of power can be a particular customer base that you have identified. It doesn't last forever, power, but all the different sources of advantage that are sometimes transitory and sometimes permanent are sources of power that a company has to use to compete and survive.

Lenny (00:32:35):
I imagine people listening are just like, oh man, I got to figure out the power, the advantage that I have with my business. Is there any advice you could share about helping people figure out where their power might lie?

Richard Rumelt (00:32:46):
That's a good question, Lenny. So how do you figure it out? So I start, as I said earlier, with the symmetries. In what way is my company different than other companies? In what way is my team different? What do we know that other people don't know? What do we possess that other people don't possess? So there has to be some asymmetry to create competitive power, there has to be something different.

(00:33:17):
Sometimes you have to redefine your space down small amount. Then you can actually see it, particularly a smaller company that doesn't have worldwide power, has power in a certain marketplace or a certain set of customers or sometimes it's not customers. Sometimes the power isn't who you can bring in and hire. So if you invented ChatGPT, you can bring in the smartest AI people for a year or two because all the smart AI people want to work at the cutting edge with the current winner.

(00:33:58):
Then they'll start to arguing with each other and in fight and there'll be all sorts of embarrassing personnel things going on and someone else can grab that position, if it's not well managed. Business is exciting in that sense that it's not stable. It's not just as it was when I was first studying it. It's not just IBM and Sears and AT&T forever. There's a constant changing of the guard.

Lenny (00:34:30):
For better or worse.

Richard Rumelt (00:34:32):
For better. Because if you look at government, there is no changing of the guard and they get stultified.

Lenny (00:34:38):
Makes sense. So in your book, you have this whole list of types of power. I'll just read them real quick. Leverage, proximate, objectives, chain link systems, design, focus, growth, advantages, dynamics, inertia, entropy. There's also the book, obviously The Seven Powers, that a lot of people are aware of. I guess how do you think about just the spectrum of types of power you can have? Is this it? Are there others?

Richard Rumelt (00:35:02):
I started to make a list there in the book and I wrote up a bit about chain link systems and today, I mean the power that new business models are exploiting is the power of the user base. What we called years ago, network effects, where the more users you have, the more useful a product is. So I think the idea of network effects first arose with the telehealth system, which the idea was that you don't want to be connected to a telephone system that only connects to two other people. It's not all that useful. It's got to connect to the world to be useful.

(00:35:43):
And my colleague Marvin Lieberman was taking the economics course at Harvard University at the same time that Bill Gates was a student in that classroom. Professor's going on about network effects and of course that's what catapulted him, had his software, MS DOS at the time. Not MS DOS, he had something called basic that... The network effect was huge. He got angry about the network effect because people wouldn't pay him. They kept stealing it and using it and pretty soon everybody in the microcomputer industry had M Basic.

(00:36:27):
Then we get the network effects from not just software, but user base is now with the internet and so you get network effects with big social media. No one wants to be on a social media if only three other people are on. So having a large network...

(00:36:50):
Amazon. Get big fast because the economics are amazing. So we used to say, well, in a department store, economics are that you're saving people the cost of going out of the store and walking down the street to another store. So now it's all in one place. Supermarkets, the same thing. But look at a thing like Amazon where there the ease of shopping on Amazon keeps people from leaving it and going to another website. Now other websites have gotten better and better and some of that is less strong than it used to be and this is a constant struggle with it. Nevertheless, the size of the user bench there is an important source of a symmetry and power for the people that have come out ahead and won that battle for this round, this five years to 10 years. How long does it last before some other thing begins to take precedent. And now we have two-sided markets, whether it's credit cards or places where both buyers and sellers get together.

(00:38:01):
And so here these big forces that companies are playing with right now are these network effects.

(00:38:10):
And when the new generative AI, we have the possibility of stronger effects than we've ever seen before, but we don't know yet. But the suspicion is that size is what matters, that the size of the data that you could put into the learning algorithm is going to make your AI better. And so again, a big... It's going to matter.

(00:38:43):
Just think of Google and their ability to improve search based upon all the searches that go on on their base every day. It's very hard for Bing to catch up because Bing doesn't have as much data to train on. And so unless there's some new innovation there that isn't just the amount of data, the leader again has this asymmetry working for it. Now, the way you get around all that is by being specialized, by owning a particular approach that isn't the market leader's approach. And it's always been that way in business, but our attention is often attracted by these giants.

(00:39:34):
So yeah, sources of power today where we look at the new business models that are part of the fabric are these network effects and things like that that are very, very strong. And people are trying to get those in startups and in small firms within a certain market space and build it as fast as possible to get ahead of others. There's been venture capital available to try those experiments and some of them work and some of them don't, but that's this new age we're in now, where the speed of building a market position with network effects is a dominant game in the tech space.

Lenny (00:40:25):
I feel like Twitter is the ultimate example of the power of network effects, especially recently where if you think about it, everything about Twitter has changed and it still continues to run. You laid off 80% of people at the company, they changed the name, they changed the domain basically, the algorithms changed. I don't know what is still the same.

Richard Rumelt (00:40:45):
How can you lay off 80% of the people and it still runs? I mean you got to wonder.

Lenny (00:40:49):
I love Twitter. I'm on there all the time. I feel like it's never been better, which is kind of wild.

Richard Rumelt (00:40:54):
Twitter's fascinating. I mean I tune into it every couple of days and see what's going on and it is just an amazing rumble of opinions and statements. It's much more interesting than it was five years ago.

Lenny (00:41:11):
There's a lot of diagnosing and not a lot of concrete actions. But anyway, I wanted to come back to the element about power. I think when people are thinking about power, it may not be clear where that plugs into the diagnosis, the guiding policy and the coherent actions. Where should you be thinking and implementing this idea of where my power is when you're laying out your strategy?

Richard Rumelt (00:41:35):
To undertake a strategy that you think will work, you've got to have a reason that it makes sense and that reason is derived from some source of power, some source of advantage. Ultimately, your power or your advantage is something based in history that has the feel of reputation, or institutional skill, or it's some kind of symmetry or knowledge that you have that others don't have. So it's a resource that you can use that your competitors or others don't have equal access to because you've either have mastered it or you own it or you inherited from the past.

(00:42:45):
All those things are sources of the power that you use to make it not an even bet. So when you walk into a casino, well maybe if you play poker with skill, you can expect to make some money, but the general casino games, you're going to expect to lose. And in business, statistically, if you come to me and you say, I'm going to open a new restaurant. What should my strategy be? My answer would be don't open a restaurant. Invest in the S&P 500 because the statistics are that new restaurants fail. So what makes you think that you can succeed? Oh, I really want to succeed. Not good enough. I trained under a chef who's been very successful. Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more.

(00:43:50):
So there, where's the asymmetry here? Where's the source of power where you go from the odds... The standard odds in this game are against people where you think the odds are in your favor.

(00:44:05):
That's the source of power we're looking for. We're looking for this information, this skill, this thing in the field, the way the resources are arranged, that's going to give you this edge. And some of that is sort of part of the situation and some of it's how you shape and focus your actions. Strategy tends to be surprising when we see it, when we see it work, and surprising because we don't expect it. We expect people to bumble around. We expect Arby's to bumble around. We expect nation states to bumble around. We don't expect them to execute coherent strategies.

(00:44:54):
The United States went to Afghanistan and it wanted to catch Osama bin Laden, but at the same time they didn't want to put an army in the shield to actually catch him because it would the embarrassing to have that many Americans in the field. That's what happened in Tora Bora. The Secretary of Defense said, no, we don't want to make it look like we're taking over the country, so they didn't try to catch him as hard as they could.

(00:45:22):
And we want to have the education of women and we want to have a democracy and we want to have a long list that we would have no opium production, but at the same time, our allies are the opiate producers. It was the Taliban that got rid of opiate. Americans didn't do it.

(00:45:44):
So we had all these different objectives. It doesn't work. You need to have a focus on something achievable. What's achievable? [inaudible 00:46:03] Nation-building is hard stuff. It takes a century. Afghanistan, I'm off on a tangent here with Afghanistan, but it's a really interesting subject. Afghanistan was a warlord society, a bunch of different warlords running the place. Well, what's a warlord society? Where else do we look for an analogies? Well, we look at [inaudible 00:46:32] in 1650. You look at France in 1300. You can look at Japan before the modern era. These are warlord societies. Well, how did they go from that to being a coherent government that maybe wasn't democratic at first, but still, there was a government instead of just as much war. It took some [inaudible 00:46:59] to conquer all the rest.

(00:47:02):
And then it took a long time for them to put in the structure itself of government and then maybe became a democracy. Maybe not, but that's the process. It's not like you just go in there and say, you're now no longer a warlord with society because we've decreed it.

(00:47:19):
I don't know. You're going to ask me more questions about what it is people should know and how do you get these sources of power? How do you get these insights? I'm a big fan of history. I'm a big fan of knowing things about what happened. Business history, biographies, war history.

(00:47:42):
If you don't have access to other times and other places and other things that have happened, it's very hard to think strategically about the situation you're in because there isn't a science of strategy. It's not like physics. It's not like engineering where we can write down the equations of stress on a beam and say, how thick does the beam have to be? It's not like that. A lot of it is based on analogy to previous human experience.

Lenny (00:48:16):
That is an amazing insight. Is there anything you find most rich and valuable in terms of history periods, empires, stories that you find most connects as an analogy? Is there anything you find consistently is useful or is it just read as much as you can and you'll often find something in there?

Richard Rumelt (00:48:36):
Yeah, the further back we go in history, the leaner. It's less rich. The best histories are written by the people at the moment it's happening or very soon after. History books and things like that are someone's opinion. But our own history here in the United States, we have pretty good documentation about what went on in the Indian War, why we had these big cycles of economic growth and then depression. We had depressions in 1840 and after the Civil War and there was another huge panic depression in the 1890s. [inaudible 00:49:26]. A lot of people don't even know that these things happen. How did they happen? And of course everybody knows about the Great Depression of 1929, 30's, but go back and how did that happen? When did that happen? And you'll hear professors opine about why it happened, but there's no agreement. The biggest economic fact of the last 150 years, you don't know why it happened.

(00:49:58):
Go back and you can go online and look at the Wall Street Journal of the New York Times from that era and start in September of 1928 and just look at the front page every day, which I've done, and you can see it unfold and it's a surprise to everyone. There goes, well, Ford just laid off the people, but it's temporary. They'll hire them back. This economist says, well, it's a temporary this. It'll come back. And it gradually gets worse and worse and worse and there's no understanding of it. There's not a lot of analysis. And so you got Milton Friedman saying, oh, it's monetary. They didn't loosen up the money supply. You got other people saying things. But put yourself back at that moment in time and see what people saw and realize that no one understood what was happening and to form their own opinions.

(00:51:10):
That's the diagnosis skill or that's the feeling. Now, let's suppose you fall off a boat. You're on a cruise ship and you fall and you're now in the ocean. It's terrifying and it's confusing and there's waves and there's water and I don't want to drown. And you look around and you see, oh, here's a floating piece of wood. Let me grab it. Wow, that feels a lot better. That's how it feels when you look at a confusing situation and the first idea of how to understand it comes to mind. Oh, yeah, I've got this piece of wood. Now I'm not drowning. But is it right?

(00:52:05):
The most important intellectual tool we have is to think again, to say, okay, I came up with this diagnosis because I thought this and I thought this. Is there another way to look at this situation? Is there a bigger piece of wood over there than I can grab onto? That's the hard thing. When I looked at the Great Depression what I saw is the [inaudible 00:52:35]. So if you look at capital goods, most capital goods that the public buys, the adoption curve goes up like this, it peaks, and it declines and then it comes back up again. Because there comes a point where everybody who can afford one has got one, and then the new sales drop off. And in my mind, that's what I saw. 1929, everybody could afford a car, had a car, and the auto industry began... First signs of the Great Depression were in the auto industry.

(00:53:15):
So that was my play that I read. Now I don't see anybody else writing about that, but that's the exercise and to exercise your mind about trying to understand complex situations. It's best to go back. You don't have to [inaudible 00:53:34] to the great Depression, but you can go and try and find situations that other people have to deal with and look at as much data as you can and to practice that. That's what education should be in a business school. It's not. They teach theories now because it's so much easier to teach a theory than intellectual structure.

Lenny (00:53:58):
It's also a lot more work, reading a lot of books and history and studying and thinking.

Richard Rumelt (00:54:04):
Oh, [inaudible 00:54:05]. I had a colleague at UCLA who assigned a book to MBA students and they went to the dean and had him kicked out of the course because of a book. He wants us to read a book.

Lenny (00:54:16):
Oh man. It sounds like you have another book in you writing about the Great Depression and what really happened there.

Richard Rumelt (00:54:22):
Maybe.

Lenny (00:54:23):
Oh, man. Exciting.

(00:55:24):
I wanted to zoom back in on something very tactical. So say you're a product manager listening to this that has to write a strategy for their team. Say it's like they're working on the onboarding experience of their product and they're about to sit down and start to write out the strategy for their team. And say they have a general idea of what they want to do. Do you have any advice for just how to lay out a strategy? As you talk I think of there's a section. Diagnosis, a section. Guiding principles, a section. Actions, and then there's power in there and the guiding policy. Is that how you lay it out? Do you have any advice for how to write this out?

Richard Rumelt (00:55:59):
I wrote the crutch because I felt that.

Richard Rumelt (00:56:00):
The Crux because I felt that that kernel was not sufficiently sharp enough for peak. And even in The Crux, if I could rewrite The Crux book, I would, maybe, write it a little differently today, a whole couple of things I would change. First, it's really important to understand the challenge, the problem. Diagnosis is not merely understanding the world, it's understanding the challenge you face. What makes it hard? So the question I ask client is exactly that. What makes it hard? Client will tell me, "Oh, we want to open up business in Australia. It's a market we haven't tapped." And I'll say, "Okay, so why are you and I talking about that? You're the CEO. Just tell somebody to do it. What makes it hard?" "Oh, well, we don't know anybody in Australia and they kicked us out." If you push, he'll tell you why it's hard.

(00:57:18):
But that understanding hasn't been percolated into a strategy. Part of the problem is that the concept of strategy has been so beaten up by thousands, hundreds of books, and thousands of more websites that people have a hard time trying to figure out how to create a strategy, because they're drawn up, down, left, right. So my two pieces of advice, anybody that's actually trying to do this is, A, state the problem, and, B, don't call it a strategy, call it an action agenda, that you're not creating a strategy, you're creating an action agenda. What are we going to do about this problem? That's essence of what you're doing. When you're thinking strategically, you're recognizing the problem and you have an action agenda to deal with it. It's not five years out and 10 years out. It's not your general mission to build a better world, it's none of that.

(00:58:43):
All of that is a different literature form. There's huge numbers of people out there willing to sell you advice on how your mission, and your vision, and your values, and all these things that have to be in place before you can have a strategy. And that's not true. It's a different model. I start now with ambitions because people want to put ambitions in place. They get angry with me. I don't allow them to talk about their ambitions. So we start with ambitions, and okay, you have all these ambitions. I write in The Crux that when I was 25, I wanted to be a top business school professor. I wanted to be on Fortune directors. I wanted to drive a Morgan Drophead Plus 4. I wanted to climb the great mountains of the world. I wanted to learn to fly an aircraft. I wanted to marry a beautiful woman and have successful children. I wanted to have a townhouse on the [inaudible 01:00:00] of Paris. All and all, I had a lot of ambitions.

(01:00:05):
That's not strategy. We all have ambitions, and every company should have ambitions. If we look at all those ambitions, and let's say I'm 25 years old, well, what's keeping me from reaching them all? "Well, I'm not ready to join Fortune directors. I'm not experienced enough." Okay, so I put that over here. "I can't afford the pen." Okay, put it over here. "How about the ambitions that you have any chance of making progress?" So now, well, beautiful woman. "Yeah, I don't know any, maybe I ought to meet a few." "Well, you can do something about that."

(01:00:52):
So which of your ambitions can you begin to make progress towards reaching, and what's holding you back? What are the barriers? What are the problems? So I approach the question of the problem now through the filter of the ambition, that these ambitions, fine, let's accept them all, and which one can you actually make some progress on today? And what's making that hard? What are the challenges? So you're choosing a challenge. You're choosing, of the possible challenges you could face up to, you can't do them all. So there's a focus thing. You're choosing which challenge to focus on, and that challenge has to be, A, important, and, B, it has to be achievable.

(01:01:48):
It has to be something that you can address. It has to be an addressable challenge. And so the search for an action agenda, I'm not calling it a strategy, is this balance between problems that are important because they're close to your ambition and problems that you can actually address and do something about. And that overlap then becomes the choice you make. "Okay, we're going to go after this and here's the action steps we're going to take to do that." And if it's a big company, the action steps may extend over two or three years. Smaller company, took [inaudible 01:02:32] year, six months to a year. These are things we're going to do, not goals we're going to achieve. These are things we're going to do, action steps. That's sort of the way I put it together today, which is slightly different than the way it's put together in The Crux.

Lenny (01:02:49):
Yeah, I love this advice. That's such a simpler way of thinking about strategy. It's an action agenda. "Here's the things we're actually going to do." And then it starts with the challenge. And just to talk about The Crux briefly, The Crux is named after this concept in mountain climbing of the hardest point of the mountain climb where people, if they get past that, it's all downhill. And I think basically the point there is focus on the most challenging, like the biggest challenge that you need to overcome to achieve these ambitions you're describing. Is that roughly the way to think about it?

Richard Rumelt (01:03:21):
Yeah, yeah, and the idea comes from a design, and it comes from climbing, because I used to be a climber, a rock climber, and a snow climber, and a crux in a climb is the hardest part, the hardest pitch or a pitch, the hardest move is the crux of that piece. And then the basic advice to a climber is if you can't do the crux, don't do the climb, because you're going to fall off there. Now that's not exactly true, because you can try it over and over again until you get it. But in general, particularly if you're looking at an alpine climb, you better not take it on a climb where you can't handle the crux. That's why people go bouldering. The [inaudible 01:04:06] still up to him [inaudible 01:04:08] crux.

(01:04:11):
And so that's what the concept of the crux comes from. Now in business, the crux is the hardest part of the problem. And from the design point of view, the skilled designers, whether they're an engineer or an architect, what else? There's usually a challenge. I. M. Pei was hired to take a look at the Louvre in Paris, and they had a dusty parking lot in the center of this giant palace that had become a museum, and they wanted an entrance to Louvre there. And the problem is he didn't want it, they didn't want a new building that would obscure the Louvre itself. The building itself is part of the story, it's part of the scene. And yet at the same time, they needed to have an entrance, because the entrance at that time was off on the side wall.

# How to be more innovative | Sam Schillace (Microsoft deputy CTO, creator of Google Docs)

## Transcript

Sam Schillace (00:00:00):
We tend to undervalue the things we're good at. We tend to think work has to be unpleasant. And so if something is easy and fun, we don't tend to think it's valuable. So I think lots of people gravitate in this direction of like, let's go do unpleasant things and grind our way through the career because that's the way to make it. But the reality is you should go do the thing that you feel guilty to get paid for, if there's a thing like that, and do the hell out of it, right? Do it as hard as you can. If you get pleasure from doing something that people want to pay you for, do it the best you can do it, as hard as you can do it. And if that's messing around and playing around with cool ideas, do the hell out of that. Work doesn't necessarily have to be hard.

Lenny (00:00:37):
Today my guest is Sam Schillace. Sam has an incredible resume that is very hard to summarize succinctly. I'll give it a shot. Currently, he is corporate vice president and deputy chief technology officer at Microsoft, where he leads efforts in the consumer product space, infrastructure, and AI. Sam is most known for basically inventing Google Docs with his company Writely, which was acquired by Google, and became the foundation for what is now Google Workspace, which currently has over one billion active users a month. 

(00:01:06):
After joining Google, Sam ended up responsible for many of Google's consumer applications, including parts of Gmail, Maps, Automotive, Groups, Reader, and more. He's also founded six startups, was senior vice president of engineering at Box through their IPO. He's also worked at Intuit, Macromedia. He was even a VC at Google Ventures for a time. As you'd suspect, we had a fairly wide-ranging conversation, but the core focus was around innovation, how to think big, how to come up with original ideas, why optimism is so important and powerful, and also a ton of career advice. Sam is hilarious and not what I imagined a corporate vice president at Microsoft would be like, which gives me even more respect for Microsoft. A big thank you to Brett Berson for making this introduction. With that, I bring you Sam Schillace, after a short word from our sponsors.

Sam Schillace (00:03:51):
Thank you. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:03:53):
A really fun fact about you is that apparently you have the very first Google Doc file. I don't know what you call it. The very first Google Doc document saved somewhere from before even Google Docs was a thing. And does it still work in today's Google Docs? And what is in this document?

Sam Schillace (00:04:08):
Yeah, it does actually still work. It's pretty funny. Actually, if I move my camera for a second you might, if you're on YouTube, you can see the Writely thing in the background. Writely was the company that did Google Docs. Yeah, it still works. And it's funny though because it's like the document of DCS, right? So we started off 2005, wrote this thing in C#, which is a little known, in our own... It was pre-cloud, so we had three file servers that we rented that were Windows machines in a data center in Texas with a sysadmin in the Philippines running them. So it started there.

(00:04:43):
And then when we moved to Google, we ported everything to Java, we moved all the data over into Bigtable. And we didn't lose anything. We never lost anybody's stuff. So it's still there and moved across. And then so that's one backend migration, and there's another one with Spanner. And then the front end has been rewritten twice as well. So it's like, is it really the same document? I don't know. The front end, back end have been rewritten. It's not much. It's just me saying something to Steve about, is collaboration working? Are we colliding on each other? Because we were trying to figure out typing on one line, if that algorithm was working.

(00:05:14):
And then there's a picture of Edna from The Incredibles pasted into it. I don't know why. I think that came after, so I might've gone back and pasted that in. I'm not sure when. We must've been testing pictures or something. Unfortunately, we don't have the version history anymore, so I don't know what was original, original. But it is the oldest Google Doc from October 2005 or something like that.

Lenny (00:05:34):
I love that this philosophical answer of, is it still the same Google Doc, considering all the code has been redone.

Sam Schillace (00:05:42):
Well, the Computer History Museum wants to curate it. I talked to these guys and they were like, "Oh, that's so cool. We'll take that." I'm like, "How?" I can make you a PDF. Now it's not the document. I can share you into it, but please don't edit it. How do you curate this? So that's funny.

Lenny (00:05:58):
Yeah. It needs to be on the blockchain.

Sam Schillace (00:06:00):
Yeah. Yeah. If you made the NFT of it, that would be more authentic, I think, than the document almost. It's kind of funny.

Lenny (00:06:07):
That's amazing. And it's amazing that it still works. That's a testament to, I don't know, you/Google.

Sam Schillace (00:06:12):
Well, I'll tell you a quick Google story. When we migrated in to Google, we were very sneaky about it, and we put the site into "maintenance mode" for eight hours on a Sunday, where everything was just read-only. And then we migrated all the data and moved everything and brought the new system up. And three days after that, Sergei was in a meeting with me and he's like, "So when are you guys going to move over to Google infrastructure?" And I got to tell them, "Oh yeah, we did it this weekend." No one noticed. Some blogger in Germany noticed that the IP address changed and that was it. Nobody noticed it at all, so we were really good about it.

Lenny (00:06:46):
Man, I love these sneaky stories. I'm hoping we hear more. There's a bunch of stuff I want to cover, the first is this broad idea of disruptive innovation. I know that you spend a lot of time thinking about this. Google Docs is a great example of this. It feels like Microsoft increasingly is getting really good at this. Just the idea of doing something completely new, oftentimes things that people didn't think were possible. So let me just ask a broad question. Why is this important to you? Why do you spend a lot of time thinking about this? And then just what are some tools you've found to help you and other people think more innovatively, more originally?

Sam Schillace (00:07:18):
It's an interesting question. The why it's important part, I don't know, it just is. Everything you're wearing, eating, using, listening to, sitting on, was a disruptive innovation at some point. That's how everything happens, right? I think there's this really interesting thing where everything new is threatening at some level at the beginning. I mean, probably literally the first guy who invented chairs got shit from his tribe mates for making a chair. And they're all obvious in retrospect, right? Everything is obvious in retrospect.

(00:07:51):
But I think there's this really deep thing that people have where if something is disruptive of your worldview, it feels threatening, and you have this very stark choice to make that's either you're wrong or it's wrong. And humans are storytellers. It's very easy for us to tell stories about why something is right or wrong if we're motivated to. And so I call these why-not questions. People ask these why-not questions a lot. So a new thing pops up, and if you're not ready to receive it for some reason, you're not already half there or you don't have a problem that it solves or whatever, it's just threatening and irritating, and you come up with a why-not question.

(00:08:29):
We heard a bunch of these with Google Docs, with Writely, in the early days about the browser wasn't ready, people wouldn't... The whole model of the cloud was like, people aren't going to trust you to store your files. That's really weird. What if there's no connectivity? I heard the no connectivity on an airplane story 100 times from journalists. Like, "What if I'm on an airplane and I write stuff?" I'm like, "I don't know. There'll be connectivity on airplanes soon." Which there is. And those are all just why-not questions.

(00:08:55):
I think the more interesting ones are the what-if questions, like, what if this does work? Just use your imagination. Think about, how far can I extend the curve? What are the implications of that? I'm an engineer, and engineers are fundamentally pessimistic people. Somebody once told me engineers come into the world broken. They just look at everything as a problem to be solved. And I think there's something to that. But I feel like I've missed out more by being pessimistic than I have by being too optimistic too early.

(00:09:26):
So I have this kind of mantra now that there's just not that much of a prize for being pessimistic and right, particularly in a moment like this. It's much better to be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right, I think. So I don't know. And I'm an impatient person. I'm a creative person. I'm a messy person. I just like to create and explore and find stuff. So disruptive innovation just seems natural to me. But I think it's not an exaggeration to say, literally, that wheat you had in your bread this morning, if you eat bread, some weirdo was messing around with plants 1,000 years ago and everybody thought he was a nut, or she was a nut, and then we had wheat because somebody... Just everything, right? Everything is like that.

Lenny (00:10:12):
Along the same lines, I was actually just working on a post around first-principles thinking. And I found this quote from Steve Jobs just reminding us that everything around us was designed by some person that wasn't necessarily that much smarter than you. And there's no reason there isn't a better way. It just happens to be the way it is today.

Sam Schillace (00:10:26):
Yeah. One of the other ones that I like to keep in mind is every new idea looks dumb at first. Unfortunately, the dumb ideas also look dumb at first. It's not a perfect [inaudible 00:10:35]. But the more disruptive they are, the more dumb you're going to feel they are. You always listen for stuff like if they say it's a toy or if it's practical or it's stupid or I don't get it or whatever, those are often... Toy is a good keyword. If you hear people saying something's a toy, that's often a really good signifier that it's actually something real and threatening, and they can't think of a better criticism for it than it's just a toy right now.

Lenny (00:11:01):
Yeah, I imagine people thought about Google Docs that way initially. It was like, "Oh, this little toy in the browser."

Sam Schillace (00:11:06):
Yeah, we got all this stuff. I mean, the real interesting thing, like I said at the beginning, you have this very binary reaction that's possible, right? You either understand it, in which case, you're super excited about it like, "Cool, the world's going to change in this exciting way." Or you don't and you reject it. And to the degree that something is really disruptive, that reaction, that binary reaction gets really strong. And so with something like G Docs, we got this thing with G Docs that was really confusing in the early days to me, where there was a small group of people that really liked it. Some of them liked it more than we liked it. Nate Torkington over at Writely was this super huge early booster for it. And I did not understand what he saw in it at first. But then we had people that just wanted it to die in a fire. 

(00:11:52):
And that bifurcation of love it, hate it, is really how you have an idea of whether you have impact in what you're building. If you get more of the bell curve of modern indifference and maybe mild like and mild dislike, that's an's an incremental product. That's not really disrupting anything. But if you look at something like ChatGPT where the entire world is like, "This is amazing." Or, "This is terrible." And there's not a whole lot in between, that's a very good signifier of it being truly impactful and disruptive. Whether it's actually good or bad is a separate question. But there's no denying that that's a disruptive technology.

Lenny (00:12:33):
That's an awesome framework. Basically, if it feels like people sort of like it, mostly people don't care, very few people love it or hate it, probably not disruptive. If some people absolutely love it and a lot of people really hate it, good sign.

Sam Schillace (00:12:45):
Right. Yeah. Actually, weirdly enough. It's not voting, right? In the early days, we had, I don't know, a couple of million users, five million users, and there were still executives at Google telling me that it was a stupid idea and that it should stop and we shouldn't be doing it. So, for a long time, the haters outnumbered the people who were fans. And who cares? Whatever. It's fine. As long as you don't run out of the people who love it, that's fine.

Lenny (00:13:18):
Is there another example of you using this what-if approach either on a product you worked on or something you've seen and it working out?

Sam Schillace (00:13:25):
I'm doing a lot of it right now, honestly. I mean, that's probably the most immediate example. But I could almost point at any product and there's moments like that in there. But right now there's a lot of why-not stories, right, around generative AI. So it's expensive, it hallucinates, you can't necessarily... It's sarcastic, it's random, it doesn't do the same thing twice. Yeah, they're real, they're actual issues to solve, but I look at it and think, "Well, what if? What if we can build software around it? What if we can build more complicated programs than what we've been able to build? What if we actually have a reasoning engine that we can use to do meaningful things? What if this is really the second Industrial Revolution where, in the first one, we had a surplus of physical energy beyond just our bodies and things like water reels, and now we have a surplus of cognitive energy beyond just our brains, right?"

(00:14:17):
And that's a really transformational idea. So I'm completely in that mode right now, honestly. I think that's just the right mindset for something that's obviously this disruptive, right or wrong. Tesla is a great example. SpaceX is a great example where people are like, "That doesn't make any sense." And Elon's like, "Well, what if you could land rockets and reuse them and they get really cheap? That's pretty amazing. What if I can fix the battery problems and a car is basically a software product, right?" Those are pretty amazing what-if questions, right, of those products.

Lenny (00:14:49):
Yeah. So in this work on understanding what first principles actually looks like when you're thinking from first principles, the steps are essentially, figure out what you want to do, figure out the levers that keep you from achieving that thing, and then basically question every assumption that stands in the way of making this possible. So I think Elon's a great... The classic example. You can't talk about first-principles thinking without quoting Elon, telling stories of Elon. But essentially, it's just, okay, how much would it cost to make this if we were to start over and not...

Sam Schillace (00:15:16):
I mean, the why-nots, there are actually problems you need to pay attention to eventually to build stuff. But once you have the what-if, right, just to pick on SpaceX for a second, right? If you have what-if of like, "If I could make payload to space cost a lot less, what if?" Okay, that's amazing. That's an amazing world. Let's see if we can work on that problem. And then now you have all the why-nots? Why not? Why isn't it as cheap as it could be? And you can start to break the problem down and think about it that way. It's a good model.

Lenny (00:15:46):
This connects to something else that I know you're big on, which is optimism, being optimistic. There's this feeling that pessimism, you're often right. There's growing pessimism in the world in a lot of ways, especially in technology. I know you're a big proponent of staying optimistic. Can you just talk about why you think that's important and how you approach that?

Sam Schillace (00:16:06):
It's funny, it's a choice. I'm not an optimistic person by nature. I'm just not. All the people in my life, if any of them listen to this, they'll just laugh at the idea that I'm a proponent for optimism per se. It's just a conscious choice. I don't think you get very much for being pessimistic necessarily. You definitely don't get a lot for being careless. You can be optimistic to the point of being careless and causing harm, for sure.

(00:16:33):
Maybe a better way to say it is growth mindset, right? You want to look at the possibilities rather than the limitations, and suspend some disbelief and just work on these problems. I just personally feel like I've missed out on more than I've protected myself from. If I sum up both sides of that equation over my career, I wish I had been more open-minded and more optimistic, and more willing to try things, and more focused on possibilities rather than problems.

(00:17:00):
And so I'm just personally choosing to do that, try to do that as a habit. Nothing deeper than that. I just think it's a better place to be, particularly... It's kind of funny. When I came out here, I was pre-med. I dropped out of school. I came out to be a computer scientist with my friend. I didn't think of it that way. I came out to have a job at Ashton-Tate with a friend of mine, and spent 10 years not understanding that I was actually in a career and thinking that it was a temporary thing where I had to go back to med school and get my degree and be a doctor or something boring like that. And so for 35 years of doing this, it hasn't occurred to me that, oh, actually, I'm in this computer industry that's this technical industry that's constantly growing and constantly inventing things and constantly coming up with these new ideas. And actually, the best posture in that world is to be creative and curious and open and optimistic and try things and stuff like that.

(00:17:54):
The other thing I'll say about optimism too is related to doing these disruptive things like G Docs. Going back to this idea of all the good ideas look bad at first. Okay, so that's a first principle. That's a sort of fundamental thing of you're going to constantly be challenged by the really good ideas. So how do you overcome it? Well, one way you can overcome it is you want to be able to try things more easily. So part of that is being more optimistic, so being more willing to try stuff, and part of it is also just making it cheaper to try things.

(00:18:26):
Very early story of G Docs, when I had the idea for Writely, my two co-founders who were both deep domain experts in both app building and word processors were like, "The browser is never going to support this. It's a bad idea. Let's not do this." And they were right and wrong at the same time. They were right that it didn't support even what we have today and wouldn't have supported a full experience, but wrong in that the world was going to change and evolve. And we would never have done the first experiment if it had been a long and costly thing to do, right?

(00:18:58):
So the fact that our tools were sharp and I could say, "Let's do this thing." And it only takes a couple of days to get it on its feet and see how it feels, it's kind of a form of optimism, right? If you're super pessimistic, you can be like, "Even that's not worth it. Two days is a waste of time." So there's always a little bit of a leap of faith. And then you want to make those as consumable as possible. You want to be able to try things out quickly and learn things and do these experiments. 

(00:19:23):
Now, lots of people have said that before, but I think all those pieces connect for me in this idea of being optimistic and open to trying stuff. Because stuff always is different. You're always wrong about products. That's one of my other rules is you're just always wrong. And so you have to try it. You have to put it in front of people. You have to try it yourself before you'll understand it. No one can really design products in their head completely as far as I can tell.

Lenny (00:19:47):
Awesome. There's a few threads I want to follow there. But this is also a tool that I found came up again and again in first-principles thinking, people that are really good at this, is just trying it. There's a lot of just, "Nah, it's not going to work." And exactly as you just described, you often find out you're completely wrong when you actually try it out. And you have this quote, I think in one of your newsletter posts, talking about building Google Docs. You describe it as just fuck around.

Sam Schillace (00:20:12):
Yeah. Kind of.

Lenny (00:20:13):
Get to the edge of something and fuck around. That's the strategy.

Sam Schillace (00:20:15):
Yeah. Yeah. Get to the edge is only... Get your tools as sharp as you can get them to be. Make it so that you can try lots of cheap experiments, right? And just mess around and see what happens, see what pops out. And just try to be observant. I think the other part of optimism too is there's a receptiveness to it, right? If you're very pessimistic, you might miss the surprising result that pops out of an experiment. You might force yourself to do a bunch of experiments grudgingly, but you're like, "You know what? I hate this. I'm doing four experiments today because I have to do it because I want to be an entrepreneur, but it sucks and everything's miserable and black." And then you won't notice that, oh, this thing didn't work, but it didn't work in an interesting way. And you're more receptive to that kind of surprising thing, I think, when you're in an optimistic frame of mind. Like, "Oh, let's see how far I can get with this. Oh, it's not working, but why isn't it working? Well, that's kind of interesting. It broke here."

(00:21:04):
And we've done stuff like that in some of the things, the projects I've got going in Microsoft right now, we've got a chatbot thing we've been working on for a while and with memory, long-running memory so that you can have long conversations with it. And they work okay, but they don't work great in some ways. And we were trying to get multiple versions of them working together, like multi-agents working together. And we gave them whiteboard working memory as a shared working memory thing to fix this problem. And that turns out to make them much smarter. Don't know why. It just makes them smarter. So that was one of these nice little bits of discovery where if you're in a pessimistic frame of mind, you might've said, "Well, these don't work that well, let's give up on it." More optimistic frame of mind was like, "Well, let's try to give them a whiteboard just like a person and see if they cooperate better." And it turns out they really do. So another example of that mindset.

Lenny (00:21:54):
Along this thread, I was going to ask about this earlier, but there's a lot of technologies people get optimistic about. Crypto comes to mind, not that there's nothing there, but a lot of people got really optimistic and then it turned out there wasn't really a lot of business to be built and then things entered wintertime. Is there anything you've learned that gives you a signal that, "Lets keep working, I'm going to stay optimistic about this thing?"

Sam Schillace (00:22:15):
I spent a lot of time really thinking hard about crypto and whether I was just reacting to it because it threatens some part of my identity or whatever. And I never came down to anything that seemed valuable. I mean, that was always the thing for me is just there has to be a what if that I can say, "Well what if this works? How valuable is it?" And for crypto I was always like, "Well what if it works? Then I have to run up sec on my personal finances. That sounds dystopian. I don't want that." I can't think of anything as a user that I think actually is valuable here, even in the best case. So I feel like the pessimism is justified. 

(00:22:53):
So that's one of my other root principles is just like it's all about user value. Users are lazy, right? We're all lazy. We don't really care that much at the end of the day. No one's going to do something really in their life for any other reason other than it makes their life better. Nobody cares that you're friendly or nice or the logo is pretty or whatever. They care about making their life easier. We're all cynical at heart at some level, so if you can't point at user value, significant user value, it's not going to work. It doesn't matter. Shove all the marketing dollars into it you want, you can write all the articles you want, but it's got to actually solve a problem, a real problem, at the end of the day. I just never saw that with crypto.

Lenny (00:23:34):
Yeah. So I think the lesson there is truly understand if the value is real, versus, this sounds really cool, you think a lot of... Would you want it? I think is a nice exercise there.

Sam Schillace (00:23:43):
We pick on poor Elon, but I feel like with a lot of his products, at least he... He's got lots of other issues, but he articulates clear user value even in the beginning when he's hyping things up. Like Teslas, right? Okay, so electric cars weren't ready, he did the Roadsters, whatever. But he at least articulated this idea that we're going to put a lot of batteries in these things. They're going to really be real cars. They're going to have a real range. We're going to figure out the charging problems. As an end user I'm like, "Okay, that's great. Now I have a car that works like a car that solves some problems that's way cheaper to operate, because the fuel is cheaper. He's solving all the end user problems for me." That at least makes sense. Even if you don't believe that he's going to do it or believe in the way he did it, at least the end user value proposition makes sense, right?

Lenny (00:24:32):
You have this other great quote in your newsletter, "People are lazy. Look beyond cool too, on how much easier new tool or tech makes someone's life. Convenience always wins." Can you talk about that, just this realization people are just lazy and that's the key?

Sam Schillace (00:24:44):
Yeah, well I mean that is the thing. I think as product builders, it's hard to not love what you're doing. You build a product because you love it, you build it because you understand some problem, you build it because you want a paycheck maybe sometimes. But we build it for all these reasons that just do not matter to the end user at all. And if there's one thing I've learned about product, particularly in the consumer space, just kind of in general, is people are just lazy about stuff and don't care about anything other than it making their life better. The thing that's complicated with that is there's two things about it that I think are interesting that follow from that principle. One is, I think products almost follow these thermodynamic rules where if you add a little bit of value, your adoption goes slowly and if you add a lot of value, your adoption goes really quickly, right? 

(00:25:32):
I think ChatGPT is a great recent example of something that was just added a ton of new value to the world and got this explosive growth, and then you see lots of other AI stuff that people are doing that's just not bad, but not great, and it's sort of kind of adding a little bit of value and slowly lumbering along, or maybe it's going to collapse under its weight. That's one thing about the users are lazy part of this. And then the other one I think is, again, it's almost like physics. I think of this as entropy, or people who are confused about entropy or will be like, "Entropy is not real. Look, it runs backwards all the time on earth. Life gets more complicated. What is the deal with entropy?" And like, "Well no, you have to consider the whole system, right? The entire system of the solar system, including the sun is increasing in entropy all the time. We're just making use of some of it."

(00:26:24):
And I think the same thing is kind of true about user laziness, where people are like, "This tiny thing that I'm focusing on, this feature that I added is better. Therefore, users should adopt it." But you forget all the stuff around it. The user has to hear about it, the user has to remember it in the moment. The user has to learn how to use it, they have to build the habit. That's all effort, right? Not to mention the fact that the actual use of your feature might have friction on the way in, right? It might be hard to sign up for it. 

(00:26:50):
When we did Writely at the beginning, we didn't even ask for an email address, because it was such a novel thing. We didn't want any friction at all in the onboarding process. So you could just come in and make a document and start using it without telling us anything at all about yourself. And after about two minutes of typing, if you're still there, we'd very gently just say, "Please give us your email address, no password, no anything. Just give us your email address so we can send you a URL of this document in case you care about it later. Because if you leave, we'll never know where... We'll never be able to find it again." 

(00:27:21):
But we were super focused on that, as little friction as possible. And I think it's well known in the consumer space, you don't have... The number of seconds you have is not many. 15 seconds, 30 seconds, right, to convince somebody that there's some value there. They're not going to hang out and grind their way through a bunch of high-friction stuff to sign up for your thing. That's the other part of it is just, users will only adopt what you're doing if that sum total of energy that they have to expend is less than the resulting ease in their life that they get, usually by a factor of at least a couple, right? So it has to make your life a lot better, hopefully a really a lot better, like 10X better than what you spend to use it.

Lenny (00:28:10):
What I think of as you're describing this is, Microsoft Excel had a billion toolbars and buttons and options, which allowed Google Docs essentially to come in with a much simpler experience. Now you're on the other side of that, which is I didn't think about.

Sam Schillace (00:28:25):
Yeah, it's a really funny place to be. And it's funny to be at Microsoft, because I'm kind of the enemy, right? Because I'm the guy who messed them up a little bit. So there's some friction around that. Yeah, I mean I think there are similar trade-offs to be made right now, by the way, with AI. I think there's similar opportunities. But we made this choice with... So it's a little hard to remember, right? Because it's like 18 years, 17 years ago now, 18 years ago almost. In that era, Office was impregnable, right? So software had to be distributed physically, right, it had to be shipped around, it had to be bought and installed. It was harder to use.

(00:29:01):
And so there's a very high transactional cost. Because there's a very high transactional cost, the buyers would always make this decision like, "Do I want the thing with 1,000 features or the thing with 995 features? I don't know what those last five are, but I might as well have all of them." And so that was just the lock-in for Microsoft, right? So we made this trade-off, we're like, "Look, we're easy to use, we're zero install, you don't have to ever deal with it, it's super convenient. Plus you get this one new feature that's really, really useful, which is collaborating with each other and not having to send attachments around the old file servers, but we're going to take away most of the features, because we don't care about them that much." 

(00:29:39):
And we took away a little bit more than we should have. In the early days, we'd get all these complaints about people who wanted word count, which I thought was a really weird... I thought that was going to be way at the end of the list. We didn't have rulers, we didn't have any kind of formatting at that point, any real pagination. We just had these basic documents. But page word count came in, of course it was students, was one of our early adopters. So they really wanted to know if they were at the word count for the essay that they had just had assigned to them.

(00:30:06):
So there was this dance with Microsoft that we deliberately made this trade-off. And I think it's almost like a classic innovator's dilemma model, right? We had this incumbent that was asymptotically approaching usefulness, they're adding stuff. Whenever they added stuff, it wasn't really that much more valuable. And then we were this small thing that came in into a market that they didn't care that much about, that they didn't understand that well, which is the internet stuff, this disruptive new thing. We just chipped away from the bottom, like the innovator's dilemma. And I think it was hard for Microsoft to respond to it. I think it took them a while to even have a clear idea of how they were going to respond to it. In retrospect, they did fine. We took a bunch of market share, but they kept all the money basically. So we being Google. So they survived it. They did a good job surviving the challenge. We have all the users now, but they have all the money. We have all the money, I guess now.

Lenny (00:31:07):
I want to spend more time on Google Docs and the story there. A couple questions. How long did it take from starting on it to feeling like it's working? Whatever you consider product market fit.

Sam Schillace (00:31:17):
Almost immediately, honestly. It was weird, the process of it was, I had this idea, we set this thing up, we started working together. We're like, "Ah, that's actually pretty..." So basically history is like I noticed contents editable, so the browser would do some editing for you. And then I noticed JavaScript, I never realized that JavaScript is out there. And we had done word processors in the past, this team, and for a long time. In fact, my co-founder, Steve, the other person on that document, wrote this thing called Full Write way back in 1987 or something like that, that was a direct competitor. '85 I think even, that was a direct competitor to Word one. 

(00:31:57):
So we knew word processors, and so we decided to just try it. What's it like to build a word processor? And the fact that you could collaborate on them was kind of an accident. They're just these things on the server. We hadn't built the thing that would lock somebody out yet. So there was just like, "Here's a document, you can edit these two things." Which we, A, immediately realized was really cool. We could both work in the same document at the same time. And then, B, realized, "Oh, crap, we're colliding with each other, because there's no presence or anything like that. And there's no collision detection or anything like that."

(00:32:26):
So pretty quickly we're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool. That feels good as a development team to have these shared documents, not to send stuff around and not... So that's cool. So let's build that out." But like, "Oh, bummer, collaboration's a problem. We'll have to go fix that." And naively figured out that that's a problem. And it took forever to get that working. It was really, really hard in the time, because we didn't do operational transform. I don't think that technique had been quite invented yet. And so we did three-way merge, which doesn't work that well, because the browsers... The logical document, a document can be rendered differently in HTML. There's not a canonical representation. 

(00:33:04):
And so you're doing merges where alphabetization can change, the order of attributes can change, the tree structure can change. Firefox would do a blank paragraph with a singleton BR tag, and IE would do it with an open closed paragraph tag. And so even the tree doesn't match. So it's a really hard merge problem. So that turned out to be a gnarly hard problem to solve. But once we had seen the value of working together, we were motivated to do that.

(00:33:32):
The interesting thing too with that is, I think if we'd gotten it in the other order, we might not have done it. It's another good example of why not and what if, right? Where we got really lucky that we saw the what if part, that we saw how cool a document in a browser that you could collaborate on would be, because if we understood how hard the collaboration piece would've been first without understanding that value, we might've been like, "Eh, it's not worth it. It's going to be so hard to solve that problem. It's probably not a useful app." So I think it's a good little counter example of that optimistic, pessimistic perspective we were talking about. We could easily have missed that idea, easily have missed that idea. And we just got lucky I think in the order it got presented to us.

Lenny (00:34:16):
That is really interesting actually, that you need to be pulled to the what if getting you so excited that you're going to spend however many years it took you to solve that problem, because you are so excited about this what if. I think that's a really good-

Sam Schillace (00:34:31):
Yeah, yeah, I mean I've spent a lot of time. It's kind of funny, I keep expecting people to just be like, "All right, grandpa, stop talking about G Docs. It's been a long time." Right? So it has been a long time. It's been 17 years, but it's still very relevant. It's got a couple billion users now I think, it's a big thing. But I've spent a lot of the last 10 or 15 years just thinking about, why did that work? What worked about that? What lessons can I draw from it? There was a lot of energy around it, positive and negative. The first week I was at Google, an executive there refused to give me hardware, because he thought that Google was an app company not a... It was a search company, not an app company. And literally the guy in charge of hardware at the time refused to give me hardware for this service. And I had to threaten to either sue him or haul him in front of Eric Schmidt, because I had a contract and I had contracted earnouts.

(00:35:20):
So that was another one of these interesting lessons of sometimes the opposition is enormous. And if I had just been a random Google employee with this idea and no legal protection, and the CEO wasn't a fan of the project, it would've died. There's no way it would've made it through that negativity and that pessimism and that person being either challenged or afraid of the idea, or just not able to imagine it, or what. I'm not sure what. But we'll keep coming back to this idea of optimism, but I have this very strong feeling about that most of the reason people don't do really innovative good products is this kind of mindset. You're just not seeing the opportunities.

(00:36:02):
There's a lot of hard work for sure. There's a lot of stuff that you can read about and best practices of doing iteration and user testing and user interviews and really listening and all the engineering best practices. That stuff is pretty mechanical. Once you know where you're going, you can do that. It's not that hard to learn and to master it. I think the hard stuff is this mindset of being open in the right ways and understanding that some kinds of pushback are good pushback. Some are bad. 

(00:36:32):
I always think that product builders and entrepreneurs, you have this really hard problem of you have to be very rigid about your mission. I know where I'm going. I know what my mission is, and I'm going to go there because the world doesn't care, it's going to push back. But you also have to be really flexible about feedback. You're probably aren't going to be right about a bunch of it. And so you have to blend these two things together somehow. It's like a samurai sword that's hard on the back, but softer on the edge so it doesn't break. Or the other way around I think. But there's this hard thing you have to do as an entrepreneur, and I think it's the real core of building really great products is finding that balance and really listening to those signals, being open to it.

Lenny (00:37:16):
And also knowing how long to commit to it versus time to move on to something else. So along those lines, what was the moment where you finally felt product market fit for what became Google Docs, and how long was that from the beginning of starting to work on it?

Sam Schillace (00:37:30):
It depends on what market we're talking about. I've been continually surprised at the adoption of G Docs. I think we knew there was something there pretty quickly, probably in the first couple months. There was a lot of energy around it. It was a weird ride, because we built this thing on a whim, and as an experiment. We liked it. We decided to go just advertise on Google. At the time, 37signals was the cool company. And we're like, "That looks cool. We'll just be some engineers and we'll have a little subscription SaaS business thing and chill out. So let's see what it costs to acquire customers. So let's go advertise on Google and see how much it costs to get people to sort of show up, and then we'll figure out if we have a subscription business or not."

(00:38:12):
And that just got us noticed. That got us noticed by Google. It got us noticed. We were I think one of the first 10 articles at TechCrunch, like Michael Arrington. Another funny story is that I had a breakfast with Michael Arrington at Bucks, in that era where he was trying to decide, he had this spreadsheet idea he wanted to work on and he was trying to decide he should go do that and maybe join forces with us, because we were cool, or if he should continue to work on this blog thing he had gone called TechCrunch. So I might be partially responsible for TechCrunch, because we turned him down and said, "You should go do TechCrunch instead." Every time I would bump into him, I would laugh about that one. 

(00:38:50):
But when we got noticed, we really got noticed. There was just this period where we were the hot thing for a couple months, where every VC wanted to talk to us and everyone's trying to figure it out. Because I think we're like... When you see one point on the line, like Gmail, which came before us, you're like, "Oh, that's kind of cool. That's an interesting quasi-app." But it's like a weird kind of app. It's serialized. You can't really interact with it that much. And then you see this as another point on the curve and you're like, "Oh, that's a real app. Oh, crap. I wonder, is there anything stopping us from doing the rest of Office? Oh, probably not. How far is this going to go?"

(00:39:27):
And so I think we were that second point that showed that there was actually this totally different paradigm. And so we just got this enormous amount of tension pretty quickly. And then the rest of it was feeling our way through what does it actually mean? How much of the functionality do we need to build? What's the really important part about it? How much of its collaboration? We spent a bunch of energy on offline, which was miserable, which never turned out to matter that much. 

(00:39:51):
Now that team has spent a long time replicating all these features that we abandoned by the wayside, which I think I'm not that interested in. I think the future of documents looks very different than what we have now. I think it's kind of funny now that we're spending billions of dollars on GPUs to emulate wind pulp and ink pressed by metal type. We're building linear documents that are fixed, that are static. So one of the things we've been doing with these chatbot things is they also serve as documents. I say bots or docs all the time. And so you'll do these things where you... I do this all the time, where we'll interview... We'll create a new one. It has a separate identity, as a separate document, and then you tell it like, "I'm going to write a technical document. Here's roughly what it's about. Why don't you interview me?"

(00:40:35):
So it interviews you for an hour, and now you've got this nice linear artifact which you can read. It's very readable because it's conversational. But at the same time, you've been building all these semantically encoded virtual synthetic memories in the Spectre database. So you can come in and say, "Show me a diagram of this. Draw this diagram for me, change it in the following way. What is this? If I change this, what if I change that? Summarize this part of it." So you can start to interact with it. That's still creating stuff at the bottom of this linear artifact. But the next step that we're working on now is just making that dynamic where you just come to something and you talk to it and interact with it. 

(00:41:12):
I think one of the things that's going to happen is, just like it seems... Well, in the early days of G Docs, people would say, "Well, what if I'm not connected?" And one of the things I would say is, "In three or five years, if you get handed a device that's not connected to the internet, your word for it is going to be broken." Which is true, right? It's anachronistic and weird if something's not connected. I think we're going to feel the same way about intention and interactivity in our products very soon. If I can't tell something what my intent is and have it configure itself in an intelligent way, have it converse with me, whether that's a device or a piece of GUI UX somewhere, I think it's going to feel anachronistic. It's going to feel really weird. 

(00:41:55):
There's that scene in one of the early Star Trek movies where Scotty tries to talk to the mouse, right? He's like, "Computer make the..." He's pissed off because he can't talk to the computer. We're all going to be like that in five years I think, about it. And it's going to seem really weird that we have these applications that I can't collaborate with the application. Why can't I collaborate with the applications? It's like the application's locked on a file server just like the pre G Docs days. Why can't I just interact with it and have it configure itself the way I want it to configure itself, and show me the data the way I want to see this, and let me build the workflow the way I want it, and remember it for me and bring it back later, and all that stuff? So that was a long digression, but I would just like... You're asking about features and functionality, and I feel like where we are now with these feature wars, it's just silly. It's not the point at all. I think documents are going to change radically in the next few years.

Lenny (00:42:46):
I want to follow that thread. Before I do, I found the first TechCrunch post about you guys. Starts with, "Imagine Word, but as an Ajax browser application."

Sam Schillace (00:42:54):
Oh, yeah, there you go. Yeah. It wasn't even JavaScript. It was Ajax.

Lenny (00:42:58):
Ajax, so hot back then.

Sam Schillace (00:42:59):
It's also funny too, because I'll talk to young front end developers these days. I'm like, "I don't want to scare you too much, but jQuery didn't even exist when I wrote this thing. This is like bare metal in the DOM, and there were bugs." When I went to Google, I had to write this little network stack at the bottom of the JavaScript that in theory [inaudible 00:43:21] you could interrupt, you could have multiple requests inflate and you can interrupt them and discard them and stuff. 

(00:43:25):
But the stack at the time was really buggy, and I think it was IEE. And so I wrote this little network queue that would keep track of whether there were requests in flight, and kill them in a way that didn't break everything. And it was hard to do, because it's this weird asynchronous programming. And that piece of code, when I went to Google, they made me reformat it for the JavaScript readability standards, and I could not get it to work with their formatting. There was some bug in the JavaScript compiler of the time that whitespace mattered. And so I wound up checking it in broken, got the readability badge and immediately fixed it. It's like that was another one of our little hacks to get this working.

Lenny (00:44:06):
I love it. This episode is brought to you by Ahrefs. Many of you already know Ahrefs as one of the top tools for search engine optimization. It's used by thousands of SEOs and companies like IBM, Adidas, and eBay. What you may not know is that there's a free version that was made with small website owners in mind. It's called Ahrefs Webmaster Tools. It's free and it can help you bring more traffic to your website. Ahrefs Webmaster Tools will show you keywords that you rank for and back links that you can get.

(00:44:58):
There's often this criticism as an engineer, you just want to work on interesting things and work on the technology before you find a problem that it's solving. It feels like with this example it was, you just think this is a cool technology, let's see what happens. Do you have any, I don't know, learnings or advice for when it's actually fine. Let's just play with this tech, be at the edges, you said, and maybe it'll lead somewhere, versus you should probably try to avoid that and first focus on a problem.

Sam Schillace (00:45:22):
I'm guilty of that. I mean, I like to play with stuff. I tend to think with my fingers as much as anything else. So I actually think there's a good place for just play with the tech a lot and figure out what it's good for. What I've evolved to doing these days with my teams is I pick what I call north stars that I think are interesting, useful things to get to rather than just messing around. What's a cool thing that I think might be buildable with this? 

(00:45:49):
So right now we're doing these multi-agent systems. We're trying to figure out how much independent work they can do without a person holding their hand. And so a nice domain to test that out in is programming, because you don't have a whole lot of... You just give something a Python environment and a file system and that's it and that's all it needs. And so you're not distracted by connectivity issues or whatever.

(00:46:11):
So one of the problems right now is go write the eye in Python. That's a problem I could give to an intern and it would take them a summer to do some halfway decent job of it. It's a thing you could expect a reasonably competent programmer to do, mostly independently. And so it should be possible for the system, if it's independent at all, to go do that. So is that useful by itself? No, because we already have the eye, it doesn't matter. But if we build a system of programming agents that can self-monitor and self-correct and bug themselves, that can build things that are roughly that scale of complexity, that's valuable. That would be a valuable thing to have. 

(00:46:43):
It's kind of interesting too, because that system already, it's produced a bunch of good insights. One of them is its kind of complicated and then hard to debug it. It's this asynchronous system of stochastic agents. That's a lot of stuff to deal with. So we wrote a debugger agent. And debugger agent watches stuff, and when there's a problem somewhere, it goes and figures out what the problem is and then gives you a nice explanation of what you broke and what needs to be fixed. And we haven't turned it loose on actually fixing things yet because we don't trust it, but it's very helpful as an assistant [inaudible 00:47:15]. We had one that documented itself too. That's the other one we did recently. Just turned it loose on documenting the code base and did a pretty good job of it.

(00:47:21):
So it's starting to produce interesting stuff, right? Because we have these north stars that we aim things at. And I think that's maybe a good antidote to this. Just playing with tech without being focused doesn't tend to produce anything that's super valuable. But picking these, even if they're arbitrary goals, as long as they're real goals that you're trying to get to, that's useful, right? Where you're like, "I wonder if I can get this to work. I wonder if I can build this thing." Then grind away at that for a week and see how close I can get. See what I learned about why it's hard. That's probably better than just like, "Let me poke at JavaScript for a while."

Lenny (00:47:59):
It's also different, I think, at a bigger company where you need to achieve something, versus I think as just an engineer out of college just playing around, like, go for it, right? It's just like, what's the worst that could happen?

Sam Schillace (00:48:09):
Even the early days of Writely, the very... I mean, we had a goal from the beginning. The beginning was like, "Can I write a word processor in a browser?" That was literally the problem statement, right? It was like, "I have content edible, I have Ajax or JavaScript. Can I put these together and something that feels like a word processor? Let's go do that." It's kind of half messing around with tech, but it's also half an actual goal. So I don't know. 

(00:48:35):
I like playing around with... I think a lot of the good product ideas, most of the good product ideas actually come up from engineering. So I think there's a lot to be said for, get familiar with tools, particularly weird esoteric combinations of tools can often be useful. If you understand or three things... At Google, I was one of only two people in the company who had the code readability, which is the right to check in code in this language, and both a backend language, which is the monitoring language, Org Mode, a middle tier language, which is Java, and a front language, which is JavaScript. No one else would do that full stack. I think it's useful to have that broad perspective sometimes.

# Inside Gong: How teams work with design partners, their pod structure, autonomy, trust, and more

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00):
Before you came on, I asked on Twitter, what should I ask Seth Godin? The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. How do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves?

Seth Godin (00:10):
AI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. What AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make a difficult promise, a remarkable promise, and then how do I keep it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26):
You wrote a new book. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it.

Seth Godin (00:31):
Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. What we do when we launch a new product, we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51):
There's the section that stuck out to me, these four insights that basically determine what your life is going to be like outside of actually building the product.

Seth Godin (00:59):
For a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11):
Today my guest is Seth Godin. Seth is an absolute legend. He's published 21 books, including 18 international bestsellers. He's been blogging every single day for almost 10,000 days in a row now. His writing and his advice have inspired me and so many people all over the world for the past few decades. He shares wisdom and advice around stuff that everyone can benefit from, including how ideas spread, when to quit, how to lead, how to stand out, and most of all how to change everything. In addition to his writing and speaking, Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. He also started the altMBA program, and as you'll hear in our conversation, he actually started his career as a product manager. In our conversation, Seth shares advice on how to know if you have good taste and how to build your taste, how to build a brand in an increasingly crowded world of AI startups and AI content, his thoughts on the Jaguar rebrand and also the Tesla Cybertruck.

(02:10):
We also delve into his new book, This is Strategy, including why every great strategy has tension at its center, why you need to understand the systems within which you operate in order to build a great strategy and how choosing your customers, your distribution strategy, and how you validate your idea will inform the product you build and the life that you live. We also talk about how he used Claude as a writing assistant in developing this new book.

Seth Godin (02:55):
What a treat, Lenny. Thank you for having me. Lenny was my late mom's nickname, so it's good to say that out loud.

Lenny Rachitsky (03:02):
That's so cool. I've never heard it used for a woman, and every Lenny out there I've met is wonderful, so I imagine she's wonderful. First, I just want to say how honored I am to have you on this podcast. When I actually started this podcast, I was like, and I was listening to you on Tim Ferriss at that point, and I was like, man, what if one day I get Seth Godin on my podcast? How cool would that be? I've read so many of your books. I have a bunch of them in the bookshelf back there. I reference your stuff all the time, so thank you again for doing this.

Seth Godin (03:29):
Well, thank you. It's a treat to talk to you.

(05:18):
I want to start by asking a question that one of your former colleagues suggested I ask you. Wes Kao. I imagine you remember Wes?

Seth Godin (05:25):
Of course. Wes and I sat in a room just the two of us for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (05:29):
So what she suggested I ask you, and this question I love, is she... I asked her, what did you learn most from Seth Godin working with him? And she immediately said, it's helping her build better taste and increase her standards, having really high standards. So I want to ask you first of all, just how do you know if you have good taste and high standards and then how do you build good taste and higher standards?

Seth Godin (05:54):
Great question. Thank you, Wes. I define good taste as knowing what other people want just before they do. So if you're the only person who wants peanut butter covered licorice, you're entitled to eat peanut butter covered licorice, but you don't have good taste because everyone else thinks that's weird. And people, whether they're jazz musicians or fabric designers are seen as having good taste when they bring something to the world that the world didn't necessarily expect but is glad to see.

Lenny Rachitsky (06:25):
What do you find helps? So Wes learned from watching you that she realized, okay, my standards are not nearly as high as they could be. Other than working with you, maybe that's the answer is work with people like you that have really high standards. Just what do you find is most helpful in helping people build taste and also just increase their standards?

Seth Godin (06:46):
Standards, it's worth understanding what quality is and the people who listen to this podcast know better than most. Quality is not luxury. Quality is not perfection. Quality means meeting spec, and if you meet spec, you're done. If you don't think the spec is good enough, make a better spec. But if you meet spec, you're done. And so what it means to have high standards is that you relentlessly improve the spec in service of the people you're working with and for.

(07:16):
And what it doesn't mean is that you take something that meets spec and refuse to ship it because you're a perfectionist. That's hiding. And so what I learned at Spinnaker where I had my first job, real job as a product manager, was this idea that we weren't there to make perfect for us. We were there to delight the person who was buying the software. And our standards were untouchable. We said, "If that person, the one we're describing is delighted with what we shipped, it's good. And if they're not, it doesn't matter what kind of excuses we have." This is the opposite of what most people in this job do, which is they say, how do I please my boss? And if you're just doing your job, then don't expect to get rewarded for more than just doing your job because we can find lots of people who can just do your job.

Lenny Rachitsky (08:10):
That reminds me of one of your other really powerful pieces of advice about how no matter your job, this is a tangent, but it really stuck with me once I read your advice here is no matter what job you have, you couldn't love it, enjoy it, be amazing at it, even if you're just like a waitress or whatever. Can you just talk through that? Because that's so powerful.

Seth Godin (08:29):
Well, I think I got it from the late Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., and the idea is there's no perfect job. A friend of mine, Tim, is a famous jazz saxophonist and he's got to schlep from city to city, and he's got to play to half empty rooms and he is got to deal with this and deal with this. So you're never going to have unlimited artistic freedom. But what we all have is the ability to understand where the boundaries of our work lie and go there.

(09:01):
And if you're a barista and you've chosen to be a barista, maybe because it's the best thing you could get, well you're not going to get the next hour over again. So what would it be like to be the best barista in the world for an hour? Would that be worth it for you? Because I've had menial jobs in food service and I got to tell you, when the boss forces you to be mediocre and bored, there's no amount of money they can pay you to do that job. But if you're there and you have a chance to add delight to someone's day, you're doing that for you, not because you're getting paid.

Lenny Rachitsky (09:34):
And you could totally tell these people in the world when you go to a barista that just you can tell, just loves their job. I know imagine she knows this is not her career long-term, but she just embraces it and just has fun with it. There's so much power to that. On a different note, you mentioned that you were product manager, which I did not know. That's amazing. So most of the people listening to this podcast are product managers. They're either product managers, founders, people that want to be founders, and then people that work with product managers. So first of all, I guess could you just share that part of your life? Because I don't think people know that.

Seth Godin (10:05):
All right. So the origin story could take all day, but I'm not going to tell the whole thing. I'm going to tell the part that I thought was normal that turned out to be the luckiest thing in the world. The summers between the two years of business school are very important to establish your career arc. I got a job at Spinnaker Software. Spinnaker invented educational computer games. I was the 30th employee. And the summer was spent doing assistant brand manager kind of stuff, going to meetings with the ad agency, writing copy. But at the end of the summer, they had a lovely going away party for me, because I was flying back to California. And then at the end, the president of the company, the chairman of the company and the head of marketing bring me into this side when they say, "We have a secret project, we want you to work for us while you're at business school and we're all going to pay you almost nothing."

(10:52):
"Okay, what's the secret project?" "We're going to do computer adventure games with illustrations and music based on science fiction novels, and we've already acquired the work of Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke." Now, I had read every science fiction book in the Clearfield Public Library from Asimov to Zelazny. This was a dream come true, but they thought my job was going to be make the packaging and run the ads. And what I discovered, first of all is that I couldn't really go back to business school. So I showed up hardly at all at Stanford and just took a lot of red eyes. But I discovered that the engineers, the development team, they had a lot of people vying for their time. And if I didn't figure out how to get them to give me way more than my fair share of development, I wasn't going to have any products to make next Christmas and then I was going to be out of a job.

(11:46):
And so I started a newsletter internally, I was one of the first people in the world to have desktop publishing because I was a beta tester for the Mac, and in it I would mention anybody in the engineering team who had worked on my project and I would say something good about them. And then I would print it out and put it in every single person's inner office mailbox. And within three months, four months, partly because the project was really good, 40 engineers were working for me and no one was reporting to me. And so I became the de facto product manager and that is when I learned marketing is the product. You don't make a product and then hand it to some marketing yahoo and say, go put a logo on this. That the product we made, and five in a row went gold, saved the company. Though product is why it worked.

(12:38):
And so I was supposed to know how to code but I didn't, but I could be in the room. The last month, RadioShack had bought how many units? 3000 stores times five times five, a lot of units. And if we had missed a date, they were going to cancel the order and the company would go bankrupt, and the software wasn't even close to done. And we didn't have any source control like we do now. There was no cloud, so it was all in my head. So I did not leave the office. I'm not exaggerating this, I did not leave the office for the last 22 days, slept for four hours a night upstairs, and if anyone had a question, I could tell them who to talk to.

(13:19):
That was so thrilling. It was so thrilling to make those decisions, to cajole this team, none of whom were in it for the money, to make something we were proud of. And then the stuff ships, everyone else goes home to sleep for a month, but I am the project manager and the marketing guy, so I got to stay at work. And the next day the phone rings and it's Herbie Hancock on the phone, the great jazz musician, and Herbie says, "The receptionist said you're the person in charge of Fahrenheit 451." And I said, "Herbie? I'm 24 years old, man. Herbie?" And he went on and on about how he had stayed up all night to play it and that he loved it.

Lenny Rachitsky (14:00):
I love how natural of a product manager you were in these things you shared of just thinking everyone deflecting credit and all these things. It's sign of a great PM. Along these lines, I wanted to ask actually, so you're a PM early on. Now, you obviously spend a lot of time marketing. I know you're saying there's obviously a strong connection between the two, but is there anything you find that people building the product most often miss or misunderstand that just annoys you or do you think they need to hear?

Seth Godin (14:26):
Maybe I got seven, but I'll try to do them off the top of my head. The first one is this, empathy is not about kindness and empathy is not an option. This is something that you are making for other people. So the whole idea of RTFM, read the manual, I'm angry at you. If you're saying that to your customers, you made a mistake, they did not make a mistake.

(14:49):
The second one is that the thing about projects is when you run out of time and you run out of money, the project is over. Don't run out of time, don't run out of money. Good intentions are no reason for an extension. The professional doesn't ask for an extension because the professional understands that things you didn't expect are going to happen. That's part of the deal.

(15:14):
And I guess the third one would be for software, particularly software as a service, if you don't build the network effect into what you are making, you are almost certainly going to fail. You cannot hope that Apple's going to pick you, promote you, and magically have you be successful. The question is, will this work better for my users if they tell other people about it? And if the answer is no, then why would they tell other people about it? And if they don't tell other people about it, no one's going to hear about it. But if the answer is yes, then your marketing problems pretty much solved.

Lenny Rachitsky (15:51):
I feel like each of these is its own book that we could talk through. And I want to come back to this last point and how it relates to the purple cow. I want to spend a little time there, but first I'm going to ask a marketing question. So before you came on, I asked on Twitter, what should I ask Seth Godin? He's coming on my podcast. I got a flood of suggestions. The most recurring theme actually had to do with AI. Actually the co-founder of Intercom asked this question and it echoes what many people are wondering. So his question is how do you think all these new AI companies build brands to distinguish and differentiate themselves in a world that's increasingly filled with AI companies, AI products, AI content?

Seth Godin (16:26):
Well, the first question is what's a brand? Because it's not a logo. A brand is a promise. It's what do I expect from you. It's would I miss you if you were gone. And Hyatt Hotels has a logo, Nike has a brand. The way we know this is if Nike opened a hotel, we'd know what it would be like. But if Hyatt decided to make sneakers, we have no clue. They might be comfortable, but that's all we would know. And so if you want to build a brand, you got to stand for something and you got to say what you don't do. And the second thing is AI very soon is going to stop being a feature the same way electricity is not a feature. That lots and lots of things run on electricity, but they're not electricity companies. They just happen to use electricity.

(17:13):
So what AI companies and all companies need to do is say, what's in this for the user? What promise do I want to make? A difficult promise, a remarkable promise. And then how do I keep it? So making absurd promises might work at the VC level, but it doesn't work when you're talking to consumers because you can only break that promise one time. And so to wrap up the brand part, airlines don't have brands and airlines don't have loyalty. And the way we know this is that the only reason people stick with an airline is for the points, which is bribery. Loyalty is would you pay extra to stick with this? And if you wouldn't pay extra, then the brand has no value.

Lenny Rachitsky (17:58):
I love this phrase, make a promise and keep it. And the AI element, that raises the bar because many more promises are being made, fewer promises are probably being kept. So is the advice there, continue making an ambitious promise and then the key is actually deliver on that and that's what builds you brand?

Seth Godin (18:15):
Yeah. I have a very emotional connection to Claude.ai. I think they have a brand. ChatGPT's reputation with me is not good because it regularly over promises and under delivers and it does it without kindness or humility. Whereas Claude, I don't know how they did it, at least in my experience, brings kindness and humility. So when it doesn't know, it's very clear and it's not lazy and it's not angry at me. And so I happily pay extra for Claude because it has a brand. Whereas ChatGPT for me is just a tool that I use if I have no other options.

Lenny Rachitsky (18:55):
I love the Anthropic/Claude's billboards. "We're the ones without the drama." The AI company without the drama. I was going to save this to the end, but let's actually talk about it. So you mentioned somewhere that you actually use Claude to help you write this book and refine the book, which I think is going to increasingly happen. Could you just share that process of how you did that? What did you do that might be helpful to people to help you write this book?

Seth Godin (19:20):
Well, to be clear about my brand promise, because it's true, every word that has my name on it, I wrote. Every blog post, every book. I don't have a team. This is my whole staff is me. What I did with Claude and which I encourage people to do in the book is I would upload a list of four things and say, what did I miss? And it would suggest three things to complete the list. And often they would be things I hadn't thought of. And then I could go write about that or I would upload a couple chapters and I would say, what are the claims I'm making here that you don't think that I'm sustaining? And it became this patient editor that is so hard to find in the real world because editors aren't paid enough and given enough time to do their job right. And what I find is if I have a sentence that doesn't sound enough like me, I can ask Claude to help me figure out why that's true.

Lenny Rachitsky (20:24):
I love that tactic of using it to figure out what you missed. I feel like you agree with this. I find that when I write, part of it is I'm putting an idea out there. I want to see what I got wrong and what I missed. And I like that you basically skip that step and don't put it out and just make the thing you put out actually better.

Seth Godin (20:42):
Well, the thing about blogging every day is at first it felt like how am I going to keep up? But once I could build a queue because I didn't want my streak to end-

Lenny Rachitsky (20:55):
How long is the streak at this point, by the way?

Seth Godin (20:58):
Post number 10,000 comes out at the beginning of 2025.

Lenny Rachitsky (21:02):
Oh my God. In a row.

Seth Godin (21:04):
In a row. Some days there were two. But what I found as I got a little bit of a queue is that I would feel bad because I had something to say, but I couldn't because there was already one in the queue. So I shifted from I have to write something to I get to write something. And now because I've taken the pressure off, I have time to rewrite it because I don't have a shortage of ideas for tomorrow. I have extra ones.

Lenny Rachitsky (21:34):
This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the developer platform for building native customer-facing integrations with third-party apps. Our native integrations on your product roadmap, whether it's to ingest context from your user's external data and documents, or to sync data and automate tasks across your users' other apps, integrations are mission-critical for B2B software products today. But building these integrations in-house cost and average of three months of engineering according to the 2024 State of Integration survey, which results in difficult roadmap trade-offs. This is why engineering teams at Copy.ai, AI21 and over 100 other B2B SaaS companies use Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations. The result, they've shipped integrations seven times faster, all while avoiding the never-ending maintenance that comes with rolling your own integrations. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you accelerate your product's integration roadmap today and get $1,000 in credit on their pro and enterprise plans. That's useparagon.com.

(22:41):
So let's talk about your book. You wrote a new book. It's called This is Strategy. I've been reading it over the past week and I've been so into it that I actually left it at my mother-in-law's house. I don't have it with me. So it's called, This is Strategy. It's about how to build strategy and develop a strategy. There's a lot to love about the book, but the section in the middle that is what most stuck out to me that I want to spend a little time on. You have this four sequence of advice that I love, so I'm just going to read it real quick. Choose your customers, choose your future. Choose your competition and choose your future. Choose the source of validation and you choose your future. Choose your distribution, and you're also choosing your future. Can you just talk through these four insights, these four steps that basically determine what your product and life is going to be like outside of actually building the products directly?

Seth Godin (23:31):
Yeah. And for a product person, these are the critical choices and you probably have glossed over them. You have probably assumed it's a given and you've sacrificed your agency over the four most important things you should be choosing. So the first one is picking your customers. If your motto is you can pick anyone and we're anyone, if your hope is that you have to win SEO to get anything, you're not going to succeed. When you choose your smallest viable audience, what language they speak, how much money they have, what problem they're trying to solve, what their technical facility is, whether they're short-tempered, whether they're kind, whether they're going to stick with you, you have chosen everything that's going to go into the product and what your future is going to be like. And so the Humane Pin people, whatever it was called, made a mistake when they picked their customers because they showed up like they had a finished Apple-quality product and they were trying to appeal to the kind of people that would buy on pre-order a finished Apple quality product.

(24:40):
When they shipped something that wasn't that, and they knew it wasn't that, they're doomed. Whereas if you say, here we are in Product Hunt, we're only looking for 400 people. We're looking for people who like the Raspberry Pi. Who wants to wonk with this thing? Now you can dance and you can have all these other things happen because you picked a different customer. If you decide to be a wedding photographer in the Hamptons, well you better expect to have some very spoiled, cranky brides and grooms, and grooms and grooms, and brides and brides, that you have to deal with because you picked your customers. Okay, so then the second one which comes with that is who's your competition? Because if you're competing against Walmart, why are you surprised that they keep lowering their prices? That's what Walmart does, right? That way you decide which space that you're going to operate in. You've built an enormous set of boundaries around what you do.

(25:36):
The third one is validation. If you are trying to please your boss, that's what you're going to do. If on the other hand, you can have one difficult conversation with your boss and say, can we agree that I'm not trying to match your taste, I'm trying to match the taste of these 400 people that we've agreed are our customers? Every other meeting is going to go way better from now on because you've made it clear who you're trying to please.

(26:01):
And the last one, choose your distribution matters a lot in the software business. For example, a video game, which is where I started, we were in Target and Lechmere and mass merchants. Our competitors were in Ziploc bags in computer stores. Well, when something like Steam shows up, when something like downloadable shareware shows up, everything about your product changes. So again, these four things are choices, and if you're glossing over them it's because you're afraid.

Lenny Rachitsky (26:33):
And I think it's important to note, it's not like you can just change these at will and just like, okay, cool, we'll change your distribution. These are intertwined. But the important point here that I hear is just make sure the product you're building understands this is how you'll be distributed. This is who you're selling to.

Seth Godin (26:49):
Yeah, I mean, so a friend just sent me a business plan. They're making a food product and they're saying, we're going to distribute on Shopify and we're also going to sell to businesses, airports, hotels, and people who need to sell the food. I'm like, there's only two of you. No, that's not what your business... You got to pick, today, before you even turn the page, who are you for and who are you not for?

Lenny Rachitsky (27:15):
Along the lines of picking your customer reminds me, a friend of mine started a company selling a product to real estate agents and she just warned me, be careful who you're selling to because you're going to be spending a lot of time with these people. Make sure you're ready to be doing that.

Seth Godin (27:28):
One of my very first books was a advertising supported directory paid for by law firms. This is not something I want to recommend to anybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (27:38):
Another great nugget from the book that really stood out to me is this idea of tension. The importance of tension. You basically talk about how a great strategy has tension at the center of it. Why is tension so important to a good strategy?

Seth Godin (27:53):
Okay, so let's agree that tension and stress aren't the same thing. Stress is generally not good. Stress is two things at the same time, I want to leave, I need to stay. Right? I hate my boss, but I need this job. That's stress. Don't look for stress. Tension is at the heart of every art form and every innovation. Tension is it might not work. Tension is da-da-da-na-na, and the other person says, da-da. Because they need to finish the sentence.

(28:23):
So what we do when we launch a new product is we say, we have this thing that can do X, and now the person is imagining what their life might be like if that were true. If they fall in love with that possibility, now there's tension. Did you tell the truth? Is it going to work for them? And when I was a kid, PF Flyers were the sneaker to get, this was before Nike. And the promise of PF Flyers was that they would finally make you fast enough to run away from the bully. And I remember 10 years old walking into that shoe store and there was real tension in my head because I needed to get away from that bully, and I was keeping the PF Flyers people to their promise, and they didn't tell the truth.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:08):
It comes back to your point about not delivering on the promise that you make to build-

Seth Godin (29:08):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:13):
... A great brand, right? Okay, I want to take a little tangent into Purple Cow territory. I have your book right here, by the way. I have many of your books in the back, but I don't want to make my library... Oh, what is that? A milk carton?

Seth Godin (29:26):
This is the first 10,000 copies came in milk carton.

Lenny Rachitsky (29:28):
Oh man, I missed out on that. Was there any purple milk inside? What color is a purple cow's milk? We'll never know. We'll never know. I know you've talked about this concept a gazillion times. I feel like still people don't actually... Many people haven't heard it. Many people don't truly understand it, and it's the thing that I reference most of your piece of advice. Could you spend a little time just chatting about this topic of the Purple Cow, the importance of being remarkable?

Seth Godin (29:57):
Okay, so let's start with Steve Blank. I'm sure you've talked about his idea of customer traction. The single best way to tell if a startup's got any hope whatsoever is do the people who engage with you stick around? Do they come back for more? The second piece is, do they tell their friends? And if they tell their friends, what do they say? The word remarkable means worth making a remark about. So I'm not talking about coming up with some viral video that's ridiculous in its gimmickry. I'm saying if you make something where the person's life gets better if they talk about you and you know in advance what you want them to say, then they are more likely to say it. So Marissa Mayer probably created more stock market value than any other product manager I can think of. And the way she did it was there weren't very many people at Google, but she was the one who said, "No, you can't put another button on the homepage. There are only going to be two buttons on the homepage." And over and over and again.

(31:04):
At the time I was at Yahoo. Yahoo had the chance to buy Google for $10 million while I was there. That's a whole interesting story. But Yahoo had 183 links on the homepage and Google had two. And the statement built into that is we are making you a promise, and the promise is we are smart enough to take you where you want to go without you spending a lot of time browsing through 183 links. Tell us what you want and we'll take you there. And so I was a tech-forward person, and if a friend came to me lost on the internet, confused about something, I'd just send them to Google because I knew they wouldn't come back to me for more help, because okay, fine, they're gone. It's going to work. That's what to say about Google at its launch is, hey, just type in what you want and you'll find it. They built that into the product. That makes it remarkable because I wanted to tell other people about that because it would raise my status as a tech innovator.

Lenny Rachitsky (32:05):
And the implication here, and you talked about this, is that most likely the way you will win is word of mouth. It's hard to win with paid ads. It's hard to win with sales teams unless you're building B2B software. What you need to focus on is how to build something people tell their friends about. And the core of that is being remarkable. And I love just the way you break it down. Being remarkable is being something people remark about.

Seth Godin (32:30):
Yeah, and if you think it's just for small companies, that's how Microsoft beat WordPerfect, because Microsoft Word was the format you needed your coworkers to work in if you were using a modern computer, because if they insisted on using WordPerfect, then you were stuck with WordPerfect. Whereas they had a migration path and once you migrated, you didn't go back. So again, it's in my interest to insist you use Word. So I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (32:58):
This point about Mercer Mayer of doing this thing that was controversial, it comes back to your point of creating tension. It feels like it created tension both with visitors and internally. There's also these quotes that I have here that are along these lines that you've said in the past, I don't think they're in this book. If it scares you, it might be a good thing to try. And safety is risky. Is there anything you want to say there?

Seth Godin (33:22):
Well, so one of the things I talk about in the book is that systems are everywhere we look and they're largely invisible, taken for granted. I spend time with high school seniors talking about college. They don't see the college industrial complex. They just think it's normal, because that's what it is to grow up in the suburbs. And what systems do to protect themselves is they invent culture. Culture is the way things are around here. And so if you think something is scary, that's probably because the system wants you to think that.

(33:57):
And so you shouldn't do something foolhardy. You shouldn't be fearless. But what you should do is think about why does it scare me to do this? What system will be offended if I do that? Am I trying to work with the system or am I leveraged enough to help change the system? And so the first people who put up downloadable software, all the feedback was, you can't do that. It'll be pirated. You'll never make a penny. Okay. That might happen, and I can see why that feels scary, but I could also see why the dominant system of software distribution doesn't want me to even experiment with this. But I only worked on the software for five months, let's try it, because if it doesn't work and it gets pirated, I'll just have to make new software. It's okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:44):
It's interesting, the opposite of that was also true with Salesforce. Their whole pitch was no software. It's all in the cloud. Once that became the system, that became the tension and the risky move.

Seth Godin (34:55):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (34:56):
So you have this quote, actually. I want to spend more time on the system concept because it's so core to the book, and so core to your advice for how to be better, you have this actual quote. "What does it mean to be a strategic thinker? It means to see the system." What else can you share about it just for people that are trying to become better strategically, to understand what you mean when you talk about the system, how to see the system?

Seth Godin (35:18):
We have to invent systems anytime we engage with other human beings, because interoperability is essential. There's a system for how we greet other people in our culture. You shake hands, right hand to right hand. And just show up sometime and give the Vulcan salute instead and watch what happens. It's very awkward because we just needed to get this over with and now that's part of the system. And so systems serve a valuable function until they don't, because then the system starts doing things to support itself, to reinforce itself. So for example, there is a system that says we should interview people for jobs. And the most successful interviews are people where they show that they are like us, they look like us, they went to schools like us, they have privilege and background like us. That is toxic, because it diminishes not just diversity, but our ability to put real talent on the team.

(36:19):
And if you don't see that system and name that system, you're going to keep doing what you were doing. And I was talking to someone yesterday who said they had been working with a company and the last four people that they had hired had been captain of their Ivy League tennis team. Well, clearly there's a pattern here and it's being reinforced by people who don't want to get in trouble, but the system's not helping them. And so yes, we need the metric system and we need the zip code system. Those keep working really well. But if you are trying to show up in a place where dominant players don't want you to succeed, you're going to have to find something in the system that gives you a chance to change the rules.

Lenny Rachitsky (37:07):
This metaphor that I love that's along these lines of better waves make better surfers, that a lot of your success is driven by choosing the wave versus the skills that you have. Can you just talk about that?

Seth Godin (37:18):
Yeah. So it's surprisingly profound. I don't know where I came up with it, but when I see people who are great at surfing, they're almost always on good waves. And my son who surfs a lot, I have noticed, passes up waves that other people might take waiting for the right wave because he knows he will be able to surf it better. So when you think about which company you're signing up to bring software from, which people you're willing to put on the key roles, are you willing to wait for the superstar who's going to change things or are you in so much of a hurry to make an imaginary deadline that you're going to ship mediocre work? Because all mediocre means is average. And so if you don't want to be mediocre, you better do something different than the other people are doing. Otherwise, you're going to get what the other people are getting.

Lenny Rachitsky (38:10):
As you talk about this, I'm thinking about, I don't know if you saw Jaguar's rebrand and their whole launch. And it feels like it's been rejected by the system. Any thoughts on that? Maybe what they got wrong or maybe it was genius?

Seth Godin (38:24):
Okay, so you've picked a topic that I really like to talk about. Jaguar did not rebrand, Jaguar re-logo-ed. And the logo might be a sign that they're trying to rebrand and make a different promise, and they're switching to all electric, which I'm in favor of. But they made, I think, a very significant error, which is if you're going to start a car company, a hundred million or a billion dollars are going to get spent earning trust from people who never heard of you. If you're starting with one of the most iconic and beautiful and beloved car brands that has the luxury of having almost no cars in the world that could undermine what you want it to stand for going forward, it's perfect. Own that, that's brilliant. And to walk away from that so that you could please some art director, I don't understand why you think you're rebranding when you just put a logo on that undermines many of the awareness assets you already had going for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (39:28):
It feels like they got very, very controversial. They went against the status quo more maybe than they should. I don't know. What would you have done if you were them?

Seth Godin (39:36):
You may recall when the International House of Pancakes decided to falsely announce they were changing their name to the International House of Burgers and made a new logo, because they wanted buzz. This is a Wendy's Twitter tactic. Buzz does not sell hamburgers. Oreo's got a lot of buzz when they did that tweet about the Super Bowl blackout. There's no evidence they sold even one more cookie. They're not in the business of entertaining us. So Jaguar isn't going to sell more cars because people like you and I are talking about their re-logoing. What's going to make them sell cars is customer traction. What they need to do is find 50 people who have authority and get them in a car that changes them somehow, that transforms them.

(40:26):
And it's interesting if you think about two things that Tesla did right at the beginning with the model S. The first one is, according to someone I know who worked there at the time, the number one thing people would talk about when they saw you in the parking lot of the supermarket was the door handles, because the door handles popped out. They popped out in a way that's annoying and dangerous, but it was noticeable. So there was a conversation.

(40:52):
And then what would happen is they'd say, what do you think of it? And you'd say, get in the car and you'd switch to ludicrous mode and you'd drive at zero to 60 in 2.4 seconds and they'd start screaming. This was fun for you and told a story to the passenger. This is how customer traction begins because I can't do that in a different car, right? Compare this to the clown car, the Cybertruck, which was intentionally divisive and most people don't want to not only drive one but have one on their block because divisiveness is not selling. That what's selling is being of utility, to help someone get what they want. So here you have a category, the pickup truck, the number one category for all cars in the United States, just sitting there waiting to be taken. You can cross the chasm if you're someone like Tesla. And instead, they decide to pull a stunt, and that's not okay. It's not good product management. It's not good marketing.

Lenny Rachitsky (41:56):
Interesting. So you think Cybertruck are not going to be a success?

Seth Godin (42:00):
Well, I think, compared to what, right? So the Ford F-150 some years has made more than a hundred percent of Ford's profit, meaning without the Ford 150 pickup truck, there is no Ford. That's how big a category that is. You have a car with momentum and a public company where you've earned the trust of a lot of people. Now you have a category, pickup trucks, that are purchased for a very specific reason to show your neighbors you care about utility. Even if you never use the bed, that's the story of driving a pickup truck. So now, if you bring people in that category who are inherently skeptical of change and inherently skeptical of design trickery, something that is nothing but change and design trickery, no, they're not going to adopt it. You could have sold an enormous number of people who might've bought a Ford 150 instead. That crossing of the chasm is how you become really significant.

Lenny Rachitsky (43:01):
I feel like this alone could be its own separate podcast conversation. I wish we had more time. I'm going to ask one last question, and this is a quote that I found of yours that I also love that is reminiscent of Elon Musk, actually, as we were just talking about this. "The secret to leadership is simple. Do what you believe. Paint a picture of the future. Go there. People will follow." Can you just talk about that?

Seth Godin (43:25):
I might be a little too glib because what I need to highlight is the painting the picture of the future needs to be based in empathy. You can't paint a picture of where you want to go. You have to paint a picture of where they want to go, and it's this non-narcissism that is where professionals do their work. That you are not entitled to raise money, you're not entitled to have market share, you're not entitled to get a good price because you worked hard. What we can do is be of service. We can open the door to help people get to where they always wanted to go. It's very difficult to change what people want, but it's pretty helpful to offer people a chance to get to where they always wanted to go in the first place.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:14):
Seth, this was a dream come true. I appreciate you coming on the podcast. I appreciate you saying that. Where can people check out your book? Where should people go to learn more about what you're up to? Anything you want to share.

Seth Godin (44:25):
So I'm not active on social media, but I do have a blog at Seths.blog. If you go to Seths.blog/TIS, you'll find everything you need to know about the book and the strategy deck and the collectible chocolate bar and whatever other thing I've dreamed up in the meantime.

Lenny Rachitsky (44:42):
Chocolate. Seth, thank you so much for being here.

Seth Godin (44:45):
These were great questions, Lenny, I could talk to you all day. Thank you,

Lenny Rachitsky (44:48):
I appreciate that. Same. Bye everyone.

# Why AI is disrupting traditional product management | Tomer Cohen (LinkedIn CPO)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I think it's so underappreciated, the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I check it at least 10 times a day. What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:06):
I start backwards. It's like what is the potential here? If you start from the premise that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Is there anything tactically that would just like, wow, that really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post, share interesting content?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:25):
To really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products. This is not a traffic jumpstart, it's not an upsell feed. It's really about people that matter, talking about things that I care about professionally. The first thing we did was really making AI first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:43):
So it wasn't like, "Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?" It was like, "Let go of what you've built. Go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
There's so much I want to dig into here. Is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:57):
AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's really about...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today my guest is Tomer Cohen. Tomer is chief product officer at LinkedIn overseeing all teams responsible for building and creating LinkedIn products and experiences, including product development, design, business development, content creation, and customer operations. During his tenure at LinkedIn, Tomer was head of the mobile team, led the effort to revamp the LinkedIn feed and to many people surprised, made it extremely interesting in a place I check regularly. And he was also at the center of shifting LinkedIn to an AI first mindset, which started way before AI became cool. In our conversation, Tomer goes inside the strategy behind the transformation of LinkedIn's feed and how they approached making it a place that people wanted to check and make it much more social.

(00:01:49):
We also get into the one mindset that Tomer credits for helping him rise so quickly within LinkedIn. Also, why Tomer's most repeated mantra is, "We might be wrong, but we are not confused." And so much more. This episode is for anyone wanting to see what great product leadership looks like and wants to be inspired to think bigger. A big thank you to Shira Gasarch, Dan Roth, Josh Redfern, and Sparsh Argawal for question suggestions that made this episode so interesting. With that, I bring you Tomer Cohen.

(00:02:24):
Tomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:27):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):
Absolutely, my pleasure. So as I was preparing for this podcast, I reached out to a bunch of people that have worked with you and asked them what I should ask you on this podcast, and interestingly, every single one of them said this one thing that I need to ask you, which is about this phrase that apparently you use all the time. So first of all, can you guess what this phrase might be?

Tomer Cohen (00:02:47):
I have a few. Sometimes people call them Tomerisms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
Tomerisms.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:50):
But probably I might be wrong but not confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:54):
That's the one. Amazing. Okay, so let's talk about this phrase.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:58):
I don't say it so much anymore. I think it's ingrained into the cultures.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):
I was going to say that.

Tomer Cohen (00:03:03):
When they think of me, they think of this sentence already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:04):
Those are the ultimate things where you don't need to say them as much anymore. Okay, so the phrase again is, "We might be wrong but we're not confused."

Tomer Cohen (00:03:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:11):
Let's talk about this. So what does this phrase mean and why do you find it so powerful and important to say often?

Tomer Cohen (00:03:17):
Yeah, by the way, it's a simple phrase, but it has in my opinion, so much depth into that and ultimately something I really believe in. It's rooted in clarity and principles that ultimately lead to leadership. And the first time I got the inspiration from it was from a startup founder I met many, many years ago. Their company was on the brink of failure. They had their last attempt and they decided on a path forward and after they decided on a path forward, he was still seeing people hedging in different directions and it led into this confusion in the system where we decided people are still hedging, they're still trying out things they thought could work, and he realized that unless they basically all pull through in the same direction, there is no chance they'll be able to be successful.

(00:04:04):
Now, pulling through in the same direction doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but this gives you a chance of success and that confusion, the system only luck and save you. So that was when he shared that, that was very impactful for me. I think it's a good one for life as well. And for me it comes down to two main parts. One is clarity of thought and clarity of execution, and they're both equally important.

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercell, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS, it's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at WorkOS.com to learn more, that's WorkOS.com.

Tomer Cohen (00:06:46):
On the clarity of thought. What I find people to be attached to, especially when you build an environment with a lot of alpha types is that they get attached to being right or wrong and that really creates a lot of lingering in the system, a lot of confusion and they're still stuck to their ideas. And for me, I get attached to clarity and focus. I think that's much more important. That's why I think when I say I don't mind being wrong, it really comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than necessarily try to hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success. The way we start, we do this in our product gens right now, is we actually spend some significant time on what is the problem we're trying to solve for, but not high level, not like, hey, we want to launch this product, we want to launch a video product.

(00:07:35):
It's exactly what type of video you're trying to launch for which audience, what is your unique criteria, what are you trying, what is very nuanced about what you're trying to solve for? Ideally, once the time you see the problem, you know exactly the problem you're trying, you actually can imagine that mountain. It's not just a mountain, you can see exactly the road, you can see exactly the end of the base camp. But then when you move to solution, I love solutions that are based on first principles. That they have, there's a principle thinking about it, there's opinions about it. If you talk to folks who work with me, they'll tell you, I push a lot for what is actually your opinion, what is your potentially controversial opinion and the best principles have teeth.

(00:08:18):
So saying that we should build a simple product for me is useless. Who doesn't want to build a simple product? But saying that I'm willing to sacrifice or trade off this, that's where I get excited. I'm like, okay, that's a very strong opinion. Let's go into that. Why were you willing to trade off those type of vectors to make it happen? And one thing that I saw also in clarity of thought was this, is I came to the US in 2008, I came from Israel. Our hobby in Israel is to argue. So we argue a lot, it's our love language in many ways. And I come to the US and I notice people say a lot like I don't exactly understand or I'm not exactly clear on this, and it took me a long time to realize they're actually disagreeing.

(00:09:03):
They're just masking it with a layer of misunderstanding and a good mentor of mine said, "Hey, just push back. Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding? If you're misunderstanding, let's spend the night. Let's get to a point where you can articulate my point of view in your words and I can do the same, but if we're disagreeing, let's stop. Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, "Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative." And then I'll say, "But most of your engineers are working on this migration." And they'll say, "Yeah, we have to finish that." I'm like, "So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?" It's like, "Yeah."

(00:10:09):
It's like, but that's exactly what you're doing. You have to make sure that what you're sharing as a priority is actually manifested in your resourcing. Then I'm like, "Hey, this is your top talent. Why is your top talent working on some moonshots that are not in your number one priority?" And they're like, "Yeah." This is where you start finding that really it doesn't really translate into execution as well and you can solve so much by just making that sure that focus is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:36):
So the big lesson here is to push for clarity and push out anything that is unclear, confusion either in thought and also in execution. One of the folks that I talked to that worked with you about this phrase, Josh Redfern, he said that this phrase became really liberating for him, which is really interesting to hear because it forces you to make a call and to be aligned and make sure everyone is on the same page. I guess thoughts on just why this concept is so liberating.

Tomer Cohen (00:11:04):
It goes back to little alpha types or type A folks who are just so attached to not getting it wrong. When you need to move forward and it's not about being right or wrong, it's really about not being confused and making sure everybody's pulling in the same direction. That is actually really liberating. And when you know that the whole idea is to have a Socratic conversation about what you're trying to do, then coming to the table with some kind of half-baked ideas or actually not an opinion, I think actually brings into a conversation of feedback.

(00:11:39):
But you have to manifest it through, if you just play this through but then you potentially playing the right or wrong game, that's really poor. I also think it's the best way to learn. If you don't know exactly what you're doing, how can you learn back from why you made that decision? So if you had a clear understanding, ultimately it's a growing organization. This is not a one-off project. We're going to build many projects in the future. So if you're not sure about what we're trying to accomplish, how can you know what you learned from it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
I love that. So the idea here is make it very okay to be wrong, but make it not okay to be confused and not clear about here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it. Everyone's aligned exactly on the same idea.

Tomer Cohen (00:12:19):
How can I have a product conversation if I'm not sure what you stand for? It's really hard to have a Socratic conversation, really hard to have. If you ask folks how many time you left a meeting in corporate, it could be a startup or larger companies and you are not sure exactly what was the problem discussed or what are next steps. More often than not, they'll raise their hand. That for me is a waste of building time. So actually that agitates me in another great way, but when I come in and I'm proven wrong or there's a strong challenge or argument, again that's a little bit my love language, I actually enjoy those. I think we leave the conversation much better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):
You said there's some other Tomerisms, what are some others just that you can share?

Tomer Cohen (00:13:14):
This is, again, this is classic to building large organizations, but I actually believe in, especially when it comes to products, to really set ambitious goals but then try to over-deliver on them, really set what are you trying to, there's almost like the opposite where people are underplaying it and over delivering, I don't understand what you're trying to do. For me it's like we are here to make an impact. We're here to really set our goals to something really massive. And when I'm trying to visualize this, I see a mountain, you see the peak and the peak exactly how it looks like, you see base camp, you know how to start and maybe the middle of the mountain is kind of blurry, but you'll figure this out. But at least you know the peak you're trying to share, share the peak, share where you're headed to and I think it's just a much more exciting way to build product. It's a much more inspirational way for folks to be part of the product process kind of thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):
I was just chatting with Vlad who worked at Airbnb for many years. He was actually my former manager at Airbnb and he reported to Brian for a long time and we talked about this trait that Brian also is really good at, is just setting crazy high goals. 10 X the goal that you thought you had and what would it take and it worked really well for Airbnb. So I love that you're doubling down on the same idea. Is there an example that comes to mind of one that you, some ambitious goal you set internally at LinkedIn that people are like, "No way," and then it ended up being effective?

Tomer Cohen (00:14:35):
Actually there's a lot, when I think about our LinkedIn feed and thinking about when you started off, it was hard to imagine what that product could be because it was more of a promotional in nature product and I was like, no, is going to be a place where millions of people and not just tens of millions will come daily. And that's insane. That makes no sense based on the numbers today, but I don't start building from the numbers today. I start from [inaudible 00:15:04] I start backwards. I'm like, what this could be, what is the potential here? So how many professionals exist in their role? How many of them would love to find a place to share and engage with content? And this is my starting point. I start from there. So I don't start from the existence to set my ambition. I start from what this could be like based on really inspiration and excitement.

(00:15:30):
Again, it's not detached from reality completely, but it's also not hooked to it. But then Basecamp could be a good start. You're not asking you to make it the next day, but if you don't have that ambition, there's no way you're going to hit that. There's just no way. And there's so many products across LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a 20 plus year old company that many folks did not give it a chance in almost every phase of it. And I think if anything, it's one of those that just keeps getting better and better every year. And part of it is you keep the landmark on. This really has the potential to do so much for so many people. It's really an economic platform. So if you play from that, one billion members, that's actually pretty small where we can actually go,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:17):
I'm so happy you went to this example. This is exactly where I wanted to take the conversation. I was very much in the camp you described of LinkedIn, how could LinkedIn possibly become a place that I want to go and browse a feed and post content? As you probably know, for the longest time it was felt like this cringey place as you said, where everyone comes and promotes themselves, "Hey, I got a promotion or here's my company's new launch." And I think it's so underappreciated the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I use it, I'm a multi-day, multi-Dow user. I check it at least 10 times a day. Most of my traffic to my newsletter comes from LinkedIn, not Twitter where people think, it's absurdly underappreciated and it's I think underappreciated what it took to make this happen.

(00:17:02):
And when I saw you guys starting to try to make it a place people post content, I was like, no way, this is not going to work. Why would people want to share stuff on LinkedIn? And it's working, it's amazing. So I want to spend some time here and just try to go inside the strategy that you guys put together to here's how we're going to make this happen. Come, we've shared, you have this peak of here's what we could become. How did you actually turn this around? What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:17:26):
Yeah, by the way, I'm glad you're finding great audience and traffic on LinkedIn. I think your content, actually, your content is exactly what we're trying to build for, it's expertise, it's advice, it's people you can learn from and it's also the views that really matter, not just the volume that matters. I think if we take a step back, there's so much conversation about zero to one products or scaling products, but you don't have much conversations about minus one to one products, like turnaround products. And I think there's obviously the perception of the market you have to deal with, but people I think in minus to one products, at least from my experience and we had a few at LinkedIn, pages is another one, helping businesses build their presence on LinkedIn. What you find is it's actually, most of the time it's internally harder to do because there's so much entrenched flows and processes and metrics that people are using on that specific area.

(00:18:21):
So you almost have to change the inner workings of the system to make it work. Going back to the analogy of the mountain, if you start from the premise that I deeply believe in is that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Then really almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible and knowledge transaction is one of the most powerful economic transactions you can have. It's the biggest accelerant for an experience and we were always very strong at helping people get a job. We have seven hires per minute, but as we were building more and more knowledge and part of it was we bought LinkedIn, we bought Lynda to make it LinkedIn Learning a while back. Today we had 140 hours of learning every minute on LinkedIn happening across the feed and LinkedIn Learning, it's pretty powerful.

(00:19:13):
And the transformation to the LinkedIn feed was exactly like you said. We actually were the first company to have a social feed, but I think we started wrong. So we started with basically activity feed. So it was like who changed what, who changed the job, who connected to who. It was more of like a tracking your network feed and it became more promotional in nature. So in a way just letting that be just naturally just moved into more of a promotional type of feed. And what we've done is we've shifted dramatically into building, actually this was one of the things I was excited about. So after I was leading the mobile team, there was no feed team, there was no unified feed team, there was no feed PM to an extent, I asked to do this role, nobody cared about it. I really believed in it.

(00:20:07):
I have strong conviction about what I could do there. And I asked to do this role and we assembled the team around it and one of the main things we've done was to really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange. It's about how can I get the right views to the right experts in a way that actually helps them build a reputation and build their business. And then we started from there backwards. So it was basically setting that ground for that mountain peak that was nowhere to be imagined at the beginning and making our way backwards.

(00:20:55):
The first thing we did was really making AI first. So the AI team back then was completely centralized. It was not part of any product team and we brought it together with one unified AI first team. And the belief I had was ultimately the engine of the car was AI and that was almost like de-prioritized or delegated to a team that was not unified in objectives. So bring that in. And then I spent most of my time on objectives and algorithm features and data training, which led me into my passion about training product people to be a first product people. And that was a big transformation there, really shifting and we had incredible AI team, but they were completely, actually, it was a confused operation. They were building something for a whole different purpose and we were trying to aim to that mountain peak and they were putting in a different direction. No bad intent, that's what they were told to do.

(00:21:56):
So bringing it together into this SWAT team was the first thing that actually was extremely powerful, but then became the hard work. You have a product that works in a certain way and you almost want to change its DNA altogether. And it was very hard because whenever we were trying to run experiments that were mass in scale, I told you everybody was relying on the feed for their traffic. It just scared the whole system because numbers were shifting up and down and teams were freaking out about meeting their goals. And then I realized that was just spending my time in escalations instead of actually building a great product. So what I did was I carved out two million members and I said, "Those are my members. I'm going to focus on building that mountain peak. I'm going to build for them."

(00:22:45):
Full liberty and doing whatever, it doesn't hurt numbers, giving the scale and really focus on building a great experience for them. And it wasn't overnight and it wasn't over a week, but over the course of months we've seen dramatic behavior change for those members, almost like secluded, like a country of people that were seeing a different experience of LinkedIn. And once we saw that you actually had strong evidence that wow, if I bring this in, we don't need to spend time talking about how this pie gets slotted between different teams. We can actually grow the pie. The experience just manifests itself in a whole different way and that was a big change internally. It wasn't overnight, but it was really powerful in getting everybody around to see, wow, we have this cohort that is doing extremely well, which was a randomized cohort and then how we can bring it out.

(00:23:39):
I've also done some crazy things. We've done some negative tests to prove some stuff out, test for the sake of learning. When you run something that you can show that if it's just a promotional feed and you played it out organically over time, engage with the tier rates. We ran some really important ad tests as well, but we're really shown separate, almost like we carved out the different product and we showed that this could work and then we brought it out to the main experience for everybody else. And then that was, I would say the inner workings of minus one to one. Then the scanning part really became when we started to focus on professional opportunities. So when people actually share, how do they get the right views into the experience?

(00:24:19):
We don't compete for volume, we're not in the same category of Meta in terms of the skill there, but we will compete all day long for the right people seeing your content. In fact, I think in many ways that's the most powerful part of LinkedIn. How do we make sure that it's professionally productive and safe conversations? How do we trade off bad engagement all day long? In fact, when we started shifting the AI objective from click through into more downstream conversations, spammers actually took notice as well. So they were jumping over the LinkedIn bandwagon, so we had to spend a lot of time removing bad activity from LinkedIn, but that's been the evolution of this process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That is amazing. There's so much I want to dig into here. Okay, so this two million user carve out that you did, basically everyone was just like, what the hell are you doing to our metrics and goals? You're causing all this trouble for the business. Why is this team hurting our metrics? So that was basically a group that those two million users are the only ones that saw this new updated feed and were they removed from everyone else's metrics so they weren't fluctuated as much or was it just?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:26):
They could be kept in the overall because it wasn't as important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
It was a small percent?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
Okay. Got it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
But for us, they were like the world we were basically able to prove with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):
Got it. Okay. That's so smart. Okay, so basically you just decided we're only going to move your metrics a little bit, worst case if we stick to it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:41):
I felt that I tried for a few months to play on the overall experience with everybody, but it was really hard, almost like impossible because you have an organization that is so tied into how things work that I was just hitting walls after walls after escalations and it was just unproductive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:00):
And this is before you were a chief product officer where you could have just said, "We will take this bet. We know this might hurt metrics short-term"?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:07):
Okay, got it. That makes sense. Okay, the other piece, so just like lessons I'm taking away from trying something like this that's an ambitious bet within a company, is put a PM and a team on it with a goal that feels like a core part of the success of just like somebody's ass is on the line to doing this thing.

Tomer Cohen (00:26:23):
Always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Always, with focus on this one problem. And then there's the way you described there's this goal for this feed, but how did you actually try to turn that into a goal or metric or a KPI, what was that in the end, was there something there?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:35):
Yeah, this is an interesting one, one thing we've done actually because the feed is the first thing you land on. I can't just count how many folks engage with the feed because then I'm counting bypassers kind of thing and bystanders that are actually coming into the experience. So we actually started to look at the more, we go a lot into active, engaged and high value engagement. So we go downstream, we kind of put the onus on looking at more downstream engagement there and we build that as the feed engagement. So really trying to show that we're not just counting some overall whatever it is [inaudible 00:27:09] or sessions at the top level. That's not really helpful because any shifts can help there, but really setting targets for that. There's obviously it's a marketplace, so there's the creation side, there's the consumption side's, there's making sure that's healthy and engaging.

(00:27:23):
There was so much we went into that, but I think the best thing was it's almost like you carve out. I think when you do minus one to one, it's really hard unless the CEO says I don't care about how the company performs for the next two years, we're going to go for it. If you want to keep the site keep growing and the experience keep growing, carving out and almost like sending very specific unique metrics but then could easily be extended out once you show it was in retrospect the right way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
And then to give people a glimpse into the way your brain works to identify this is a big opportunity. So you talk about just like I see there's a lever that we're not investing enough in and I see this big opportunity to grow of LinkedIn. How did you decide I need to go and bet on this thing and lead this team and I think feed is a huge opportunity?

Tomer Cohen (00:28:10):
I start from beliefs a lot. So I start from what do I believe this could be or where I actually came to LinkedIn this way. In fact my biggest change in my career was when I moved here and I shifted to more like what do I care about? What am I excited about? What do I have conviction on? I think it's really hard to be a strong product leader without having strong conviction about something. So I start there and in fact coming to LinkedIn as an example, when I came into lead mobile, LinkedIn was a desktop first company, then mobile team was an offshoot of entrepreneurs. I came from a startup that I ran and it wasn't a big, it wasn't, it was like, okay, I want to do mobile, I guess fine. It's like noise at this point. Same with feed. And same when I shifted into ads, I felt really strong about the ability to flip that into a great way for companies to grow.

(00:29:04):
So for me it starts with a conviction of where things could go, what do I believe in? I believe LinkedIn can be an incredible superpower and daily use case for every professional in the world. I believe knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange is the most amazing way to grow your career and to grow your business. So that needs to be a strong pillar of the experience, what didn't exist before and what is better than the feed experience, the home [inaudible 00:29:32] to actually build it. So I don't get attached to what did not work in the past. That's not, I don't know, maybe it's a mistake sometimes, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
How do you actually make time to think like this? A lot of people are listening. They're just like, "Okay, I want to think about what could this become?" Is this just the way brain works? You're always thinking what could this be? Do you set time aside to think quarterly or yearly, what could this be if we really made this amazing?

Tomer Cohen (00:30:02):
It's a good question. I haven't thought about it. It's like a process I do. I don't sit time aside for this, but I'm very reflective. I try to focus, love the conversations on the dream, what ultimately are we trying to achieve? I think LinkedIn has a great process called vision to values that started from our former CEO, Jeff Winner, which is like if you said this is for company or for a product, which is if you're successful, what change would happen in the world? Which I love. It's just a great phrase. It's just a great empowering phrase. So I actually tend to spend a lot of my time there. I'm also very optimistic in nature. Again, sometimes it's probably, I'm not best for any role perspective. You want somebody a bit more pessimistic about the future, but I tend to lead with beliefs versus evidence. I try to prove my beliefs with evidence, but I don't lead with evidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):
Awesome. Okay. And then maybe just one more tactical question about this shift that I wish I could spend hours on because it's so interesting, the success you had making the feed so engaging. Is there anything tactically that would just like wow that would really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post and share interesting content, like a feature or a part of the strategy that really made the feed social?

Tomer Cohen (00:31:21):
I think the lesson would be, for me that was the biggest learning going into AI first that gave me the why is AI so core and why I got to make it a priority all the way to my role today to make sure the rest of the organization thinks AI first. The understanding is is that in a marketplace, if I'm able to satisfy your need on the other side, then it's magic. So ultimately it came down to AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's run separate from the team. And in a marketplace it's all about value exchange. And if I'm able to do value exchange really well, then people will come back and they do and they engage and actually they come back even more and they spend more time. So for me it was that depth into AI first as the engine that moves the whole organization forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):
Got it. So essentially making sure the content you are seeing is the most engaging you could see based on using AI to make the algorithm really smart?

Tomer Cohen (00:32:21):
On both sides. If you are the creator, if you're the person sharing, remember this was a while back, I think it was about the former Olympics and person shared an article on LinkedIn about how they should not call it Olympics, they should call it the commercial Olympics because it's all about commercials and less Olympics. And then they sent me this amazing screenshot about how NBC execs who were covering the Olympics were rearing the post, this first to them was gold. It was like, "Oh my god, my content is influencing, people are seeing it, people that matter." So that was really key. Making sure that when you share something, you share your expertise. The right people on the other side are relevant to your content and they see it. That could make your day or your week or actually it could make your living in many ways. And then on the receiving side, when I come in, it's the things I'm excited about seeing.

(00:33:17):
It's the things that are relevant, the reason your content resonates so much with other people, I can actually take your podcasts and I can apply them at work. What could be a better way to learn? I'll give you another example, which was very, very recent. I met with a known professor in this field and he shared with me how over the last year and a half he started using LinkedIn because somebody told him, "You have a great content, why don't you just post it?" I was like, "I don't want to post on social media." I'm like, "Oh, LinkedIn is different, share on LinkedIn." And he was like, "I post daily. I have so much content over the years, I post daily."

(00:33:51):
And he was like, he basically told me this is unbelievable in terms of economic opportunity I'm getting. He's like, "I'm getting speaking engagements that are roughly half the salary I make in a year here at the university. Just by people seeing this content and getting to the right people. I was invited to advise prime ministers on their investment strategy for the country and I've been teaching for 20 years, but this platform just completely elevated my ability to reach and influence people." That's the magic and that's the value exchange and that's the kind of matchmaking at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):
Amazing. That's an awesome story. This episode is brought to you by Merge, product leaders. Yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration, they're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS, organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product or HRIS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customer's employees. And yes, if you need AI ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.

(00:35:38):
I want to shift a little bit in talking about this AI first mindset that you've touched on a lot. So you talked about how at the beginning of this investment, you've already been focused on AI before it was as hot as it is today, and I've heard from many people that you're really big on getting people to shift to this mindset of being very AI first. Clearly it's worked really well at LinkedIn. I'm curious just what that actually looks like. I know you could be like, "Hey guys, we got to be AI first, AI, AI, AI." But it's different to actually make people really think differently. How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?

Tomer Cohen (00:36:14):
I can spend days on this. This is so important. It's actually so important for me, it's a key focus for me. Actually to your point, long before it became cool to talk about AI in the last two years, and in fact I think I've learned this on myself. So when it comes to the feed, I took the role of the AI product leader, it didn't exist in the company. There was no person that was ever from a product perspective thinking about AI. I think it start with the belief, like we talked about before, I think every technological revolution has dramatically changed the way we build. And AI arguably is the biggest one in our lifetimes. And when I say AI first, it's not about a tech, it's a mindset. It's a start with strategy. It is rare. Maybe now you'll see it, but it was rare two years ago to see anybody in their strategy talk about the role of AI and how they build with AI.

(00:37:02):
Then it goes to the product and then the talent itself you hire, do they actually think this way? The analogy I would give to people is imagine a river rafting boat and you have everybody on the sides holding the pedals and adding accuracy, adding speed, but there's the guide on the back and they're holding those two pedals. Those two pedals navigate pretty much the boat and those pedals are AI and the guide better be you. And in most cases in companies the guide was somebody else, it wasn't the product leader. So then the question is, if AI actually is directing your product or success and it's the biggest factor and you as the product leader is not the one holding those two pedals, what are you doing? And then I realized that it was a bit of a lack of education in that, there was actually most product users used to think of AI as this black box, magic spells that they don't know how it's working so they're delegating.

(00:38:01):
And obviously that's as far from the truth as possible, but there's so many ways to unpack it. When it came to the feed where I push for example, more specifically for the teams, he doesn't stay as an AI first, there's the objective. I would ask him, "What is the objective of the algorithm?" I would challenge you to ask folks more in the folks who are leading products specifically with algorithms inherited built into them, what is the objective of the algorithm and can you write it down for me on a board? They should be able to do so, ultimately it's a mathematical formula and then it's like what features have you added to the algorithm? And this is not user features, this is specifically what parameters to learn on and then what investment do you have in data collections and fine-tuning?

(00:38:49):
Now everybody talks a big game about fine-tuning but again, two years ago, fine-tuning was something that the product folks thought the engineering team was supposed to do. No, it's the whole organization. In fact, you can build a whole strategy just on data collection and fine-tuning and your product will see tremendous success or you can delegate it and it will never happen. So in many ways that was bringing into the fold, in our phase one, which really started around 2016 for me and every team I went to, the AI component was the area I spent most of my time on. I hired people for that. Product leaders, I spent most of my, back to how do I spend my resources, most of my resources there. And it was my top priority all the way from strategy to talent. And ultimately with the last couple of years we've seen this metamorphosis of AI and this incredible new wave and we've done a pretty big change there as well over the last two years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:49):
I love this. So I took some notes on what you're talking about. So the big message that I'm taking away so far is as a product leader, you need to think about things that you thought the engineering leader had to think about or the ML engineer was thinking about things like what is the objective of our algorithm? What are the features that we're building into it? What is the data collection strategy? How are we fine-tuning it? As a PM, you should be asking these questions.

Tomer Cohen (00:40:13):
In fact, you should go all the way to infrastructure. You can have massive lifts in your product outcomes and goals if you probably enhance your infrastructure. How many product people talk about the infrastructure they have? Not many. Influencers, those are things ultimately your goal is to win with your products and build a much more experience to your members and customers. Literally just changing the infrastructure on top of what you build. That could be the biggest lever than you building another button or experience for your members on the top of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):
So say the PMs at LinkedIn, are you encouraging them all to, how is AI integrating into what you're doing? How do you just set this up so that teams do this well within LinkedIn?

Tomer Cohen (00:40:57):
Yeah. So coming into this role in early 2020, we basically established an AI academy. Every PM had to go through training just like we did mobile in 2014, we moved the whole organization to be mobile first, so everybody had to go through this process. I spent a lot of time in my reviews on the AI strategy, the objectives. We make sure there's actually AI practitioners on the product side who are strong, who can teach. So we in waves started to build more of expertise and distinguished leaders across that can actually bring this learning across the board. And then in fall 2022, when we all know what happened, at least a few months after, but we started early, we completely changed our entire almost product operations and portfolio so we can focus on this new wave of AI with LLMs in the front.

(00:41:47):
So LinkedIn has been working with AI very closely since the early days, but mostly as a matchmaker. So it was the matchmaker for our marketplaces. Somebody looks to hire this dream candidate and then you have a candidate looking for the dream job and AI would be the one doing the matchmaking. We talked about the knowledge sharing on the feed. It happens in our commerce platform as well. But AI, I was in the background so I never saw it, it was making those matches. And then with the new level of AI, we actually brought AI from the back of our marketplaces really as the matchmaker to the front. And one of the things we've done there was really asking the teams to completely revisit their entire roadmap.

(00:42:35):
This is fall of 2022, the world will learn about ChatGPT for several in March 2023. So we had a nice beginning there in terms of getting started. And the goal there was let go of what you've built, let go of your roadmap, go back to the drawing board with what are you trying to solve for, back to that idea of clarity on your problem statement and now tell me what's the solution. That's very much AI first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:03):
It reminds me, so one of the folks I pinged about you, Shira Gasarch, she used this quote about you, "Maybe you were made for such a time as this." And it connects to a lot what you're talking about where you've been thinking a lot about. And back then it was called machine learning. It wasn't called AI for a long time and now it's AI. The fact that you've been on this so long is just a perfect synergy for now. It's working its way into everything.

Tomer Cohen (00:43:27):
Here's an example that I think sometimes to bring it to people in a more visceral way if you've been building products, product leaders are used to very much dictate the experience they're building. I want this experience to be exactly like this. I want the member to come from here and this is the options they have and I want them to be able to select this and this will be my default and I want the onboarding to progress this way. And I think this is one of the biggest shifts with this when you become an AI first leader, is that there's a realization that you don't control the experience anymore, you control the ingredients. It's almost like being a chef at the restaurant and you're used to deciding every part of the dish. You're deciding everything from the ambiance to the temperature of the broccoli and then this new technology comes in and say, just give me the ingredients, give me the guidelines of how you cook and now I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it for you.

(00:44:24):
For many folks, this is a very scary feeling, they're not used to letting go of the control. Obviously you build safety guards and responsible AI around it and that's super critical. But at the essence of it, AI is not deterministic. So giving it the rope to learn and do that experience for you ultimately would become much, much better. You have to have that belief going into it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):
Along those lines, I'm curious if there's anything you do to avoid, everyone's like, cool AI into everything and then all these stupid things ship, then no one wants. I saw this hilarious meme of like, oh wait, we built a kind of dumb artificial person. Let's integrate it into everything. Now it's everywhere. Is there anything you've learned about just how not to ship stuff that isn't great?

Tomer Cohen (00:45:11):
I can tell you what we've done here and we've failed a lot, but we learned so much along the way. When we started it in fall 2022, literally started with me calling the leaders coming to the room and we talked about, okay, let go of your roadmaps, like what we've done, great, but I want to let go of the roadmaps and I want to instead go back to what you're trying to solve for and let's meet in a couple of weeks and tell me how you're thinking differently about what you're trying to solve for knowing we have this technology in a role for us. So that was a starting point around just setting out some ground and principles around it. But we didn't start with new objectives to solve. So it wasn't like, "Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?" It was like go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?

(00:46:00):
The second part is we actually allowed teams to run to really inspire creativity. I didn't want to contain them. I wanted to get them really excited about the potential here. And even some things we're building duplicates for a while of similar ideas but done differently because part of it was I was learning. I was very excited to see what people would come up with and see how they can do it. And there was no playbook for building this really, really well. And in many ways we were writing the playbook. Prompt engineering became a playbook internally for us, which every day was amazing. How do you cognitively reverse engineer the brain a little bit? That was incredible. In fact, a lot of things we've learned so much ahead of the market and even shared with OpenAI and shared with Microsoft. But then after that period of just everybody getting excited and building, we basically brought it down and we did top-down got it.

(00:46:53):
So we basically picked back to the objectives we had out of everything that we've seen, those for us look like the best four biggest best we want to want to aim for and we want to converge resourcing across it. So no more everybody's building whatever they want. We also, capacity is also constraint. Cost is a constraint. We want to start bringing them together. So we really much allowed people to, I would say in many words, diverge. But then I would say several weeks after converge, but we had a lot more excitement and understanding about how this thing works and what we can actually do with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):
Love that advice. Basically give people a bunch of time and space to explore and experiment R and D and then as a top-down strategy, pick through this.

# How to achieve hypergrowth in your business and career | Carilu Dietrich (Atlassian)

## Transcript

Carilu Dietrich (00:00:00):
In order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company. The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use, right? I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. 

(00:00:22):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. Hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years, right? They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200. They're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth, because it's going to be here before you know it.

Lenny (00:00:55):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard work, experiences building and growing today's most successful products. 

(00:01:04):
Today my guest is Carilu Dietrich. Carilu is a former CMO and has advised the CEOs and CMOs of hypergrowth B2B companies like Segment, Miro, 1Password, Bill.com, Productboard, Sprout Social, Weights & Biases, and most notably was head of marketing at Atlassian through their IPO. 

(00:01:22):
In today's episode, we cover what hypergrowth companies have in common, how to make big changes to your growth strategy to unlock new channels of growth, why COs don't trust CMOs, and why most CMOs get fired. Also, why most CPOs get fired. Plus, the benefits of waiting a long time to hire your first salesperson, bundling strategy, and a ton of incredibly insightful career advice. A huge thank you to Elena Verna for suggesting Carilu for the podcast. And with that, I bring you Carilu Dietrich after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Rows.com. The world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain.

(00:02:18):
Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools, and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share. If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce, or HubSpot directly into rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read, and embed charts, tables, and calculators into Notion, Confluence, or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rows. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:03:08):
This episode is brought to you by Braintrust, where the world's most innovative companies go to find talent fast so that they can innovate faster.

(00:04:31):
Carilu, welcome to the podcast. 

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:33):
Thanks, Lenny. Happy to be here.

Lenny (00:04:35):
You've had this incredible career. You worked at all these incredible companies. I'd love to just dissect what you have found to be most important and effective in building a career long term, just broadly. And then specifically if you're trying to get to an executive role someday, what have you found to be some more important habits, behaviors, tactics, lessons?

Carilu Dietrich (00:04:55):
I'll start by saying that everyone has their own calculus about the trade-offs they want to make on pursuing their career and the sacrifices they might need to make versus the other things in their life, their family, their hobbies, their passions. And so I think the executive track isn't for everyone because there are a lot of trade-offs.

(00:05:14):
Because I think that some of the most important aspects of getting to the executive suite are working harder, learning more, pushing yourself, taking on more responsibilities and opportunities, maybe even in the white space, that aren't your job or aren't in your regular time. 

(00:05:34):
When I was young in my career, I decided I wanted to be a CMO. And at the job where I had decided I wanted to be the CMO, I worked two hours later than everyone else on the team. And I had this thought in my brain that two hours every day for five years would get me how many more years of experience than someone else? And I could do that when I was young, and I didn't have kids, and I was willing to make those sacrifices. 

(00:05:59):
But you look at a lot of the top CMOs and they have sacrificed a lot of things to read all of the books. And again, if I go back to that first job, I was a PR manager, and we went through a tough phase and we lost a ahead of product right before the major launch of a major product. So I volunteered to moonlight in the product department and run the beta, and do release engineering. And taking on other responsibilities gave me insights into other departments that made me more successful, early in my career and later on.

(00:06:33):
And the same thing happens as you're growing, right? If a department head leaves and you can spend extra time doing your own job and being the interim for this other function, you can really show the top executives that you have the appetite and the skill to take on more responsibility.

(00:06:50):
So I think learning as much as you can about your expertise, working really hard, and taking on more responsibilities, and having a great attitude and a strategic mind are probably what I think helps people get to the C-suite on the personal level. And then I have another set of five things that are what specific ways do you need to train your mind?

Lenny (00:07:15):
I know there's this backlash against working really hard that happened for a while, but I'm on the same boat as you have of success will come from working really hard. And sometimes that sucks, but that's usually how it goes.

Carilu Dietrich (00:07:27):
I think there's ebbs and flows in your life. You're going to have a baby here soon, congratulations. Thank you. And so maybe you take your foot off the gas for a little bit. But really, there's no shortcuts. There's no shortcuts to knowing a lot.

(00:07:43):
One of the people I admire most is Tomasz Tunguz, who was with Redpoint and now started his own VC firm. And I was talking to him about his blog and he was like, "I'd just wake up 5:00 or 6:00 AM every morning and write three to four blogs a week for 10 years." Damn. That is self-discipline and insight and drive. So yeah, no shortcuts. I think. You look at Denise Persson at Snowflake, and she's worked really hard to get there. 

(00:08:12):
So the five things I think you need to do to get to the C-suite that are not personal side are you need to think about how your responsibilities tie to revenue. You need to think and talk in the terms of the CEO and the board. And that can be tricky when you're junior because you don't have exposure to it. But getting a strong handle on finance, and how the finances of the business work, and how the revenue of the business works.

(00:08:38):
I went on a tour of the Tesla factory with my daughter's field trip a couple weeks ago. And the guy who was giving us the tour was like, "So I delivered and stocked all these different parts at the plant and then I would take a list. And after work every night, I'd go to each part of the plant and try to figure out what they were working on and what the challenges and opportunities were. And that's how I moved up."

(00:09:00):
So it's just understanding how the whole thing works together. Because if you want to be in the C-suite, it's a job about how the system works. So I really encourage tours of duty between different departments. I told you about my tour of duty and product. I thought CMOs had to do every function, so I took a tour of duty in every function in marketing, but really getting a sense for other departments.

(00:09:23):
The next thing is the relationships. So building really strong relationships with people by doing good work and helping them. And then the last thing I think is the quality of the companies you work for. So your career and your ability to transcend, which is really moving faster than other people to get bigger jobs, is fairly dependent on the momentum of your company. 

(00:09:49):
So I was a leader at Oracle for five years, and my team grew from five to seven over five years. And I was a leader at Atlassian for four years, and my team grew from 15 to 100. And so if you pick the right company with the right momentum, you have a better chance of getting higher level experiences and accelerated career growth.

(00:10:14):
And then I guess one little footnote. If you pick great companies, great people work for those companies, and go out and work at other companies and also give you opportunities. So I ended up at Atlassian kind of in a stroke of good luck because I had worked for Jay Simons, the president, at two companies before. So the quality of the first company, Plumtree, really helped propel my whole career.

Lenny (00:10:40):
There's so many things I want to double click on there. The last piece, it's the advice I always give people when they're early in their career is to go find a company that's going to do super well. That one experience is going to transform your entire career. Having the logo on your resume, the people you meet, the experience you get financially. But that begs the question, how do you find that? How do you pick a company? I think in your advising today, you join later where it's a little more obvious. "Okay, they're doing great." Do you have any advice or lessons about how to identify earlier where to go work and how to be lucky in that pick?

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:16):
Isn't that the billion-dollar question? So I worked for-

Lenny (00:11:20):
For investing too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:20):
Yeah. I worked at Atlassian, which was phenomenal. Then I worked for Classy, which was a company that helped nonprofits raise money. 

Lenny (00:11:29):
I've used that product.

Carilu Dietrich (00:11:31):
Thank you. And we were acquired by GoFundMe. And it was fine, but it was no Atlassian. And then I spent the next five years trying to figure out, how do you pick your next Atlassian? So my advice would be for people earlier in their careers, it's easy to pick the winners if you go work for a big company that's a winner. I would love to work for Tesla, or AWS. Or right this second, I would die kill for a job at OpenAI. You know some of the big companies that are successful... Salesforce has totally been a career maker to so many top executives.

(00:12:04):
So early in your career, working for big name high momentum companies. I think you can't wimp out. You've got to want it and go for it. And maybe you apply year after year, and you meet people, and you try for it early in your company.

(00:12:19):
Later in your career, I think what you just said, picking later stage versus earlier stage gives you a better view of their momentum. I actually have a Post-it note, got it here, about what I look for. 10 parts of what would evaluate to see-

Lenny (00:12:35):
You just have that Post-it note around?

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:37):
I do. It's one of five Post-it notes on my board.

Lenny (00:12:37):
I want to hear what the rest are too. But keep going.

Carilu Dietrich (00:12:44):
I have to look at it for advisory. I only take eight to 10 clients. I'm always full. And so it has to be a phenomenal company. So how do I know if it's a phenomenal company? Here's my list. Rule of 40, which is your profitability and your costs together. The quality of the investors. Are they really top tier investors? Are they mid tier or some you've never heard of? Investors do a lot of due diligence, but you also want to look at their most recent rounds, because they could have phenomenal early stage and have slowed down. I think the later the size, the more reliable, because they've just made it farther. 

(00:13:23):
Their Net Promoter Score or their customer satisfaction. Do people really rapidly love this product or is it like meh? Their net dollar retention, which is, how fast is their revenue growing? And I should have it on my Post-it note, but Snowflake was the benchmark. I think they were growing at 142%.

Lenny (00:13:44):
I think at one point it was 180, whatever.

Carilu Dietrich (00:13:46):
Yeah. That sounds right. 180, 165. Net dollar retention, if you have a customer and they just renew at the same dollar rate, it would be 100. So 180 is almost doubling just their customers. So they didn't even need new customers, almost doubled their business. A phenomenal net dollar retention means it's a really strong healthy business. 

(00:14:09):
I looked at their growth rate last year, their burn rate, are they going to run out of money? And then ideally, are they number one in their market? Do they have a Forrester or a Gartner Magic Quadrant? People tell you if they're number one. 

(00:14:22):
And then the last thing is I look at their Glassdoor. Is it just a bad place to work and where people unhappy? Because they don't actually survive as long as companies where people are happier.

Lenny (00:14:34):
I love this list. You should turn it into a blog post, and there's another idea for you. Can you share what the other Post-its are around you? Even broadly.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:41):
I can. One says, "More Yoda, less Wonder Woman," which basically is ask better questions. The second one was-

Lenny (00:14:51):
Ask them backwards too.

Carilu Dietrich (00:14:52):
Yeah, right? Ask them backwards. Which is funny, because the other Yoda thing I have up Is... Here wait. "Do or do not. There is no try." Backwards. I have another one that says, "Hell yes or no." When opportunities come to you and you're like, "Should I do this or should I not do this?" You only have so much time in your life. And so if it's not something that really excites you and gives you energy, it's tough to be the best at it. And so hell yes or no.

(00:15:26):
And then the last one is, "Worrying is wasted energy," because I think we live in this economic pressure cooker, and there's a lot of fear and uncertainty. But we just need to take that fear and uncertainty and thank it for giving us urgency. And then make the list of what can we control now and what should we do next.

Lenny (00:15:50):
That's actually a perfect segue to my next question. And by the way, that was amazing. I'm glad that I asked about your Post-its. That's a whole life philosophy right there in Post-its.

Carilu Dietrich (00:15:59):
Yeah, I should do a BeReal. This is what is looks like at this side. These are all the Post-its.

Lenny (00:16:05):
Okay. So the question is around, I don't know if we're technically in a recession, but maybe we're on the verge of recession. The market's not great. And a lot of people are being laid off, or have been laid off, or are worried about being laid off, or just graduating college and looking for jobs. And I'm curious if you have advice for people trying to find a job in this market or just generally trying to accelerate their career. What is your advice for just how to deal with this environment while also trying to advance your career?

Carilu Dietrich (00:16:32):
I'd like to take in two parts. One is if you're unemployed and one is you're in a job. So if you're unemployed, it's tough. It's a tough time. There's a lot of supply. And so I think you just really need endurance and grit. And the sticker worrying is wasted energy, because you will get another job. It's just going to be a little bit more of a bumpy ride than some other years.

(00:16:55):
And the best executives I know have had down periods in their careers, where they were out of work for a while, where they were fired by a CEO, who this or that. And what they have in common is endurance. They're just back in the ring. So I think it's important to not lose endurance. 

(00:17:15):
It's also important not to settle on a crappy job or a crappy company. Each job you have prepares you for the next job, and each logo you have prepares you for the next job.

(00:17:27):
So I'd spent a lot of my career trying to also chase waves. My first job in college, I was in nonprofit, and then I wrote a book on the giving programs of the top 50 tech companies. And I realized that tech companies had a bunch of money in 1999, and were giving it away to charities. And I wanted to go into tech, because that's where the growth and money was. And I thought I could give it back to the world and good, but I could be inside the bubble. 

(00:17:55):
And then within tech, I moved my way to B2B. And within B2B, I moved my way to SaaS. And within SaaS, I've moved my way into dev tools, and collaboration, and now AI. 

(00:18:05):
There's this book called The Millionaire Next Door, which talks about how the very best antique store makes one or 2% profit. And the very worst oil and gas company makes 35% profit. And we know that some of the worst software companies make 65% profit. 

(00:18:25):
So picking your industry will propel your career, and picking the right company will propel your career, and then doing a good job will propel your career. So I think that there's no magic bullet to getting a job. But working your network, sticking with it, and continuing to grow your skills are the three most important things.

Lenny (00:18:43):
Big part of this conclusion is don't feel like your career needs to slow down in this period.

Carilu Dietrich (00:18:49):
And I think if you're in a job, some of my greatest career growth came in the economic downturns. In the 2000s, in the 2008. Because other people take their foot off the gas, and you can put your foot down. If you're willing to learn more, hit yourself into new roles or new responsibilities that no one's covering at your company. When they don't hire tons of people for everything, there's lots of open projects where you can raise your hand and grow. You just can't be as focused on title and salary right now. You're kind of building up value that you'll be able to monetize on the other end of this recession or downturn.

Lenny (00:19:26):
Let's segue to chatting about growth. And I thought it'd be fun to start with your story of running some very expensive ad campaigns. I know the founders are always kind of flirting with this idea of buying a bunch of billboards, running TV ads, maybe subway ads and bus ads. And you've done a lot of that and you've spent a lot of money doing that, and particularly non-digital advertising. And so I'm curious what you've learned from your experience and approach to this sort of marketing spend.

Carilu Dietrich (00:19:53):
Yes. I've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it actually. I ran global awareness advertising for Oracle, and did all of the airports, and the front page of the Wall Street Journal, on the back page of The Economist, and take over in the middle of Salesforce in downtown San Francisco. And we did the Ironman movie sponsorships, and the sports teams and arena sponsorships.

Lenny (00:20:16):
That sounds very expensive.

Carilu Dietrich (00:20:17):
Super expensive. And then Atlassian to a lesser degree, we spent several million dollars on different awareness campaigns to get chat noticed, or to associate Jira with the Atlassian brand. Advertising is sexy and super expensive for the benefits. It's a multi-year benefit of awareness. People have to see things many times, and it has to really resonate with them. 

(00:20:45):
So my advice to founders is that the most important thing is the quality of your product. Oracle spent a ton of money, and people still didn't like us in a lot of ways because they had poor experiences with the salespeople, or they didn't like Larry, or the product had kind of languished since it had been acquired by the company. So your product has to really be fantastic. And then also to do good brand advertising, it has to be sustained over a long period of time.

(00:21:14):
So Oracle had the front page of the Wall Street Journal, back page of The Economist, this boring advertising template with the red bar, but it made it memorable. We would do market tests, and two or three or 10 times more people would recognize the Oracle brand without the logo, because of the consistency versus SAP or or IBM. 

(00:21:35):
So you really need to be thoughtful about spending consistently over a longer period of time, and a smaller amount on a fewer number of things can be really effective. So Snowflake, for instance, has always gotten credit for doing a billboard on 101, and people think they do lots of advertising. But for many years, it was only the billboard on 101. It was just sustained and strategic.

Lenny (00:21:59):
So I guess two things that I take away from that is one, you can spend a lot of money, and if your product's not actually incredible, it's not really going to do much. And correct me if I'm wrong. And then two is sometimes, just one very targeted spend is worth a lot more than just blanketing a bunch of ads.

Carilu Dietrich (00:22:16):
Absolutely. I was telling you a story that at Atlassian, we did a big advertising campaign on our HipChat product, which was head-to-head with Slack, and it was an Office Space spoof with Bill Lumbergh. But the product had some uptime issues, and some feature issues, and Slack pulled ahead, and the advertising wasn't what would've made it or broken the product. It's really the product experience, and the advertising just amplifies.

Lenny (00:22:42):
I think you also shared with me this HipChat ad, that's maybe my favorite billboard ever. And I don't even know why looking back, but it made me laugh so hard. Back in the day, it was this meme of some early meme stick figure guy saying, "Why you no use HipChat?" Looking back I'm like, "Okay. I don't know how funny." But I think in the moment that was a really popular meme, and it really stuck with me.

Carilu Dietrich (00:23:04):
Well if you think about the best advertising, it's something that has a little twist of humor, or personality, or truth that sticks in your brain. So yes, that was a successful advertising. And kudos to my team, because of course I don't write it myself as the head of marketing. But yeah.

(00:23:22):
And some of my other favorite ads are also others that highlight the customer. So New Relic did an advertising campaign around data nerds. When data nerds were not really popular, they were still nerds. And they had these tattoos that said nerd life, and they featured customers on billboards talking about cool data nerds. And some of those campaigns that really stand out have something that's funny, unexpected, and then true to the product.

Lenny (00:23:54):
I remember those, one of the ads featured, our CTO at Airbnb, Mike Curtis, and everyone was very excited to see his face on the Billboards.

Carilu Dietrich (00:24:02):
Yeah, Salesforce has done a great job with those over the years too, really highlighting the customers.

Lenny (00:24:06):
So zooming out a little bit, you specialize working with companies that are going through hypergrowth. And you've worked with companies like Miro, Segment, Bill.com, which I don't know if people know is just a massive, massive business. And also 1Password. 

(00:24:21):
And on the topic of 1Password, interestingly I didn't realize how big and how fast 1Password has been growing. And just last week I saw this report from Okta where they have all this interesting data about which products people are using, and they put out this report showing which products you're getting the most new customers. And then on a different axis, which companies are getting the most users per new customer. 

(00:24:46):
And there's this six companies in this quadrant. Figma, Miro, Snowflake, Sentry, HubSpot, and 1Password, which blew my mind. And interestingly, you work with two of them. And so all that to say, what have you noticed about what is most in common with companies that are going through hypergrowth? What is most in common in terms of what has contributed to them being that successful?

Carilu Dietrich (00:25:08):
The biggest thing is an amazing product that people love to use. I mean ChatGPT is the most hypergrowth product that we've seen in history potentially, because people are so excited to use it and it's working in interesting ways. So Miro, whiteboards were the number one most uploaded asset in Jira forever. Because people all get together and they write their ideas on a whiteboard, and then they need to remember it and iterate on it. And that bringing that concept to life just hit a cord that people wanted to use. And when one person uses it, another person uses it.

(00:25:42):
1Password similarly, I've been a 1Password user for more than 10 years. We used it at Atlassian, as a corporate. And then they have the family plan. So I used it at home and then my dad got elderly, so I had a family that I was the administrator for, and then I go into different companies and you bring it with you.

(00:26:02):
And one of the other companies I advise is Productboard. And I became an advisor of Productboard because 1Password's CPO had it in another company, brought it into 1Password, rolled it out company-wide to get alignment and visibility on the product roadmap. 

(00:26:18):
So in order to get hypergrowth, you have to have organic, inbound, and viral word of mouth. You can't pay enough to grow at those rates and have a viable company, especially in this economic efficiency market. So has to be an amazing product, has to have some viral activity. So we just talked about Miro or Atlassian. You could have an individual person use it and then they say, "Hey, I'm going to present at this meeting with Miro, come join me on my board. I've got these confluence pages we'd set up as a wiki about these engineering topics, and I want your team to collaborate on them." So those natural points where your users are selling to other people is way more efficient than having sales people that have to sell to other people. 

(00:27:12):
And then I think the third thing is really riding the lightning, I would call it. So hypergrowth companies go through the stages of growth that would take other companies five years or 10 years. They're going from 10 to 50, they're going from 50 to 100, they're going from 100 to 200, they're jumping. And so they really need to keep hiring 2X and 3X leaders who have seen the next stage of growth. And then the people inside can be homegrown talent, but it's tricky to keep up. 

(00:27:46):
So my whole business is based on people who are trying to be homegrown leaders, but don't know what the next stage of growth looked like. And so a lot of hypergrowth companies hire ahead, hire advisors. Leaders need to really think about mentors and friendships of people who know what great looks like at the next scale, because it's going to be here before you know it. And so I would say those things. Amazing product, viral movement, and company that can ride the lightning.

Lenny (00:28:15):
I imagine founders listening to this that don't have insane virality or huge word of mouth are like, "Is there no path to being a really successful company?" And then I think about companies that did succeed with other channels, like say paid or SEO. And so I guess the question for you is, do you need to grow in this environment, I guess, primarily through word of mouth, organic reality, growth engines? Or do you still see opportunity for companies to grow other ways, say paid, or SEO, or sales eventually?

Carilu Dietrich (00:28:51):
For sure. All of the things are important. I think what I wanted to say first as you were talking was that it's easy to look at a company after they've been viral and be like, "That's amazing." I would like to start a newsletter. I have. It's carilu.com. Lenny has a newsletter. How can I ever grow like Lenny's virality? But Lenny started with one blog, and then another, and the consistency.

(00:29:14):
And when I look back at Atlassian, people would be like, "It must have been so easy to go from 100 to 500 million." And it never felt easy. It was a slog to do exactly what you're talking about. New features, listen to customers, strong SEO. Actually SEO was the number one marketing motion that we used, and SEM. We spent probably between 15 and 25% of our leads from paid search marketing at the time. Now I have a ton of customers that are pretty deep into account-based marketing.

(00:29:49):
Getting to virality and getting the hypergrowth is not a magic bullet. It's consistency, customer obsession, incremental improvements across all parts of the business. So I think founders just need to double down on having a product that's differentiated and does something that their customers really love. And each incremental step is a step forward.

Lenny (00:30:16):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcast, and to coordinate my sponsors. 

(00:30:35):
More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:30:53):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Plan up today at Coda.io/lenny and get a $1,000 startup credit on your first statement. That's Coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

(00:31:32):
Say that you as a company are seeing word of mouth in some virality, and you want to think about accelerating that, leaning into word of mouth. Obviously you want everyone to be talking about how awesome you are sharing with their friends. Is there anything that you've seen as a good way to lean into word of mouth and accelerate it?

Carilu Dietrich (00:31:49):
I think there's two or three things. One is really empowering the people in your company to be thought leaders. So early days, Atlassian's founders were on all the developer boards. And in fact, I remember, we were maybe 150 million or 200 million, and Scott Farquhar the CEO was still participating and going back and forth in different dev forums when I was like, "I don't know, should we elevate your status? Should we have evangelists and engineers that do this?"

(00:32:18):
And we did, right? And look, one of my clients now is Weights & Biases, the ML ops company helping lots of different AI companies with their ML models. And they have really thoughtful technical people who know more and write more on the blog and engage with their community. And that creates a word of mouth, because they're providing both a product and concepts and learning. That's one of the HubSpot secrets was all of their really thoughtful, helpful content, certifications for marketers.

(00:32:52):
So I think going back to summarize, word of mouth can be driven by thought leadership, which is hiring the right people to really be deeply engaged as super experts. Having a really strong content strategy that's either in communities that already exist, online communities, open source communities.

(00:33:13):
And then third I would say building your own community. So no one sells your product better than your own happy customers. And if I go way back to the very beginning of my career, I worked on a marketing team where I owned demand gen just for net new prospects, and a peer owned demand gen just for existing customer upsell. And we would have different field events.

(00:33:34):
And the existing customer ones were smaller than if we'd invited the prospects and had more buzz. And the prospect ones were very salesy. Whereas if we brought them together and you had customers talking to each other and prospects listening, everyone had a better time.

(00:33:48):
So Atlassian, one of our secrets was this amazing user group community where we just paid for beer and a pizza, and we'd facilitate local in-city leaders, and people would meet up and talk about our products, and talk about development generally, and grow their careers and grow their network. So I think those are the three. The right people, the right content, and the right communities.

Lenny (00:34:11):
As you were talking, I was reminded, I was just chatting with the founder of Gusto about their journey early on. And he said that for the first 200 customers, he sat there with them running payroll, watching how they react every step of the payroll process and how they feel at every moment. And that was a big part of what helped them build the product that people actually continue using, and love, and stick with. And if it wasn't in person, it was on a phone call. And it's like the epitome of doing things don't scale, just like for hundreds of new customers watching them use your product. Pretty wild.

# The $1B Al company training ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini on the path to responsible AGI | Edwin Chen

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You guys hit a billion in revenue in less than four years with around 60 to 70 people. You're completely bootstrapped, haven't raised any VC money. I don't believe anyone has ever done this before.

Edwin Chen (00:00:10):
We basically never wanted to play the Silicon Valley game. I always thought it was ridiculous. I used to work at a bunch of the big tech companies and I always felt that we could fire 90% of the people and we would move faster because the best people wouldn't have all these distractions. So when we start Surge, we wanted to build it completely differently with a super small, super elite team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
You guys are by far the most successful data company out there.

Edwin Chen (00:00:29):
We essentially teach AI models what's good and what's bad. People don't understand what quality even means in this space. They think you could just throw bodies at a problem and get good data, that's completely wrong.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):
To a regular person, it doesn't feel like these models are getting that much smarter constantly.

Edwin Chen (00:00:43):
Over the past year, I've realized that the values that the companies have will shape the model. I was asking Claude to help me drop an email the other day. And after 30 minutes, yeah, I think it really crafted me the perfect email and I sent it. But then I realized that I spent 30 minutes doing something that didn't matter at all. If you could choose the perfect model behavior, which model would you want? Do you want a model that says, "You're absolutely right. There are definitely 20 more ways to improve this email," and it continues for 50 more iterations or do you want a model that's optimizing for your time and productivity and just says, "No. You need to stop. Your email's great. Just send it and move on"?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):
You have this hot take that a lot of these labs are pushing AGI in the wrong direction.

Edwin Chen (00:01:18):
I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, we are optimizing for AI slop instead. But we're optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at a grocery store. We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Edwin Chan, founder and CEO of Surge AI. Edwin is an extraordinary CEO and Surge is an extraordinary company. They're the leading AI data company, powering training at every frontier AI lab. They're also the fastest company to ever hit $1 billion in revenue in just four years after launch with fewer than 100 people and also completely bootstrapped. They've never raised a dollar in VC money, they've also been profitable from day one.

(00:02:05):
As you'll hear in this conversation, Edwin has a very different take on how to build an important company, and how to build AI that is truly good and useful to humanity. I absolutely love this conversation and I learned a ton. I'm really excited for you to hear it.

(00:04:51):
Edwin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Edwin Chen (00:04:55):
Thanks so much for having me. I'm super excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I want to start with just how absurd what you've achieved is. A lot of people and a lot of companies talk about scaling massive businesses with very few people as a result of AI, and you guys have done this in a way that is unprecedented. You guys hit a billion in revenue in less than four years with less than 60, around 60 to 70 people, you're completely bootstrapped, haven't raised any VC money, I don't believe anyone has ever done this before, so you guys are actually achieving the dream of what people are describing will happen with AI. I'm curious just, do you think this will happen more and more as a result of AI? And also just where has AI most helped you find leverage to be able to do this?

Edwin Chen (00:05:40):
Yeah, so we hit over a billion of revenue last year with under 100 people. And I think we're going to see companies with even crazier ratios, like 100 billion per employee in the next few years. AI is just going to get better and better and make things more efficient so that ratio just becomes inevitable.

(00:05:57):
I used to work at a bunch of the big tech companies and I always felt that we could fire 90% of people and we would move faster because the best people wouldn't have all these distractions. And so when we started Surge, we wanted to build it completely differently with a super small, super elite team, and yeah, what's crazy is that we actually succeeded. And so I think two things are colliding.

(00:06:18):
One is that people are realizing that you don't have to build giant organizations in order to win.

(00:06:23):
And two, yeah, all these efficiencies from AI. And they're just going to lead to a really amazing time in company building.

(00:06:29):
The thing I'm excited about is that the types of companies are going to change too. It won't just be that they're smaller, we're going to see fundamentally different companies emerging. If you think about it, fewer employees means less capital. Less capital means you don't need a raise. So instead of companies started by founders who are great at pitching and great at hyping, you'll get founders who are really great at technology and product.

(00:06:51):
And instead of products optimized for revenue and what VCs want to see, you'll get more interesting ones built by these tiny obsessed teams. So people building things they actually care about, real technology and real innovation. So I'm actually really hoping that the slick on [inaudible 00:07:06], it'll go back to being updates for hackers again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:08):
You guys have done a lot of things in a very contrarian way, and one was actually just not being on LinkedIn, posting viral posts, not on Twitter, constantly promoting Surge. I think most people hadn't heard of Surge until just recently, and then you just came out, and like, okay, the fastest growing company at a billion dollars. Why would you do that? I imagine that was very intentional.

Edwin Chen (00:07:27):
We basically never wanted to play the Silicon Valley game. And like I always thought it was ridiculous. What did you dream of doing when you were a kid? Was it building a company from scratch yourself and getting in the weeds of your code and your product every day? Or was it explaining all your decisions to VCs and getting on this giant PR and fundraising hamster wheel? And it definitely made things more difficult for us, because yeah, when you fundraise, you just naturally get part of this kind of Silicon Valley industrial complex where people will, your VCs will tweet about you. You'll get the tech runs outlines, you'll get announced in all of the newspapers because you raised at this massive valuation. And so it made things more difficult us because the only way we were going to succeed was by building a 10 times better product and getting word of mouth from researchers. But I think it also meant that our customers were people who really understood data and really cared about it.

(00:08:21):
I always thought it was really important for us to have early customers who were really aligned with what we were building, and who really cared about having really high quality data, and really understood how that data would make their AI models so much better because they were the ones helping us. They were the ones giving us feedback on what we're producing. And so just having that kind of very close mission alignment with our customers actually helped us early on. So these are people who basically just buying our product because they knew how different it was and because it was helping them rather than because they saw something in that current [inaudible 00:08:52]. So it made things harder for us, but I think in a really good way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:55):
It's such an empowering story to hear this journey for founders that they don't need to be on Twitter all day promoting what they're doing. They don't have to raise money. They can just kind of go heads down and build, so I love so much about the story of Surge. For people that don't know what Surge does, just to give us a quick explanation of what Surge is.

Edwin Chen (00:09:16):
We essentially teach AI models what's good and what's bad. So we train them using human data, and there's a lot of different products that we have, like SFT, RHF, rubrics, verifiers, RL environments, and so on and so on, and then we also measure how well they're progressing. So essentially we're a data company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:36):
What you always talk about is the quality has been the big reason you guys have been so successful, the quality of the data. What does it take to create higher quality data? What do you all do differently? What are people missing?

Edwin Chen (00:09:47):
I think most people don't understand what quality even means in this space. They think you could just throw bodies at a problem and get good data and that's completely wrong. Let me give you an example.

(00:09:59):
So imagine you wanted to train a model to write an eight line poem about the moon. What makes it a good, high-quality poem? If you don't think deeply about quality, you'll be like, "Is this a poem? Does it contain eight lines? Does it contain the word, moon?" You check all of these boxes, and if so, sure. Yeah, you say it's a great problem. But that's completely different from what we want. We are looking for a Nobel Prize-winning poetry. Is this poetry unique? Is it full of subtle imagery? Does it surprise you and target your heart? Does it teach you something about the nature of moonlight? Does it playthrough emotions? And does it make you think? That's what we are thinking about when we think about high quality poem.

(00:10:34):
So it might be like a haiku about moonlight on water. It might use internal rhyme and meter. There are a thousand ways to write a poem about the moon, and in each one, gives you all these different insights into language, and imagery, and human expression, and I think thinking about quality in this way is really hard, it's hard to measure. It's really subjective, and complex, and rich. And it sets a really high bar. And so we have to build all of this technology in order to measure it, like thousands of signals on all of our workers, thousands of signals on every project, every task. We know at the end of the day, if you are good at writing poetry versus good at writing essays versus great at writing technical documentation. And so we have to gather all these signals on what your background is, what your expertise is, and not just that. Like how you're actually performing when you're writing all these things, and we use those signals to inform whether or not you are good [inaudible 00:11:23] for these projects, and whether or not you are improving the models.

(00:11:26):
And it's really hard, and so to build all this technology to measure it, but I think that's exactly what we want AI to do, and so we have these really deep notions about quality that we're always trying to try and achieve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:37):
So what I'm hearing is there's kind of just going much deeper in understanding what quality is within the verticals that you are selling data around. And is this like a person you hire that is incredibly talented at poetry plus evals that they, I guess, help write, that tell them that this is great? What's the mechanics of that?

Edwin Chen (00:11:57):
The way it works is we essentially gather thousands of signals about everything that you're doing when you're working on platform. So we are looking at your keyboard strokes. We are looking how fast you answer things. We are using reviews, we are using code standards, we are using... We're training models ourselves all on the outputs that you create, and then we're seeing whether they improve the model's performance.

(00:12:23):
And so in a very similar way to how Google search, like when Google search is trying to determine what is a good webpage, there's almost two aspects of it. One is you want to remove all of the worst of the worst webpages. So you want to remove all the spam, all the just low quality content, all the pages that don't load, and so it's almost like a content moderation problem. You just want to remove the worst of the worst.

(00:12:44):
But then you also want to discover the best of the best. Okay, like this is the best webpage or just the best person for this job. They are not just somebody who writes the equivalent of high school level poetry. Again, they're not just [inaudible 00:12:57] writing poetry that checks all these boxes, checks all of these explicit instructions, but rather, yeah, they're writing poetry that makes you emotional. And so we have all these signals as well that, again, completely differently from moving the worst of the worst, we are finding the best of the best. And so we have all these signals...

(00:13:12):
Again, just like Google Search uses all these signals that feeds them into their ML algorithms and uses and predicts certain types of things, we do the same with all of our workers and all of our tasks in all of our projects. And so it's almost like a complicated machine learning problem at the end of the day, and that's how it works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):
That is incredibly interesting.

(00:13:31):
I want to ask you about something I've been very curious about over the past couple years. If you look at Claude, it's been so much better at coding and at writing than any other model for so long. And it's really surprising just how long it took other companies to catch up. Considering just how much economic value there is there, just like every AI coding product sat on top of Claude because it was so good Claude code and writing also. What is it that made it so much better? Is it just the quality of the data they trained on or is there something else?

Edwin Chen (00:13:59):
I think there are multiple parts to it. So a big part of it certainly is the data. I think people don't realize that there's almost like this infinite amount of choices that all the frontier labs are deciding between when they're choosing what data goes into their models. It's like, okay, are you purely using human data? Are you gathering the human data in X, Y, Z way? When you are gathering the human data, what exactly are you asking the people who are creating it to create for you?

(00:14:30):
For example, in the coding realm, maybe you care more about front end coding versus back end coding. Maybe when you're doing front end coding, you care a lot about the visual design of the front end applications that you're creating, or maybe you don't care about it so much and you care more about, I don't know, the deficiency of it or the pure correctness over that visual design.

(00:14:47):
And then other questions like, okay, are you carrying [inaudible 00:14:49] how much synthetic data are we throwing into the mix? How much do you care about these 20 different benchmarks?"

(00:14:55):
Some companies, they see these benchmarks and they're like, "Okay, for PR purposes, even though we don't think that these academic benchmarks matter all that much, maybe we just need to optimize for them anyways because our marketing team needs to show certain progress on certain standard evaluations that every other company talks about, and if we don't show good performance here, it's going to be bad for us even if ignoring these academic benchmarks makes us better at the real tasks."

(00:15:21):
Other companies are going to be principled and be like, "Okay, yeah, no, I don't care about marketing. I just care about how my model performs on these real world tasks at the end of the day, and so I'm going to optimize for that instead."

(00:15:31):
And it's almost like there's a trade-off between all of these different things, and there's like a...

(00:15:36):
One of the things I often think about is that there's a... It's almost like there's an art to post training. It's not purely a science. When you are deciding what kind of model you're trying to create and what it's good at, there's this notion of taste and sophistication, like, "Okay, do I think that these..."

(00:15:57):
So going back to the example of how good the model is at visual design. I'm like, "Okay, maybe you have a different notion of visual design than what I do. Maybe you care more about minimalism, and you care more about, I don't know, 3D animations than I do. And maybe this other person prefers things that look a little bit more broke." And there's all these notions of taste sophistication that you have to decide between when you're designing your post training mix, and so that matters as well.

(00:16:21):
So long story short, I think there's all these different factors, and certainly the data is a big part of it, but it's also like what is the objective function that you're trying to optimize your model towards?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That is so interesting. The taste of the person leading this work will inform what data they ask for, what data they feed it. But it's wild it shows the value of great data. Anthropic got so much growth and win from essentially better data.

Edwin Chen (00:16:49):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:50):
And I could see why companies like yours are growing so fast. There's just so much... And that's just one vertical. That's just coding, and then there's probably a similar area for writing. I love that it's... It's interesting that AI, it feels like this artificial computer binary thing, but it's like taste. Human judgment is still such a key factor in these things being successful.

Edwin Chen (00:17:09):
Yep, exactly. Again, going back to the example I said earlier, certain companies, if you ask them what is good poem, they will simply robotically check off all of these instructions on our list.

(00:17:20):
But again, I don't think that makes for good poetry, so certain frontier labs, the ones with more taste in sophistication, they will realize that it doesn't reduce to this six set of checkboxes and they'll consider all of these kind of implicit, very subtle qualities instead, and I think that's what makes them better at this at the end of the day.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):
You mentioned benchmarks. This is something a lot of people worry about is there's all these models that are always... Basically, it feels like every model is better than humans at every STEM field at this point, but to a regular person, it doesn't feel like these models are getting that much smarter constantly. What's your just sense of how much you trust benchmarks and just how correlated those are with actual AI advancements?

Edwin Chen (00:18:00):
Yeah, so I don't trust the benchmarks at all. And I think that's for two reasons. So one is I think a lot of people don't realize, even researchers within the community, they don't realize that the benchmarks themselves are often honestly just wrong. They have wrong answers. They're full of all this kind of messiness and people trust... Long as for the popular ones, people have maybe realized this to some extent, but the vast majority just have all these flaws that people don't realize. So that's one part of it.

(00:18:30):
And the other part of it is these benchmarks at the end of the day, they often have well-defined objective answers that make them very easy for models to hill-climb on in a way that's very different from the messiness and ambiguity of the real world.

(00:18:48):
I think one thing that I often say is that it's kind of crazy that these models can win IMO gold medals, but they still have trouble parsing PDFs. And that's because, yeah, even though IMO gold medals seem hard to the average person, yeah, they are hard at the end of the day. But they have this notion of objectivity that, okay, yeah, parsing a PDF sometimes doesn't have. And so it's easier for the frontier labs to hill-climb on all of these than to solve all these mess ambiguous problems in the real world. So I think there's a lack of direct correlation there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):
It's so interesting the way you described it is hitting these benchmarks is kind of like a marketing piece. When you launch, say Gemini 3 just launched, and it's like, cool. Number one with all these benchmarks. Is that what happens? They just kind of train their models to get good at these very specific things?

Edwin Chen (00:19:31):
Yeah, so there's, again, maybe two parts to this. So one is, sometimes, yeah, these benchmarks, they accidentally leak in certain ways or the frontier labs will tweak the way they evaluate their models on these benchmarks. They'll tweak your system prompt or they'll tweak the number of times they run their model, and so on and so on in a way that games these benchmarks.

(00:19:54):
The other part of it though is it's like by optimizing for the benchmark instead of optimizing for the real world, you will just naturally climb on the benchmark and, yeah, it's basically another form of gaming it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:09):
Knowing that with that in mind, how do you get a sense of if we're heading towards AGI, how do you measure progress?

Edwin Chen (00:20:15):
Yes, so the way we really care about measuring model progress is by running all these human evaluations.

(00:20:21):
So for example, what we do is, yeah, we will take Gore human annotators, and we'll ask them, "Okay, go have a conversational model." And maybe you're having this conversation with the model across all of these different topics. So you are a Nobel Prize winning physicist. So you go have a conversation about pushing different tier of your own research. You are a teacher and you're trying to create lesson plans for your students, so go talk to the model about these things. Or you're a coder and you're working at one of these big tech companies, and you have these problems every day, so go talk to the model and see how much it helps you.

(00:20:57):
And because or searchers or annotators, they are experts at the top of their fields, and they are not just giving your responses, they're actually working through the responses deeply themselves, they are... Yeah, they're going to evaluate the code that it write. They're going to double check the physics equations that it writes. They're going to evaluate the models in a very deep way, so they're going to pay attention to accuracy and instruction following, all these things that casual users don't when you suddenly get a popup on your ChatGPT response asking you to compare these two different responses. People like that, they're not evaluating models deeply, they're just vibing and picking whatever response looks flashiest or [inaudible 00:21:38] are looking closely at responses and evaluating them for all of these different dimensions, and so I think that's a much better approach than these benchmarks or these random outline AV tests.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):
Again, I love just how central humans continue to be in all this work that we're not totally done yet. Is there going to be a point where we don't need these people anymore, that AI is so smart that, "Okay, we're good. We got everything out of your heads"?

Edwin Chen (00:22:00):
Yeah, I think that will not happen until we've reached AGI. It's almost like by definition, if we haven't reached AGI yet, then there's more for the models to learn from, and so, yeah, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):
Okay, cool. So more reason to stress about AGI. "We don't need these folks anymore."

(00:22:18):
I can't not ask just... People that work closely with this stuff, I'm always just curious. What's your AGI timelines? How far do you think we are from this? Do you think we're in like a couple years or is it like decades?

Edwin Chen (00:22:28):
So I'm certainly on the longer time horizon front. I think people don't realize that there's a big difference between moving from 80% performance to 90% performance to 99% performance to 99.9% performance, and so on, and so on. And so in my head, I probably bet that within the next one or two years, yeah, the models are going to automate 80% of the average LL6 software engineer's job. It's going to take another few years to move to 90%, and another fewer to 99%, and so on, and so on. So I think we're closer to a decade or decades away than [inaudible 00:23:03].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):
You have this hot take that a lot of these labs are kind of pushing AGI in the wrong direction and this is based on your work at Twitter, and Google, and Facebook. Can you just talk about that?

Edwin Chen (00:23:14):
I'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, all these big grand questions, we are optimizing for AI slop instead. We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth. And I think this relates to what we're talking about regarding these benchmarks. So let me give you a couple examples.

(00:23:35):
So right now, the industry is played by these terrible databoards like LLM Arena. It's this popular online leaderboard where random people from around the world vote on which AI response is better. But the thing is, like I was saying earlier, they're not carefully reading or fact-checking. They're skimming these responses for two seconds and picking whatever looks flashiest.

(00:23:53):
So a model can hallucinate everything. It can completely hallucinate. But it will look impressive because it has crazy emojis, and boating, and markdown headers, and all these superficial things that don't matter at all, but it catch your attention. And these LLM-reading users love it. It's literally optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at the grocery store. We've seen this [inaudible 00:24:15] data ourselves. The easiest way to climb LLM Arena, it's adding crazy boating. It's doubling the number of emojis. It's tripling the length of your model responses, even if your model starts hallucinating and getting the answer completely wrong.

(00:24:26):
And the problem is, again, because all of these frontier labs, they kind of have to pay attention to PR because their sales team, when they're trying to sell to all these enterprise customers, those enterprise customers will say, "Oh, well, but your model's only number five on LLM Arena, so why should I buy it?" They have to, in some sense, pay attention to these leaderboards, and so what their researchers [inaudible 00:24:47] tell us is like they'll say, "The only way I'm going to get promoted at the end of the year is if I climb this leaderboard, even though I know that climbing it is probably going to make my model worse and accuracy [inaudible 00:24:57] following." So I think there's all these negative incentives that are pushing work in the wrong direction.

(00:25:03):
I'm also worried about this trend towards optimizing AI for engagement. I used to work on social media. And every time we optimize for engagement, terrible things happened. You'd get clickbait and pictures of bikinis and bigfoot and horrifying skin diseases just filling your feeds. And I think I worry that the same thing's happening with AI. If you think about all the sycophancy issues with ChatGPT, "Oh, you're absolutely right. What an amazing question," the easiest way to hook users is to tell them how amazing they are. And so these models, they constantly tell you you're a genius. They'll feed into your delusions and conspiracy theories. They'll pull you down these rabbit holes because Silicon Valley loves maximizing time spent and just increasing the number of conversations you're having with it. And so yeah, companies are spending all the time hacking these leaderboards and benchmarks, and the scores are going up, but I think it actually masks up the models with the best scores, they are often the worst or just have all these fundamental failures. So I think I'm really worried that all of these negative ascendants are pushing AGI into the wrong direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):
So what I'm hearing is AGI is being slowed down by these, basically the wrong objective function, these labs paying attention to the wrong basically benchmarks and evals.

Edwin Chen (00:26:11):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
I know you probably can't play favorites since you work with all the labs. Is there anyone doing better at this and maybe kind of realizing this is the wrong direction?

Edwin Chen (00:26:21):
I would say I've always been very impressed by Anthropic. I think Anthropic takes a very principled view about what they do and don't care about and how they want their models to behave in a way that feels a lot more principle to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:38):
Interesting.

(00:26:39):
Are there any other big mistakes you think labs are making just that are kind of slowing things down or heading in the wrong direction? Where we've heard just chasing benchmarks, this engagement focus, is there anything else you're seeing of just like, "Okay, we got to work on this because it'll speed everything up"?

Edwin Chen (00:26:55):
I think there is a question of what products they're building and whether those products themselves are something that kind of help or hurt humanity. I think a lot about Sora and...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:07):
I was thinking that's what you're imagining.

Edwin Chen (00:27:10):
Yeah, what it entails, and so it's kind of interesting. It's like which companies would build Sora and which wouldn't?

(00:27:17):
And I think that answer to that... Well, I don't know if answer is myself. I have an idea in my head, but I think the answer to that question maybe reveals certain things about what kinds of AI models those companies want to build and what direction and what future they want to achieve, yeah, so I think about that a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:37):
The steel man argument there is, it's like fun, people want it, it'll help them generate revenue to grow this thing and build better models, it'll train data in an interesting way, it's also just really fun.

Edwin Chen (00:27:51):
Yeah. I think it's almost like, do you care about how you get there? And in the same way, so I made this tabloid analogy earlier, but would you sell tabloids in order to fund, I don't know, some other newspaper?

(00:28:09):
Sure, like in some sense, if you don't care about the path, then you'll just do whatever it takes, but it's possible that it has negative consequences in of itself that will harm the long-term direction of what you're trying to achieve, and maybe it'll distract you from all the more important things, so yeah, I think that the path you take matters a lot as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:33):
Along these lines, you talked a bunch about this of just Silicon Valley and kind of the downsides of raising a lot of money being in the echo chamber. What do you call it, the Silicon Valley machine? You talk about how it's hard to build important companies in this way and that you might actually be much more successful if you're not going down the VC path. Can you just talk about what you've seen in that experience and your advice essentially to founders, because they're always hearing? Raise money from fancy VCs, move to Silicon Valley, what's kind of the countertake?

Edwin Chen (00:29:02):
Yes. So I've always really hated a lot of the Silicon Valley mantras. The standard playbook is to get product market fit by pivoting every two weeks. And to chase growth and chase engagement with all of these dark patterns and to blitz scale by hiring as fast as possible. And I've always disagreed.

(00:29:20):
So yeah, I would say don't pivot. Don't put scale. Don't hire that Stanford grad who simply wants to add a hot company to your resume, just build the one thing only you could build, a thing that wouldn't exist without the insight and expertise that only you have.

(00:29:32):
And you see these buy to [inaudible 00:29:34] companies everywhere now. Some founder who was doing crypto in 2020, and then pivoted to NFTs in 2022, and now they're an AI company. There's no consistency, there's no mission, they're just chasing valuations. And I've always hated this because Silicon Valley loves to score on Wall Street for focusing on money. But honestly, most of the Silicon Valley's chasing the same thing. And so we stayed focused on our mission from day one, pushing that frontier of high quality complex data, and I've always loved that because I think startups...

(00:30:03):
I have this very romantic notion of startups. Startups are supposed to be a way of taking big risks to build something that you really believe in. But if you're constantly pivoting, you're not taking any risks. You're just trying to make a quick buck. And if you fail because the market isn't ready yet, I actually think that's way better. At least you took a swing at something deep, and novel, and hard instead of pivoting into another LLM wrapper company. So yeah, I think the only way you build something that matters that's going to change the world is if you find a big idea you believe in and you say no to everything else.

(00:30:30):
So you don't keep on pivoting when it gets hard, you don't hire a team of 10 product managers because that's what every other cookie cutter startup does, you just keep building that one company that wouldn't exist without you. And I think there are a lot of people in Silicon Valley now who are sick of all the grift, who want to work on big things that matter with people who actually care, and I'm hoping that that would be the future of how we go with technology.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
I'm actually working on a post right now with Terrence Rohan, this VC that I really like to work with, and we interviewed five people who picked really successful generational companies early and joined them as really early employees. They joined OpenAI before anyone thought it was awesome, Stripe before anyone knew was awesome, and so we're looking for patterns of how people find these generational companies before anyone else, and it aligns exactly what you described, which is ambition. They have a wild ambition with what they want to achieve. They're not, as you said, just kind of looking around for product market fit no matter what ends up being, and so I love that what you described very much aligns with what we're seeing there.

Edwin Chen (00:31:33):
Yeah, I absolutely think that you have to have huge ambitions, and you have to have a huge belief in your idea that's going to change the world, and you have to be willing to double down and keep on doing whatever it takes to make it happen.

# What it takes to become a top 1% PM | Ian McAllister (Uber, Amazon, Airbnb)

## Transcript

Ian McAllister (00:00:00):
If you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion, or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light.

Lenny (00:00:22):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Ian McAllister. Ian is the author of one of the most classic posts on product management, What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM, amongst many other pieces of writing that he shared online. Ian has managed over 100 product managers in his career. He spent 12 years at Amazon where he built Amazon Smile and led the team responsible for growing Alexa internationally. He also worked at Airbnb with me and now he's at Uber leading global product for the vehicles platform, which includes making Uber's fleet increasingly electric and autonomous. In our conversation, we focus primarily on two topics. What separates a top 1% PM from everyone else, specifically for new PMs and also for senior PMs. And we also dig deep into the working backwards process. We get into how you can implement the process on your team and how you might be doing it wrong. There's also a bunch of links to templates and guides in the show notes, so if you want to follow along, definitely check those out. With that, I bring you Ian McAllister.

This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Lex Friedman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies and internal testing that they do.

Lenny (00:03:13):
And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. To take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:03:55):
Ian, welcome to the podcast.

Ian McAllister (00:03:57):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. I've been looking forward to this.

Lenny (00:03:59):
Me too. I'm sure you hear this a lot, but when I was a new product manager, a very new PM, the post that you wrote on what makes a top 1% product manager was really influential and really helped me figure out what to focus on and what skills are really important. And I find that it continues to live on as this very legendary post for product managers who are trying to figure out what to do. And I just reread it in prep for this post and I was just like, wow, this is ... Now that I'm on the other side, I'm like, this is so right. And so I'm really excited to dig into a lot of these things in person, virtually in person, and with you. So thank you again for doing this.

Ian McAllister (00:04:35):
Yeah. Man, it's awesome. I'm excited just to spend some time talking with you about product and we'll see what happens.

Lenny (00:04:42):
Did you expect the impact that this post had when you were writing it, when you were just putting this together, the impact that the post had in your career or just the PM industry?

Ian McAllister (00:04:51):
Definitely not. I used to lurk on Quora at the time and then I was just having fun reading things and answering some questions and I used to look for questions in the Goldilocks zone. They weren't too high level of abstract like how do you be a good problem, but they weren't too super specific and this one was kind of right in the middle. And so I'd pluck off a couple of those and I think more as a way to structure my own thoughts, that was what was interesting and fun for me to do that. Not because I thought it'd have any kind of real reach. But obviously it's been cool to see that people reference it pretty often and that's been pretty fun.

Lenny (00:05:23):
We'll link to this in the show notes. If folks that are listening don't know what we're talking about, we'll link to it and you can check it all out. And we're going to be talking about a lot of this stuff in the actual chat, but there's a couple things there that are worth maybe drilling in on a little bit. One is just the impact that writing on the internet can have on someone's career. This one post I imagine had a lot of impact on the trajectory of your career. Is there something you could share there? Is that true?

Ian McAllister (00:05:45):
Yeah, it did. And there's another post, I think it was before this one, someone just asked about Amazon's product development process and so I wrote about the working backwards process. Which isn't my process. I just used it and just described it and just kind of caught on a little bit there as well. I think those two, and then I started to write more about people management and product management. And I think the value for me was so awesome just to make connections with people in the industry and it felt like this is, I guess, the 2010 or something like this where a lot of Amazon people I of thought were just so 100% heads down. It was a little bit of a secretive culture, not maybe like Apple, but it was pretty private. But I was interested in the startup community and product in general and so I think I spent a little time trying to engage with folks and I just made so many great connections and relationships from this.

Ian McAllister (00:06:39):
I remember interacting with you and getting to know Joebot and other folks at Airbnb early on even before I joined. But obviously I'd credit this work and those relationships for me ultimately going there and so many great relationships and people I've met because of it. And aside from just the little positive feedback, I mean people tweet at me periodically, be like, "Hey, by the way, just love this post," and whatever. And so it's super gratifying.

Lenny (00:07:03):
You mentioned a little bit about your background and we're about to get into that and I want you to share all the things you've done. But the other piece there that I think is interesting that comes up again and again in the power of writing is it often just starts with you trying to collect your thoughts and putting it out there and ends up, wow, so many people find that valuable and it spreads. And so that's just a really simple way of thinking about if you're starting to write online, just summarize something that you've been thinking about that you want to just crystallize in your own head. There's this quote that's probably falsely attributed to Mark Twain and Hemingway often of just like, I don't know what I've thought until I've written it down. And that's super true with these things and so that's a good example of this.

Ian McAllister (00:07:42):
And I think with any kind of writing, it was probably less structured initially, but I would, partially because I was trying to share something for an external audience, try to just organize it and make it compact and not too wordy or rambling. And I think business writing, I spent a lot of that time doing that at Amazon, is so valuable because you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator. And so there's two tests in writing well or communicating well. It's both those things. So I found it's pretty valuable in kind of sharpening your ax.

Lenny (00:08:15):
So these are the two things we're going to focus our chat on is what makes a top 1% product manager and then the Amazon way of working and especially working backwards. So these are all good cues for where we're going. But before we get there, can you just spend just a minute giving us a sense of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're up to now?

Ian McAllister (00:08:31):
Well, I can tell you what I have done. I'll let others decide what's wonderful or not. So after doing finance and economics in school, I made the logical choice and I got a job doing marketing in the beer industry and then the next logical choice, I moved to Tokyo and I bootstrapped my way into software development without knowing Japanese or software development. Did that for a few years, came back to the states working as a developer at a startup and then kind of a midsize company and then moved to Microsoft as a program manager, pretty much a product manager. The same thing there in that role. Learned some good stuff and then made a connection with Amazon and moved there 2006. And that was really the start of when I think about building my product toolbox and leadership toolbox. So few different things I did over 12 years, a few years in retail and conversion.

Ian McAllister (00:09:22):
I then moved in traffic and direct traffic loyalty when I created Amazon Smile. The role in Alexa. I led Alexa International, so scaling Alexa and Echo to six more countries. And the last role in delivery experience and operations. So I led a number of different programs there and then recently joined Uber where I'm a senior director of product and tech for vehicles. So that means everything, all the tools that help fleets and rental companies make their vehicles accessible to Uber drivers so they can earn. Sustainability tech and electrification, our vehicle platform, and then creating a path for autonomous vehicles to come onto the platform. And that's it.

Lenny (00:10:03):
Amazing. I just realized this one thread through your career is autonomy and AI a little bit, right? With Alexa and then with Uber, with these autonomous cars stuff you're working on now. Is that something realized or is that an accident?

Ian McAllister (00:10:18):
Well, I mean I guess you could connect those things. Obviously both are machine learning, AI. The way I think about it is that I've done a whole bunch of different lifetimes, especially around eCommerce, and so it allows me to cover the gamut. Plus, I guess I forgot to mention the time at Airbnb working with Joebot and you and Vlad and Dan and Shirley and there was focused on building out the customer support technology platform. So that's another part of the eCommerce platform. Covers the gamut.

Lenny (00:10:45):
I forgot to bring that up too. I'm glad you touched on that.

Ian McAllister (00:10:48):
I don't know how I missed that. I guess I skipped past that with the Amazon stuff.

Lenny (00:10:50):
The most transformative time getting to work together.

Ian McAllister (00:10:53):
That was awesome. That was awesome. I learned a lot from you too during that time.

Lenny (00:10:56):
What a time. This is a good time to chat about, speaking of Airbnb and all that, to chat about what makes a top 1% product manager. So I know your post was really titled what separates a 1% PM from a 10% PM, but it feels like it's even broader, just like how do you become a top 1% product manager. And I thought maybe a good way to start here is maybe just run through the attributes that you've found over the years or here's the things that a top 1% PM needs to get great at. Maybe just run through them and then we'll talk through them in a little more detail.

Ian McAllister (00:11:28):
Yeah, I was going to pull up my post here so I could actually refer to it. Do you want me to go through all of them or just pick out a couple to touch on?

Lenny (00:11:33):
Let's maybe just go through them quickly just to put them out there and then I'll have some follow up questions to dig into a few of them.

Ian McAllister (00:11:40):
All right, sounds good. Well, the way I listed it at the time, think big. Always want to hunt for bigger impact. Communicate, I think we'll probably touch on that a little bit. It's super important for PMs as a test of their thinking and their communication. Simplify. How you can do more with less and have more impact. Simplifying is a great way to do that. Prioritize. That's I think the core skill after communication of a PM and there's so many different lenses to view that. Let's see here. Forecasting and measuring. I think that it's really important. What separates product managers from consultants sometimes is you forecast and then you execute and then you measure and validate and that helps you build your instincts. Just obviously the core execution of just shipping and doing what you said you do. Understanding technical trade offs is that you don't have to be a software engineer to be a great PM, but the more you learn about technical trade offs, not just product and customer trade offs, that will help you simplify and get more yield out of your resources.

Ian McAllister (00:12:40):
Understanding good design. If you're working on anything customer focused, that's always going to help you think in the mind of a customer or user. You don't need to design, but the more you understand helps. Writing effective copy. This goes a long way not to get close and not to sub out the copy to somebody else, but to get good at communicating with a couple words to your customers. That's a great skill. Those were the ones that I wrote at the time, I guess 10 years ago, and then I refreshed the post recently in my newsletter. And I added a couple new ones honestly, because as I reflected back, there was a few that I think a lot about these days that I missed the first time around. Earn trust with others. That's so important as a PM, but especially if you're going to grow as a product leader becomes even more important.

Ian McAllister (00:13:29):
And I think trust is the currency of a product manager and a product leader, especially if you're going to grow in your career. Digging for data. It's out there and you got to develop the tools to go find it. Not to depend on your analyst or what's in the reports today. So that's a really important skill for anyone in product. And probably the more junior you are, the more important it is as you're really in the weeds there building product. Pushing back effectively. This is an art and a skill, but I think your ability to do this is pretty correlated with your ability to grow and succeed as a leader. Because if you say yes to everything, you're going to go nowhere. Adapting to change. How you react to change will obviously impact one, your mood and your morale, as well as how effectively you can rally yourself, your team. And then driven by impact, not promotion. Ultimately that's what you want to wake up every day thinking about how to have an impact for your business and that will be an indicator on your likelihood of promotion. So do that instead of just focusing on how to get promoted and having that guide your day.

Lenny (00:14:33):
Awesome. So it's a long list. There's a lot that a PM needs to be good at, which I think if you're a PM you already know. It's a wild, crazy, impossible job to have everything nailed down. And at the end of this post even mention you've never met a 1% PM that does all these things. And I think that's important. No one's going to be the best at all these things. And so just to drill down a little bit and get a little more focused. Say you're a new product manager. Of these, I forget how many there, maybe 10, 12, what are the top three that you think new PMs should get most good at and focus on?

Ian McAllister (00:15:06):
Probably communicate, prioritize, and execute. I think those are just the core building blocks. Other ones will be more important as you grow and become more senior, but those ones, no matter where you are in your product career I think are super important. Being a better communicator is something I've been working on my entire product career and I'll be working on until the day I stop. And I remember years ago I was at Microsoft, my first effectively product manager role and my product unit manager, Thomas, came by the office and I think he asked me, "When is this going to ship?" And I was like, "Well, this thing is taking a little bit longer here and this other thing and yada yada." And I gave a bunch of background, but I didn't really answer the question. And I got a little feedback from him like, that's not really the ... Ultimately he's waiting for a date.

Ian McAllister (00:15:53):
And so I just reflected on that and that was, as I remember, my journey to try to be a better communicator over time and I'm still on it. When I went to Amazon, I worked for Kim Rackmiller who was our, I think at the time, SVP for Worldwide Discovery. And I think she was Amazon's first TPM. And she was tough but super smart. And so that was also an early experience to learn from her. And sometimes you get some feedback when you didn't really answer the question. And my first boss, Russell and I organized and started to gather this thing called the Book of Kim. And so we would gather these best practices that we learned from her elsewhere. Avoid weasel words, answer first and then explain, own your problems. And started building this.

Ian McAllister (00:16:36):
And then I extended that over time and added a bunch more and wrote a post called the Operators Manual. I tried to gather all these things together. But it's such an important thing and the stakes get higher as you work with more and more senior people. But if you can get in the habit early of answering a when question with a date, knowing how to use numbers to answer questions and honestly just learning from feedback and grade yourself after you get feedback on a doc or after a meeting or after answering a question in an elevator. And if you try to say, "Gosh, how could I have done that better?," and then try to get better, you can. And you can go far if you just focus on that and all the other 150 skills of a product manager, but if you don't have that, it's unlikely that you're going to really go too far in your product career.

Ian McAllister (00:17:24):
So that was communicate. I guess prioritize as the next one. And so I think this is the number one key tool of a product manager is prioritization. Because so many things come from being good at prioritizing. And it's not just what project do you do next or do you do this project or that project. There's so many different dimensions to prioritization. There's which themes are you going to prioritize in a roadmap and which projects within a theme and how are you going to sequence those projects, how much of a project you're going to build. And also just time management is also a prioritization function. Like what are you going to choose to spend your time on? Which things are you going to really go all out to make great and which things are you going to starve for attention or just not do? Given the same amount of skill intelligence and resources, a product manager with a great innate ability to prioritize is going to generate 5X the impact of someone without that skill.

Ian McAllister (00:18:18):
My early, if you could call it success at Amazon, I think was completely dependent. It wasn't because I worked smarter or I was smarter, I worked longer hours or I was more technical than other people. I think it was just because I was one, super hungry for impact. And if there was a number or a metric that measured success at the business I was running, I wanted that to go up and to the right. Not to hit a goal, but just to go as far and as fast up to the right as possible. And if anything, it was just working with a team to hone in on the projects that would do that with the greatest leverage and just marshaling all the team's resources. So that was a good start. That was a fit with Amazon in terms of working backwards from a fitness function or a metric.

Ian McAllister (00:19:01):
And so did that with the first team I was there and then again later managed the gifting business. And so it just was one skill that I think helped me as well as make up for maybe some deficiencies I'd had. I don't have the biggest brain in the world and I don't have the biggest working memory and I wasn't the most technical, but by trying to really get good at that prioritization, I think that's helped me and it still does.

Ian McAllister (00:19:23):
I think execute is the third one, which is no surprise that every PM has to execute. And I think assuming you prioritize well then execution means sort of molding what you want to build into a simple compact package that has the highest impact possible. And then also execution's a big function of the team you're working with. So it's your designers and your data science folks, and especially your engineers.

Ian McAllister (00:19:47):
So anything to do with how well they're doing their jobs or how well they're resourced or whether they're getting better and better at every sprint, you have some amount of ownership in helping make that happen because that directly impacts your team's ability to execute and ultimately your reputation as well for being able to execute. The drive that goes into execution, product managers are the mode of power behind execution and impact. And if you stall out or you don't do your job, the project's probably going to stall out as well. And so you're the ones, especially with a TPM, if you're lucky enough to have one in the back of the ship, kind of beating the drum and driving everyone forward. But again, lots of people have written a lot of stuff about execution and there's a lot to it, but I think those are probably the three I'd focus on.

Lenny (00:20:32):
Awesome. And what's interesting about these three is if you look at the rest of the list, think big, understand technical trade offs, understand good design, I think what I would take away from this is those are the things you don't need to focus on that much when you're a new PM. Focus on, as you said, communication, prioritizing, executing. Focus less on these other things because later they'll become more and more important and obviously learn as much as you can, but it's almost bit easier to think about the things you don't need to stress about when you're starting out.

Ian McAllister (00:21:02):
Yeah, I think that makes sense. If there's a core or think about in year one as a PM, focusing on those things. And you can develop other skills over time. But yeah, I think you're spot on there.

Lenny (00:21:14):
If we were to go back through these three, just maybe as a last question, and you may not have an answer to this, but if you think about communicating, prioritizing, and executing, is there one tactical thing you could suggest that a PM listening to this can do to get better at one of these things? Is there a trick you've learned of, wow, this is one way you could level up communicating, executing, prioritizing or not?

Ian McAllister (00:21:37):
The closest thing to a checklist, the post I mentioned, the Operator's Manual, that was the closest thing to, if you do these things, these specific actions, I think it'll go a long way. Because a lot of them are guided around not doing the easy pitfalls and communication mistakes like rambling. If you're asked a question and you explain and then maybe you get to the answer, if you just think, answer and then explain or sometimes answer and then shut up, that actually is a tactical thing you can do to get better at communicating. And there's some other tips in there as well. So that was my attempt to try to encode, to take some of the ones that we gathered early at Amazon, add some more. The others are ... Yeah. There's no just simple trick unfortunately to prioritize other than ... I mean I think working backwards is a good technique to have impact to guide your prioritization. And that is something where it's not a simple tip, but there's a set of practices and behaviors that you can do that will ultimately lead you to prioritize better.

Lenny (00:22:39):
Awesome. We'll talk about all that.

Ian McAllister (00:22:40):
And then I think communication, the simple tip was just grade yourself after you communicate and try to just take a moment and after a while you'll just do it naturally to think about, "Gosh, how would I have answered that question better?" And so the next time you could try to answer that question better and it's just a continuous improvement process.

Lenny (00:22:58):
Or maybe even ask your manager, "Hey, what could I have done better in terms of how I communicated in that last meeting or that last email?"

Ian McAllister (00:23:04):
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (00:23:06):
Okay, so then coming at it from the other direction, say you're a senior PM, what are three of these attributes that you would suggest folks focus on to get better and level up in their career?

Ian McAllister (00:23:17):
Gosh, it's still communicate, to be honest. I think that's the one at every level of product, just the stakes are higher. I think think big is one for sure. There was a phrase I think Warren Buffett in the Berkshire Hathaway letter used at some point. Was at our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants. And so I think at any scale as a PM, whatever your idea is or whatever your solution or the problem you're solving, take a minute at the beginning to say, could this be bigger? Could this be a bigger thing and more impactful than the initial idea, even if the initial idea sounds big? So that's a tool and that's often where I'd start when my PMs were sharing an idea is I'd try to expand it to the degree it might be expanded, think about it from that perspective and then maybe you want to still start small, but with a bigger vision in mind.

Ian McAllister (00:24:04):
Earn trust is a huge one and that's kind of why I added it more recently. And it becomes even more important as you get into senior roles because I think it's truly the currency of a product leader or probably any leader in any function. Because if you want to ask for more resources to do something bigger, if your leadership doesn't trust you to use those resources well or do what you said you're going to do, you're probably not going to get them. But if you've built trust that you're a good steward of resources and you make a lot of impact with a given team, that's directly going to correlate with your ability to gain more resources. Trust is just built by repeatedly setting and meeting expectations. And I think that's a good mantra to think about as a FM. Am I meeting the expectations that I set? And not just doing good things, but calling your shots, forecasting, setting a goal, and then hitting it.

Ian McAllister (00:24:54):
And if you do that repeatedly, you're going to be in pretty good shape. And there's so many practices as a product manager or product leader that build trust. You tell the truth without fail. And you launch when you say you'd launch and you launch what you said you'd launch and you own your mistakes. And then the other practices just lose trust. If you lie or if you're evasive, if you don't ship what you said you're going to do, if you ignore your mistakes or you repeat them. And so I think just simply having high standards for yourself and think of trust as that currency, that's going to correlate well as a PM, as a GPM or director of product in any level, that's the thing that you want to build.

Lenny (00:25:34):
So thinking big, building trust. Was there a third?

Ian McAllister (00:25:37):
I think maybe the last one, which is certainly relevant for a PM but is really true as well, is driven by impact. And if you forget about everything else, forget about politics, forget about promotion or having a bigger org or whatever, if you simply wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can, or if you're a leader trying to use your team to have the biggest impact you can in the company, which will influence how you build your roadmap and how you do every part of your day, that's a really good guiding light. And I remember in my first 10 years at Amazon, just naturally not because I thought about it, I was just hungry to have an impact. Take my business, grow it as fast as possible. I wasn't maybe loosely thinking about promotion, but I wasn't thinking about it. I never talked to my manager about it and I wasn't bringing it up. I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger. And then the net result was I was promoted several times and I did grow in my role, but that wasn't what drove me. It was just the impact.

Lenny (00:26:38):
Would you say that driving impact is more important for a new PM or senior PM? It feels like impact is the soup within which all PMs swim and that's constantly important, but it's interesting that you mostly put that into the latter part of a career. Do you feel like with new PMs on your team you're less expecting them to think about impact and focus on impact?

Ian McAllister (00:27:01):
Well, I mean I think for junior PMs, if you're a brand new PM, then yeah, you want to have an impact, but you're really just ... You have a project or a feature to ship or something like that and you're often not necessarily given a lot of latitude to build your own roadmap. But you're asked to ship this. So you want to spec it, you want to execute and do it. But increasingly as you grow, there are opportunities to sense out and try to have a bigger impact maybe and then start to influence prioritization or roadmaps. It's just that the expectations, it goes from being a nice to have as a junior or first time PM to as you get a little more senior, hopefully if things work the way they should work, that's really how you're evaluated. Yes, you want to treat your team well and you want to do a whole bunch of other things, but take two people, one has a massive impact on the business and one who doesn't, then the right way to work should be that first person should be the one that grows and develops and is tasked and with bigger challenges just because if you're impactful at a bigger challenge, that's even more important for the business. So I think that's a good way to think about the flywheel of product leadership.

Lenny (00:28:11):
It feels like a lot of times you get lucky as a new PM. You work on a project that ends up having a lot of impact that you didn't necessarily drive. You just happen to work on something that, wow, this was a huge deal and that feels like an important thing to optimize for a little in your early career is work on something that's likely to have a lot of impact even if you're not responsible for setting the strategy and prioritizing.

Ian McAllister (00:28:29):
Well, I think that's true if you have a choice in where you work in product. If you have a choice to work on something that's part of offense, something that drives the business. And it's true that executives wake up if something drives dollars or customers or offense things and it just maybe shouldn't be this way, but a little less interested in things that maybe less than a risk that just the risk never happens, it comes to pass or a cost center that operates a little more efficiently. So that it's one lens where that might relate to your success. I think also who you work for. And I think most of us don't get to choose that especially early in our career. It either works out in your favor and which is great and that was the case for me, especially at Amazon, some of the leaders I worked with. But sometimes it doesn't. But I think the more that you can suss out who you work for because then the better they are at these skills and prioritizing, one, they're just going to be a better teacher and a better role model to learn from. So I think that's an important thing to think about in any kind of job change.

Lenny (00:29:30):
To close the loop on this piece for more senior PMs, the skills to focus on, you said, thinking big, building trust and driving impact. I'll put you on the spot. I'll give you two options, two directions to go with this. One is if you want to get better at each of these three things, do you have any one thing someone could do or what does great look like for thinking big or building trust or driving impact? Those are two options.

Ian McAllister (00:29:58):
That was six questions there Lenny. Let me see here what I'm answering. Well, I think the think big one is interesting and one way to think about thinking big, especially as you grow in your career is most people operate within a box. There's a box of there's product management and these are the things that product managers do. And you basically build a roadmap and you prioritize features and you work with eng. And so that might be the typical kind of product scope and tech. Most of my roles were ones where I was kind of a GM but a really product focused GM and so I naturally found myself taking a much wider view of what product is across disciplines. And I was lucky enough that I had engineering teams and marketers and analysts and other folks and so that helped me. But I think as a PM you can still do that, even if those functions don't report to you, is take that really wide view of what success for your product is and not have the blinders on its product or tech.

Ian McAllister (00:30:58):
It's anything. It's anything that influences the success and your customers' success or anything else. And it just means, you don't own marketing or you don't own this other function, but you own it until you find somebody else to own it. And so that's not necessarily thinking big in terms of scale or whatever, but in terms of how you think about your role as a PM and what your ownership responsibility is. And so I think just the more that you ... You don't want to get over your skis as a PM and then you're trying to change your CFO's mind about something necessarily. But the more you grow, that you have to increasingly do that and find the constraints or barriers to your success or your product success and knock them down no matter what they are.

Lenny (00:31:43):
Yeah. It makes me think about just the advice of think like an owner, think beyond just your one little bubble, think about the broader business outside of the one little product you might be working on. So that's great advice.

Lenny (00:33:08):
Before we move on to the working backwards piece, which I'm excited to get into, is there anything else you want to share on this thread?

Ian McAllister (00:33:15):
I might just talk about earn trust because this is one that I didn't put in there initially and I honestly don't think that I recognized the importance of it early on in my career or even in the middle of my career and it's been in the last couple years that I really understood the importance of it. My wife Sarah is a product manager in AWS and so as I've mentored her a little bit in her career and I've seen how this is really a superpower for her, it really made me reflect like, what are the things I could have done better in different roles to earn trust more? And it's not just the basic things like to be honest and tell two different people the same thing versus different things. I think it's trying to really understand, work backwards from that person and what are their goals and what are their organization's goals and honestly spend the time and the energy to try to get to alignment in the same place.

Ian McAllister (00:34:09):
And be willing, not just bullheaded, which I might have been earlier in my career, maybe still to many people, but charging forth what do I think's right but taking some more time to try to forge an alliance with someone because if you do that you're ultimately going to be more successful. So that was just one that I was probably slow to recognize the importance of and I'm trying to catch up now.

Lenny (00:34:30):
Is there a story that comes to mind where you look back and I should have earned trust there or I broke some trust here that you'd be willing to share?

Ian McAllister (00:34:39):
When I was working with you and the team at Airbnb, I think this is one where Joebot brought me on to help build out the customer support technology platform maybe more how Amazon would do it. To maintain a high level of quality but to become more efficient as well and to reduce the cost so that Airbnb wouldn't have to scale customer support this to the same degree the business was scaling. And so trying to build a new team and develop and I was pretty heads down doing it the way I thought it should be done and working with the team there in terms of let's get a strong analytics framework. Let's measure all these things and really understand what's going on at the data level and then let's use the same prioritization muscles that had made me successful at Amazon to prioritize things that were best worked backwards.

Ian McAllister (00:35:26):
And I think that what I didn't do as much as I should have is obviously really partnering with the customer support leadership team as well. That was something where I think in some ways it felt like we were in alignment and getting on stage together and stuff, but it turned out I maybe hadn't spent as much time and effort on that as I thought to build that true support there such that that leader would rally the organization around it as well and we'd be marching in the same beat. And so that was something that I would reflect. Now, I think the team did amazing things and Shirley really carrying the torch there in the entire team and so accomplished a lot. But that was a learning about ... Going back, I probably would've spent more time and really tried to do even more on that.

Lenny (00:36:12):
Thanks for sharing that. I never knew that story. And it sounds like the takeaway there is maybe don't take for granted the leadership team, the team that'll actually be using the product. Is that a roughly way to think about it?

Ian McAllister (00:36:23):
Well I would say that if you have a certain approach you may be believe it's the right one and it may be the right one, but if you don't build the support and the relationships that they're going to help carry that out and execute on that strategy, it may not get executed as well as you think it should be. And so that's an important part of success. It's a risk that you have to mitigate. And trying to earn trust and to do it that way is a way to mitigate that risk that the right product and the right direction and the right strategy, it may not land if you don't have that support that you need. And so that I think was my learning.

Lenny (00:37:00):
What better way to learn a lesson than get some wrong and then you never forget it again.

Ian McAllister (00:37:06):
You could call it getting wrong. Just think of something I could have done better. And just that same continuous improvement mindset. It's to everything, every role, every experience, every project, every communication. And if you build that muscle to try to do it better the next time and also just the try to be a little self aware about what could have gone better, then I think it's a really good muscle to build.

Lenny (00:37:27):
This is a good segue to the second area of where our chat is going to go, which is Amazon and things you've learned about just the working backwards process. How many years did you say you worked at Amazon total?

Ian McAllister (00:37:38):
12 years.

Lenny (00:37:39):
12 years. It feels like everyone that worked at Amazon is 10 years or more. It's these large numbers. So they must be doing something right and I don't know. What do you think that is actually? Why do people stay there so long? It's amazing.

Ian McAllister (00:37:52):
What's interesting about Amazon, and it's changed over time, is that I think pretty quickly whether you're a fit for it or not. And it can be kind of a crucible and a little spartan. And it just clicked with me though because I'm kind of a structured thinker and right brain. And so this idea that hey, I could have this business and then figure out one metric or fitness function that determines success and then my job is to make that number go up and to the right. That kind of fit with me. And then I rewired my brain probably over the first 10 years around this concept and I just felt like I was learning, I was not only working with smart people that were driven, which was true at Microsoft as well, but there was kind of this DNA in the organization and this wiring that I thought was really effective and it just kind of clicked with me.

Ian McAllister (00:38:44):
And so I molded myself to the environment and at every step of the way I felt like I was learning and growing and one of the benefits for me is you get a chance to learn from so many other people in these different settings. You get the chance to read documents that make you learn more so than probably a slide deck. You get a chance to be in weekly business reviews with really smart people and learn from that. Not just learn from your own experience but from everyone else in that room. So I was just a sponge and so much learning happening that I think propelled my career. And so that was why, especially the first 10 years, that it was so fantastic of just growing and feeling yourself build these new muscles and develop these new tools and I loved it. So that was why I stayed so long and obviously Airbnb then, it was the time to try something new, which was a great experience and kind of a test. I was in Seattle and the company was in San Francisco and spending three days on a road each week was a good learning and ultimately a reason to come back and be Seattle based. But then I chose Amazon again because it was still a great place and I thought I could continue to learn.

Lenny (00:39:52):
Awesome. I was going to mention they drew you back in. So yeah, that's pretty rare. What did you learn from folks like Jeff Bezos and Jeff Wilke about building product leadership, company building? What's stuck with you working with folks like?

Ian McAllister (00:40:04):
I would say two very different people but complimented themselves so well. I didn't have hundreds of meetings with Jeff Bezos while I was there, but I did have a chance, especially in the development of Amazon Smile and then early when I started the social team to have some of those meetings where I wrote the doc and it was Jeff and 10 other people reviewing. The process of doing, even before hitting on Amazon Smile, it was really kind of a innovation process I guess you could call it, where we had a goal in mind to increase customers' loyalty to Amazon, their direct traffic loyalty, not in the way Prime did, which is a paid program, but to try to come up with another program or way in which customers might start their shopping on Amazon instead of elsewhere. And so I was running the gifting business. I moved over to the traffic org to try to come up with a new program with no team or anything.

Ian McAllister (00:40:58):
And then I would meet with Jeff Bezos and Wilke and others every couple months and I would profile a couple different options and use the working backwards process and we'd review some facts. And so there was a bunch of learnings throughout that process. One, I found Jeff to be super encouraging. And each time we'd leave one of those meetings, we maybe didn't find the thing in that meeting. We'd talk about it and brainstorm a little bit, but he would always leave and be encouraging and with a quote. One time he was like, "Remember, this process doesn't have to be efficient because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going." And then he'd leave the room and whatever. So I found the rhetoric around Jeff or blowing up or whatever, I didn't find any of that and I found him to be super encouraging and he found all these times to help train me in the working backwards process.

Ian McAllister (00:41:52):
There was a time when I came with a press release for a concept and it didn't have a problem paragraph. I'd skipped that. And he reviewed it and so forth and he was like, "You know what, maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem." And so it was kind of a little lesson to me like, "Yeah, maybe that is why I did it. I wasn't really working backwards, I kind of had the solution in mind and so I'd skipped over that part." So that was one just very specific learning about the process from Jeff. So Jeff Wilke, I probably learned more from Wilke just because I had more exposure over my time there. At one point he was my skip level. And I have such tremendous respect for Wilke or Jaw as he was called internally because he was sort of the consummate operator.

Ian McAllister (00:42:34):
This muscle that I think you learn working at Amazon about being an operator, whether you're ... You're not in operations, but any part of the business that I think came from him. And I think it was due to him that Amazon developed that muscle. And I think it's one way that separates some Amazon PMs from people who haven't worked there in that environment and that continuous improvement mindset. That's so important. And one of the forums that was a great learning was the WBR or Weekly Business Review. Or later called Consumer Business Review. So this was a forum where Jeff would lead the meeting. It would be a series of metrics for different parts of the business. Everywhere from fulfillment to customer support, to traffic to category teams to programs. And I would present on Amazon Smile there. And the way he would run that meeting and enable you to get through a metrics meeting for the entire North American retail business in one hour.

Ian McAllister (00:43:27):
And the way he ran that meeting would lead all those leaders to build these muscles because you wanted to be prepared to speak to the variances or trends in your business in a key metric and know your business and know what you were doing based on that thing. And so just this hour a week of probing and asking questions and everyone ... There might be a hundred people in that room prepared to answer questions about your business. And it had this cascading effect that not only was I or the leaders there on the spot having to answer a question and being prepared, but then I would do the same thing with my team, et cetera. And so I was trying to build those muscles in my team such that they could bring their insights and understanding and actions on things in this cascading effect. So that was a mechanism, which is another really big thing at Amazon that led to all these amazing behaviors.

Ian McAllister (00:44:17):
And I think a lot of those mechanisms came from Jeff Wilke or he created an environment where they would be developed throughout the organization and then propagated. And so that was one thing, just that operational mindset and rigor that being a product leader is not just about building new things, it's about how well you run what you've already built. And if you're really paying attention to the product that you operate, it will give you ideas for things you could do to double down on something that's happening well or to prevent something bad happening. And I think that's been a very key reason for Amazon's scale. Another thing I really respect about Jeff Wilke, and I think Doug Harrington has some of this as well, is the notion of a little bit of tough love. And I think that's important and that neither were assholes, but sometimes, and especially Wilke, you need to get that look kind of like your dad might look over his glasses at you and be like, "Hey."

Ian McAllister (00:45:15):
And so I think that was kind of the vibe that you would get. It was professional, it was respectful, but sometimes everyone needs a little kick in the ass and I think that was something, but it almost builds more respect from him and just incredible leaderly behavior, which I really respect and I try to model and I try to do the same because I respected it so much. And then I guess the last attribute of Wilke, which I really saw was teaching. And it wasn't just saying this is the right thing or this is what my decision is in a meeting, but teaching the why and the pattern, the mental model that informs him to think this is the right thing. And so I think he was just great at teaching, taking a moment. It might just take 10 seconds in a meeting to teach.

Ian McAllister (00:46:01):
And that's something that I've forgotten at different parts of my career, especially as you get more experienced and you know the right decision to do and you know what you want, whatever, that may be the right thing, but I think you'll have a lot more lasting effect if you could abstract it to a degree and teach the lesson. Because then that person will hopefully learn the lesson and can apply it to a bunch of future situations and also understand the why more. And it helps them sometimes disagree and commit more so than just being given prescriptive advice.

Lenny (00:46:33):
Sounds like it must have been an incredible experience learning from these two. Thanks for sharing all that. I want to get to the working backwards stuff. I feel like we've talked about this a lot. We've talked about this on other podcasts with other guests. I feel like people understand the general idea. Yeah, Amazon works backwards. They write a PR. Maybe there's a six pager thing they do. But I feel like there's not a lot of, here's how actually do this thing. And so just to spend a little time on this, when you see teams trying to work backwards and be like, "Let's work backwards. We're going to be like Amazon.", what do you find they do wrong when they're actually trying to implement this idea of working backwards? What's the most common mistake do you find?

Ian McAllister (00:47:11):
Well, working backwards is all about the problem and starting there and obsessing about the problem and being guided by it to then go into the solution. So when teams that do it wrong is they don't do that. They don't work backwards. They have something they want to build. These things look similar. These two technologies or whatever. We could combine them and then do this. And if you say we could and it's not grounded in a customer or customer's problem, you're not working backwards. And then you may use "the working backwards process", but you already have the solution. And so you're adding the problem after the solution. You're retrofitting the problem, retrofitting the customer. And so that I think is the number one thing is that they don't get the importance of truly starting with the problem that you're trying to solve and being faithful to that working backwards from the problem.

Ian McAllister (00:48:03):
When I first started at Amazon and community, we had this business of automated merchandising using community content, and that was the core thing we were doing is to grow that. But there was this Jeff idea that a team was super excited about. Because I think in some meeting he'd kind of sketched it out or whatever. And so that there was already all this momentum to build this thing that was actually a Jeff project, but I should have known at the time, in hindsight I do, because the name they had for this project was ASIN to ASIN linking. And ASIN was the identifier for a product on Amazon. And so it was kind of this not working backwards idea ultimately of if you could link to products by a subjected attributes and then you could build a feature around it that allowed customers to vote on these things and then it would be kind of ...

Ian McAllister (00:48:50):
So in spirit, it really wasn't working backwards. But the team was all excited and so we eventually wrote the press release and we did it. And it turned out, it wasn't successful. We ended up shutting it down later. And so I learned a lot, this was the first year or two at Amazon, about using the working backwards process but not really working backwards. And so that's literally, if I'm reviewing a working backwards press release or fact, or even talking with someone about a new initiative, my brain is wired now to not be able to process any information until I focus on the problem and the customer. And then once we start talking about that, then I can engage and literally work backwards to say, okay, how do we solve that problem? And what's the most elegant way to solve it? Or if there's three problems, what's number one or two or three? So it's probably a gap in me that I can't process information without working backwards from the problem, but I find it to be helpful when people do that.

Lenny (00:49:47):
So when people talk about working backwards, the way you're describing it is interesting where it's focused on start with the problem, which I think generally product teams try to do. Their one pagers their PRDs often have, here's the problem we're solving, here's why it's a problem, here's how we think about ... Is that the core of working backwards? I always imagined it was the launch release and the PR thing and maybe the FAQ. Working backwards at Uber and other and Airbnb, do you actually do that for every project yourself at this point?

Ian McAllister (00:50:17):
There's two parts of it. One, there's the concept of working backwards from what you're trying to accomplish. And I still absolutely do that with my teams as well. What are we trying to accomplish for the business or accomplish for a customer and let's start there. And if they have a problem that is interfering with their ability to be profitable for their ability, if it's a business customer or it's a customer trying to accomplish a goal, starting with that problem. That's different from the working backwards mechanism, which is the press release and the FAQ, which was the mechanism that Amazon used to enforce working backwards, which I think is effective. And I've tried to teach that and write some posts about with templates and things like that because it's a great way to start of the press release has a paragraph about the problem. That's what you write.

Ian McAllister (00:51:00):
And then you write the solution paragraph and then the customer quote. And then the fact which is is there a legitimate plan to succeed? So if you don't have that muscle to work backwards already and your team, it's a great thing to try, but that's not the only mechanism that can do it. And eventually if you do it enough and you build that muscle to work backwards, you can do it in any number of formats, whether it's something in a PRD or some other way. But the key is that you don't think what we could build, you think about the problem and then the solution that solves that problem.

Lenny (00:51:35):
Got it. Okay. So the press release is not core to it. It's like a trick to get you to think about the problem you're solving. It's not how you plant announce it.

Ian McAllister (00:51:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:51:43):
Interesting. I never thought about it that way. So when you're doing this process at other places outside Amazon, say you're a product leader that's trying to ... I want to improve the way we think about product. What is it that you suggest they do specifically? Is it write out, here's the problem we're solving? Is there more to it? What would you suggest there?

Ian McAllister (00:52:02):
If it's a blank slate, truly, you could certainly use the working backwards process like Amazon does with the internal press release and then the fact and so forth. So that's fine. But a lot of companies have a different way they go about it. Some companies are very much, it's slide culture and presentations and so forth. And so as a product leader you could think about what you do with your team and what you do upwards or across. And so you may have the latitude to use any process with your team. And I've done that at some companies where using documents and if they're supportive of the team and they recognize the value of that, like, oh actually this is good and this is a great way to write things down on paper and to have better information content and richer discussion that oftentimes I think people will find that versus a slide with a couple bullets is not great. Then you can build that muscle.

Ian McAllister (00:52:54):
And I've found it's a great way to teach and use those to dive deeper into product. But depending on the organization you're at, that may not wash to train your senior leadership to use the process you want to use. And so then it might be a matter of finding the opportunities to try something and saying, "Are you open to doing something this way?" A review of a doc instead of a review of a whatever. So that's a little separate than just working backwards, but I think you just have to acknowledge the environment you're in. And also, unless the organization has a specific format to do this. If it does, you probably just need to use it. Different leaders process information, different ways. You may find one format's effective with your leader, but another one to educate a broader organization. But it's very company specific. So despite what I might want to do, I've just got to recognize that I have more leverage down with my team versus up or across.

# Making time for what matters | Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky (Authors of Make Time, Character VC)

## Transcript

Jake Knapp (00:00:00):
It's not really about productivity, it's not about time management. It's really just about, look, at any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not. The notion with the highlight is imagine it's the end of the day if someone asks you, "What was the highlight of your day," what would you say? That's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that, and you still feel really good about your days. You still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.

Lenny (00:00:37):
Today, I've got two guests, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. Jake and John are authors of two incredible books, Sprint and Make Time. With Sprint, they've helped more than 300 teams design new products and bring them to market, including teams at YouTube, Slack, Gusto and One Medical. Previously, John and Jake worked at Google Ventures, and before that, at Google, where John was a leader on Google Ads and YouTube. And Jake helped build Gmail and co-founded Google Meet. Today, they run a venture capital firm called Character, and they actually just opened up applications for their accelerator program called Character Labs, which you can learn more about at character.vc/labs.

(00:01:16):
In our conversation, we focus on their more recent book, Make Time, which a guest of this podcast, Ben Williams, recommended in the lightning round, and I absolutely loved and wanted to make sure more people learned about it and the advice within it, especially product leaders and founders who are constantly looking for ways to be more productive. I want to get you right to the meat of the conversation. So, let me just say that we get into a ton of very practical pieces of advice for how you can be more productive in your day, and if you listen to this episode, I guarantee you'll find at least three things that you'll want to start doing differently starting tomorrow. With that, I bring you Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:57):
Let me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers. Sidebar is a private, highly- vetted leadership program, where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback.

(00:02:38):
Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today?

Jake and John, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jake Knapp (00:04:17):
Thanks for having us. We're so stoked to be here.

Lenny (00:04:20):
I was just re-listening to the audiobook of Make Time to prep for this conversation. And I feel like I kind of know you guys from listening to your voice for so long in the car, and it's a little surreal to be talking to you guys.

John Zeratsky (00:04:31):
That was really fun to record. And while we were doing it, we kept saying to each other, it was like we were recording the world's longest podcast.

Jake Knapp (00:04:39):
That's what it felt like.

Lenny (00:04:41):
Actually, on that, how long does it take to record audiobook? I've always been curious. How much time does that-

Jake Knapp (00:04:45):
Well, it takes twice as long as it should have because my stomach kept growling and the microphone would pick it up. And so, John would do a perfect take and we're both sitting in the little room together and the engineer was in the other room and he'd be like, "You got to do it again. You got to do it again. The guy's stomach keeps growling."

John Zeratsky (00:05:07):
I think it took two days, right?

Jake Knapp (00:05:09):
Yeah, I think it was two days. Yeah, and I think actually they thought it would take two days, so I don't think my stomach slowed us down too much.

Lenny (00:05:16):
That is not as long as I thought. I thought it was a month of recording and such a painful experience. Sounds like not so bad.

John Zeratsky (00:05:21):
No, honestly, it was really fun. I mean it's weird, but it's just like, I don't know, you can get into this very intense zone where you're singularly focused, right? There's nothing else that you need to do or should do, so it's just like read, drink tea, read, break for lunch, read, drink tea. It's just like this really satisfying flow.

Lenny (00:05:45):
That sounds like a great few days.

Jake Knapp (00:05:47):
Yeah, I think it was really fun doing it together too. I think it would've been harder to do... I mean obviously people do it and I think they like doing it on their own, but we've been working together for so long, it's always more enjoyable when we get to do something together. So, that made it cool.

Lenny (00:06:02):
Amazing. I want to do an audiobook now. That sounds like a lot of fun. So, to start diving into our conversation, so you guys wrote this very seminal book called Sprint, which we're going to talk about. But you also wrote this other book that I have right here called Make Time, that to me was even more powerful and I think it might be even more powerful in people's lives than Sprint. And I think it's one of the most interesting and most fun productivity books out there. My wife actually grabbed the book from my desk the past week as I've been prepping for this, and just started highlighting it. You could see all these highlights in here. She just goes-

John Zeratsky (00:06:36):
Awesome.

Jake Knapp (00:06:37):
Oh, that's so cool.

Lenny (00:06:38):
[inaudible 00:06:38] I want to be more productive. Also, a guest on the podcast introduced me to the book. At the end of the podcast, I'll ask you this too, but I ask people, what book do they recommend most to other people? And he mentioned this book, and so that's how I uncovered it. So, it all comes full circle.

Jake Knapp (00:06:49):
That's so cool.

Lenny (00:06:50):
So, I thought we'd start with Make Time and then get to Sprint in the second half of the conversation. First question is just what do most people get wrong when they're trying to become more productive?

Jake Knapp (00:07:01):
To set the answer up, I'll give you a super brief history of Make Time. And for over a decade, John and I have been, in quotes, designing time as part of our work with startups, helping them find or expand product market fit. So, we developed a design sprint at Google Ventures, which the Sprint book is about. And now, we run this venture fund of our own called Character. And we run these highly-structured sprints with companies. And when we're doing that, we get to control how everything happens. We get to change the defaults of the way the workday happens, of what happens sort of hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute, how people are using technology, how people are interacting with each other. All those things are sort of under our control because we're trying to achieve these big goals in a really short period of time. Everybody focused.

(00:07:53):
So, as this stuff was going on, John and I started applying some of the lessons, the things that we found were working really well in those structured sprints. We started experimenting with applying those in our own day-to-day lives, and we found that some of those things were super effective and they were a bit counter to the way we'd sort of heard or learned about productivity. And there's all kinds of habit books and productivity hacks out there. And I think John and I have probably tried most of them, if not all of them. But it seems like 99% of the people who follow those things are still feeling overwhelmed, they're still stressed out all the time anyway.

(00:08:33):
So, even though we are not productivity gurus, this hasn't been like this thing we were doing forever, it's not our full-time job, but we thought we want to share this framework. So, Make Time, the book and the blog that proceeded it was just kind this side project to share what we learned. And yeah, it seems like it is resonated with a bunch of people. There's this kind of steady stream of interest in looking at these things a different way.

Lenny (00:09:00):
I love it. I love that it emerged out of the sprint concept. I know you talked about the book, but I forgot that and these are all very related. I also love that a lot of the best stuff comes from people actually doing the thing. This came from, "I just have discovered all these little things and I'm just going to share it." Not just like, "I need to write a productivity book."

John Zeratsky (00:09:16):
Yeah, I think, like Jake said, we both had always sort of been dissatisfied with the state of the productivity art, and we had big things we wanted to do. I mean, when you work in any kind of job, I mean we've both spent our early careers as designers and the job is really all about doing big projects. It's all about being able to focus, being able to spend time on the things that matter. And that's to say nothing of what we want outside of work, things that we want to learn how to do personally, people we want to spend time with. And it's interesting, we've found that when we talk to people about Make Time, they always know. They always know what they want to make time for. The problem is not like what should my goal be or how should I figure out what to do with my life? They usually know, but it's very hard to actually make time for those things.

(00:10:16):
And I think the problem is that most productivity advice focuses on getting better and faster about doing the things that are already in front of you. So, the messages that are in your inbox, the meetings that are on your calendar, a lot of focus on efficiency, like crank through that stuff. Our perspective is basically that those are the defaults. Just like our software that we use, apps that we use have defaults, those are the defaults of life, of the companies that we work in, the culture that we live in. And so, the solution is actually to change those defaults and to really flip this way of thinking on its head. So, it's not about how do I go faster? How do I get more efficient? It's about how do I put the thing that is the most important first in my day or in my life, and then build everything else around that and accept that you're going to need to do a bunch of those little things. You're going to need to answer those messages and go to those meetings, but really, start with the idea of what's most important to you? What do you actually want to make time for?

Lenny (00:11:25):
Along these same lines, we're going to talk about this kind of four-part strategy that you recommend, but a couple of things before we get into there. One is along the lines you just talked about is this insight that you had of just like willpower is never going to be enough to get you to make time for the things you want to do. And you had these two concepts of busy bandwagon and infinity pools, so maybe just talk about those two briefly.

Jake Knapp (00:11:47):
The idea of the busy bandwagon is just this expectation that everybody's busy. And in the United States, there's kind of this thing that I think if you travel abroad and talk to people for a while, then you come back, you'll notice, which is like if you ask someone, "Hey, how's it going? What are you up to?" And they'll be like, "Oh man, I'm busy." It's kind of the default answer. "I'm busy. Things are busy." And it means, usually, it could mean a variety of things, but usually it's good. Like, "Oh, it's busy, so business is booming," or, "It's busy, I'm overwhelmed," or whatever. But busy, it's kind of the expectations that everybody's busy. And we are, I mean we are busy, but we call it the busy bandwagon because it feels like you should be busy. And it's this inner feeling caused by what we see or perceive other people are doing that drives a lot of the stress. And I don't mean to sound like I'm above it all and have figured it all out. It still drives my stress, this inner feeling that other people haven't figured out, other people are expecting fast reactions from me, all this. That's the busy bandwagon, this sort of feeling that I should be busy, that everyone else is busy. And what that does inside of us is really the core of what we have to change and figure out, this getting out of a reaction mode. The other thing that happens to us are the infinity pools. And John, do you want to describe what infinity pools are in our context?

John Zeratsky (00:13:14):
Yeah, we came up with this name because we were trying to think of endlessly replenishing fount of content. So, basically if you can pull to refresh or if it streams, it's an infinity pool. So, this is pure entertainment stuff. This is stuff that people say like, "Oh, I spend so much time on Instagram," but it's also stuff that's important and necessary and productive. Email is a huge infinity pool and it's probably the single hardest thing for the two of us to control and avoid getting sucked into. And anybody listening to this is going to, I think, understand how powerful those pools are and how effectively designed and engineered those products are to be really compelling and to be friction-free and to just make it easy for us to dive back into that pool.

(00:14:15):
And so, when you put these two things together, the busy bandwagon and the infinity pool, you kind of have this, it's like a flywheel, but bad. You feel like you really need to be busy, you really need to be on top of everything. And then, you've got this whole collection of apps and services and products there that are ready to pounce on that, they're ready to take advantage of that set of defaults, that cultural and internal set of defaults that you have about what you should be doing. And for a lot of people, it just sort of spins out of control. So, our view is if you can name those two things, if you can understand those two things, then you can start to deliberately change some of the defaults around them, so that you can put your most important projects, people, work first, like we talked about.

Lenny (00:15:04):
I'm guilty of both these things. I feel like the reason I do some of these chats, this one in particular is it's like one-on-one coaching almost. This is going to help me stick to some of the things you teach. And I've already actually implemented a number of the things you recommend, but this is reinforcing it. And then, obviously, also helping all the listeners get better at these things. Before we get into it, one last question is just like real talk, how how's your guys' productivity? You wrote this book, it sounds amazing. There's 87 I think pieces of advice. How is it going for you guys? As we go through, I want to hear what you're actually using, but just broadly, how's your productivity?

Jake Knapp (00:15:40):
At the top of the interview, Lenny, you asked, "What do most people get wrong when they think about this productivity, time management, whatever?" And I'll frame my answer in those terms. So, most people, I think they try to get better and faster at doing what's right in front of them. We don't change the defaults in our environment, so we can focus and spend time on these different more important things. And if you think of that sort of what do I want to do? What's my goal? What do I want to spend time on that John referred to as project A, generally the things we want to do, these project A things, they're big, they're not easy to start, they're slow to create, dopamine hits, they're non-urgent. Like boss is not asking for them if you have a boss. And generally, the tasks and activities that stand in our way that keep us from doing project A, they're small, they're medium size, it's obvious how to start them, they create dopamine right away, they're supposedly urgent, email meetings, TikTok, Instagram, news, what's on your OKRs, all these things.

(00:16:47):
And I know what's on your OKRs may not sound like it's a peer of those others, but in a way it really can be. So, these big things, they're at odds with these little things that get in the way that the busy bandwagon expects us to do, these things that have infinity pools built in. And so for me, right now, it's a constant battle between the Jake and the busy bandwagon and my inner feeling of how can I live up to people's expectations of me and respond in the way that I should and react in the way that I should? And then, how can I do the project A stuff, the big important stuff? A lot has changed in my life since we wrote the book.

(00:17:28):
The summary is every few months I need a few new experiments. I have found in what has been some trying times that the tactics and the framework that we use... Because it's kind of simple and it sort of fits with these experiences that I've had for many years doing sprints, that it works. And that if I can go back to that, that if I can create space for it, if I can think about this as it's a series of experiments, if I can look at myself with curiosity and say, "Why are things not working out?" And then try to experiment my way out of it that I'm able to. But yeah, so at any given point in time, I probably give myself a B to B-, and sometimes it's a C and sometimes it's a D, and sometimes it's an A, and I'm really plugging away, but it's totally an ongoing challenge.

(00:18:22):
So, I'm not going to sit here and say, yeah, just follow me with a drone for 48 hours and you'll think that's exactly how you should do things. But part of our philosophy, I think that part of the way I look at it is it can be a mess. And yet, if you can create the space for those project A moments, for your highlights, that can shape everything else, if you just have those moments. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that and you still feel really good about your days, you still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.

John Zeratsky (00:18:56):
And having a framework for it gives you a path back. If you're just stuck and you're looking... You're sort of grasping for hacks. You're sort of like, "Oh, I read this blog post about this thing, I'll try it." That might have some short-term effect, but ultimately, you're probably not going to stick to it. You're probably going to fall back into that place of overwhelm and disappointment and burnout. But we find that if you have a system, that you can use the system and you can return to it and continue to build on and experiment, that you can make more sustainable progress on these things.

Lenny (00:19:33):
I think a really important takeaway from these two stories you guys just shared is you don't have to do all of these things. You don't even have to do most of them. If you just do one or two, if you find one or two things that can make you a little bit more productive every day, that makes a huge dent. And so, I think it's okay to feel like, "Oh, I tried this stuff. It didn't work." I think as long as you take a couple of things away today that might be useful to you, and then just try them again in the future. If they end up not working out. Like you delete an app and then you reinstall it, I think that's okay. So, I think that's an important takeaway from this is don't feel like you're failing if you're not doing all of the things that we're talking about today.

(00:20:10):
But let's get into it. There's this kind of four-part framework for how to help yourself be more productive. Basically, if you could just give an overview and then we'll just talk about each of these steps one by one. So, the four parts are create a highlight, laser, energize, and reflect. So, I'll turn it over to you guys just broadly, and then let's go through each of these one by one.

Jake Knapp (00:20:30):
It all starts with this notion of a highlight. And highlight is, I hate to say this, it's the most powerful best part, I think of the whole process. And I hate to say that because John came up with it. It wasn't even me. But I have to admit, it's really good. And I think as folks have read the book and shared it, that's the thing we hear back from people. If you could just do one thing from this book and try this out, it's a big deal.

(00:20:54):
The notion what the highlight is, start your day out and you imagine it's the end of the day, you're looking back on the day. If someone asked you, "What was the highlight of your day," what would you say? What do you want to say at the end of today was the highlight of today? And you start there, just like, "Okay, what would I like to say the highlight of the day was?" And you might think about what's urgent. Sometimes the highlight is this thing that really has to happen today. Today is the day there's a big meeting, or there's this thing I absolutely have to get done for work for tomorrow. That could be your highlight and getting that done well, having good attention to that will be very satisfying.

(00:21:37):
But a lot of times the highlight comes from joy or satisfaction, projects that wouldn't otherwise get attention. And it also doesn't have to just be something at work. It could be people in your life that you want to spend time with, a hobby that you want to spend time on. If you want to get better at Mario Kart, having a good session at Mario Kart, whatever might be the highlight of your day. The notion is just in the morning to think, "What is it and what is that highlight going to be?" And then, try to find a block that's 60 to 90 minutes. That's just usually the rough time we think it takes to really get in the zone on something, do a really excellent job, be totally focused on it. So, that highlight, that's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. And you start that way, you're now trying to shape your time around that highlight, and making sure that you have your peak energy, your peak attention when the time for that highlight comes around.

(00:22:37):
So, laser is about the tactics you might need to actually focus on that thing. In highlight, we have a set of tactics for how to create and think about and frame that highlight. Laser, we have a set of tactics for how do you pay attention when that time comes? Then for energize, it's about having the right amount of energy to do the thing, to pay attention. My highlight for today is trying to be coherent in this podcast, so this morning I need to think about what's the best way for me to have peak energy when a podcast starts.

Lenny (00:23:08):
That's my highlight too, actually. I have [inaudible 00:23:10].

Jake Knapp (00:23:10):
Oh, good. Right on. Okay.

Lenny (00:23:11):
Record a great podcast episode.

Jake Knapp (00:23:14):
Excellent, excellent. Okay. Yeah. And if you're not watching on video, Lenny had a sticky note and he wrote it down. So, that's actually literally the best way to do this is write it down on a sticky note, put it somewhere where you can see it. And so, you've got highlight, laser during the time of the highlight, energize, make sure you have the energy you need when the time comes. And these are just tactics around sleep and food and exercise, and just things that help with your mental energy, not crazy stuff. And then the final thing is reflect, and this is where we think about this as the scientific method. Did it work? Did what I tried today work out? And if not, just being curious about it, what didn't? And adjusting and trying to think, "Okay, maybe there's another tactic I can try."

(00:23:54):
So, the book is like... What are there like 87 tactics in the book? There's a lot of different approaches, but the expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that-

Jake Knapp (00:24:00):
... expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that all of them will work for each person. I use different tactics than John does, and some of his don't work for me, and vice versa. But that idea of centering on a thing, focusing on it, having tactics for that, having tactics for energy, and then having some tactics to reflect and reframe and be curious. That taken together, we find, just can reframe the way it feels. It's not really about productivity. It's not about time management. It's really just about, look, in any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention, and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not.

Lenny (00:24:47):
I think that last point is so important and why the highlight works so well for me is usually there's... You don't get anything amazingly done in a day, often. And usually, you're just distracted by all these things, and you're doing all the easy stuff. You talked about this idea of Project A, like here's the thing I really want to get done, but the dopamine hit us so far in the future, and it's so hard. And so, the reason I think the highlight is so powerful is, you get one thing done you're proud of, that is a great day. And it may sound crazy that that's true, but it's so true.

Jake Knapp (00:25:14):
Yeah, totally.

Lenny (00:25:17):
So, I want to talk more in depth about each of these four things, and maybe spend the most time on the highlight and the laser because I think that's where most of the impact comes from.

(00:25:25):
So, with the highlight, do you have any advice? You shared a couple examples of how to come up with like, "Here's the thing to pick for the day." There's a few questions that you recommend, and I think you shared a couple of them. And then, are there any examples of highlights from your guys', I don't know, past couple of weeks that would be good for people to hear an example? And then, also, there's this calendar component, which maybe fits into the laser, but I guess that feels like a really important element of this. So, if you just talk about that?

John Zeratsky (00:25:51):
For me, and again, this is where the framework is intentionally flexible, different people have different highlights. But for me, I am very project oriented. I'm very work oriented. And for me, most days, a really good day comes from having made progress on something that is really important to me. So, my highlights are usually focused work, creative work related. And this has become even more important since we started our own VC firm three years ago. And before that, I was sort of, I guess, more or less a writer, full-time writing, and speaking at events, and doing some consulting. And before that, I was a partner at Google Ventures, at GV, and before that I was a product designer. So, I've been through different modes and contexts in my career. But if you know any VCs, if you're listening to this and you know any VCs, they're probably the busiest, most frazzled people that you know who are constantly on email, constantly in Zoom calls and meetings, and on airplanes all the time.

(00:27:08):
And so, the natural environment of that work is the busy bandwagon, and it's to have a lot of infinity pools that you need to care about. And so, in that context, in order for us to make progress on projects, in order for us to move the ball on a launch related to this program, Character Labs, that we run with pre-seed founders that's coming up, or we're writing a new book, and that's a big project, or working with one of our portfolio companies and running a sprint with them, or writing a newsletter that goes out to our LPs, those things are all really important, and I feel like they give us a unique edge as a VC firm.

(00:27:55):
If we accept the premise I said before, that most VCs are just sort of frantically running around, if we can take these bigger swings at things, then theoretically, they should really help us be successful. So, most of the time, it's all a very long way of saying that most of the time my highlights are like, "What do I want to accomplish at work? What is the thing that I want to get done today?"

(00:28:18):
And so, what I do then is, I structure my calendar around making time for that. There's a tactic in the book called Design Your Day that is really about kind of drawing out your day, and using your calendar as a canvas where you can design how you want to spend your time rather than using your calendar as a thing that is done to you, a thing that tells you what you have to do. Reclaim control over that.

(00:28:48):
And so, most days, the first half of the day before lunch is my focus time, and I protect that very, very intensely, and then use that time to work on whatever my highlight is.

Lenny (00:29:06):
We had a previous guest on, Neer Eyal, also talking about productivity, and he had actually the same advice of just using your calendar as your to-do list, basically, because that's where time's going to go, what your calendar's telling you to do. So, I think there's a pattern here that I think people need to pay attention to.

John Zeratsky (00:29:22):
Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and I mean, we take it even further, and we have sort of a calendar template that we use as a team. So, we have certain times of the week. And it's not exactly the same for all of us on the team, but there are certain times of the week where it's like, yeah, this is when we do these kinds of things. This is when we have these kinds of meetings.

(00:29:43):
And not to say that those are all standing meetings, although we have some of those as well, but these are kind of the content buckets in the template that we can fill with a specific type of activity, but then other parts of the template are sort of reserved for focus work, reserved for individual, solo time to work on things that we need to get done.

(00:30:03):
So, yeah. I think the calendar is, at an individual level and especially at a team level, is this really powerful tool that most people just kind of... Not only do they not use it as a tool, they just sort of hate it. They're sort of like, "Ugh, my calendar, it's a mess. If I could live without a calendar, that would be the dream." But I think if you can use some of these tactics or use other approaches to reclaim it, and use it proactively as a tool for yourself, it can really help you structure your time around the things that you care about.

Lenny (00:30:41):
Yeah. The way I've been starting to use my calendar is this way, exactly, is I try to prepare for work on next week's newsletter post for like an hour and a half, then prep for the podcast coming up in a few weeks. So, it's very specific and broken up.

(00:30:55):
Along those lines, I often don't do these things as I planned. And one of your principles, something around Groundhog Day, it's okay to repeat it if you didn't do it. If you highlight you didn't do, just repeat it again and again until you do it. Right?

Jake Knapp (00:31:09):
I think that what's so cool about this notion of Groundhog Day. And if you've seen the movie... Well, if you haven't seen the movie, see the movie. What a great movie.

Lenny (00:31:09):
It was a good movie.

Jake Knapp (00:31:15):
If you've seen the movie, you know it's like, not to give it away, but he gets better and better at doing the day, and that's kind of this core philosophy that we take on.

(00:31:30):
I think a lot of the time, when in the past I have thought about, "How can I be effective with my time? How can I be productive?" It's beating myself up. It's not a good feeling to be in that head space of like, "I'm screwing up. What can I fix?"

(00:31:49):
And this notion that it's like, you're going to have another chance, you're going to have another chance. "It's okay, just try again, just be curious about what happened," is a big deal. And starting with the calendar, using the calendar as a framework for saying, "Hey, here's what actually happened. Here's what I think is going to happen." That's what you're saying when you do this Design your Day tactic.

(00:32:12):
And I did this exercise earlier this week. I was switching to a new calendar thing, and trying some new features with... We invest in this company called Reclaim, and they do this stuff-

Lenny (00:32:26):
I'm an investor in Reclaim also.

Jake Knapp (00:32:27):
Oh, well.

Lenny (00:32:28):
How about that? Not planned, this promotion.

Jake Knapp (00:32:33):
Yeah, little [inaudible 00:32:36] there.

John Zeratsky (00:32:37):
It sounds like we knew that, but we actually didn't know that. I didn't know that you-

Jake Knapp (00:32:37):
We did not know that.

Lenny (00:32:41):
How about that?

Jake Knapp (00:32:41):
That was just discovered. So anyway, I was just looking at my calendar, and I was like, you know what? I'm going to do what John does. When I wake up, I'm going to schedule when I exercise, when I eat breakfast. I'm going to schedule when I take a shower, everything, and block it all out. When I walk and feed the dogs, everything's going to be on there, so that then I can have this idea, and when the day starts, I know there's slots for all those things. And then I've found this week that what I thought happened, how long I thought those things take, was not how long they take. And so, set that thing to repeat every day and look at it, and then I'm like, "Oh, okay, interesting. That's not what happened."

(00:33:20):
Okay, so I can adjust it. I can adjust the template and be a bit more kind to myself about this part, be a bit more kind to myself about that part. Gosh, the morning time wasn't a good focus time for me. I'll see if I can... Is there a way I can make that block happen in the afternoon? It's just a helpful way to track stuff and see it.

(00:33:41):
Especially, I think a lot of people are visual learners. We can benefit from seeing things. It's not everybody, but a lot of us are in that camp. And when you put it on the calendar, you can see it, and that helps a lot.

Lenny (00:33:54):
And also keeps someone else from booking that time. Double win.

Jake Knapp (00:33:58):
Not to be undervalued, keeps someone else from booking that time. Right. And they look, they see, oh, okay, Lenny's already got stuff going on. I figured out, okay, I better be cautious before I ask for something. And that default, to be helpful to other people, and say yes when they put something on a free spot on your calendar, defeats a lot of our inner purposes.

(00:34:20):
And one core idea I don't think we've mentioned yet is that we strongly believe in people's intuition about how they should spend their time if they have the chance. What really is important. And that is true. We're talking about running this VC fund, or writing books, which are obviously very like, well, we're in charge of those things.

(00:34:39):
But this is also true, we've been employees in big organizations, I also believe it's true that if you have a boss, and a boss's boss's boss, that you have great insight about what, if you had a window of time, would be the highest leverage thing for you to do. And it might not show up on your OKRs, it might not be on your boss's radar, your boss's boss's boss's boss's radar. You have great intuition, and we want to create space for you to do that thing because you're going to feel better about it, you're going to be more satisfied, and also good things are going to happen.

Lenny (00:35:10):
We're spending a lot of time on this highlight, but I think it's because it's so powerful. It's such a simple idea, but so effective. So, just to kind of give people tactical advice for how to actually implement this, just a couple things that I'll summarize.

(00:35:23):
One is, to pick the highlight, you had a couple of questions I have here, for how to help you pick one for the day. So, you either ask which highlight will bring you the most satisfaction? Or, when I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? Maybe that's the same question. But I-

Jake Knapp (00:35:39):
Slightly different, slightly different.

Lenny (00:35:41):
Slightly different. That's true. Okay, good.

Jake Knapp (00:35:43):
Satisfaction could be like, "I know this thing has to get done, and I got it done."

Lenny (00:35:47):
Good point.

Jake Knapp (00:35:47):
Joy could be like, "Man, that was great." And they're in the same family, but they're cousins.

Lenny (00:35:55):
Great point, great point.

John Zeratsky (00:35:56):
Yeah. And I mentioned, a lot of my highlights, personally, are very much in the urgency or satisfaction camp. They're these big chunky projects. I got it done. I finished that deck. I finished writing that thing.

(00:36:11):
But I also try to stay attuned to when I need something else in my day, when I need... I need some joy. I need some fun, some play. I need to prioritize going for a run, or going for a walk, or cooking a big dinner. And so, I trust my gut on those things, and I say, "Okay, what's most important to me today is not to be productive, but to do something else."

(00:36:39):
And sometimes that's the best highlight for me. For other people, maybe that's their highlight every single day. Maybe they work as a... I don't know, I've talked to a lot of people who work in healthcare settings about this. They're a nurse or a doctor, and when they're at work, they're at work. They're not bouncing around between meetings and emails and Zooms. They're on their feet. There's no time to do anything else. So, their highlight is probably something they need to do at the end of the day to unwind, or take care of themselves.

# $1M to $10M: The enterprise sales playbook with Jen Abel

## Transcript

Jen Abel (00:00:00):
You need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. When you're selling to a leader, you need to be selling an opportunity. The market doesn't want to be sold to, they want to buy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):
Most founders would rather get 10, 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal.

Jen Abel (00:00:17):
In the very early days, people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you. If they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you, they're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:31):
It might be giving you a false sense of success and product market fit.

Jen Abel (00:00:34):
As soon as you become a comparison, as soon as you become one of three that they're testing out, you've already sort of lost. It's all about differentiation. Here's what you will be able to do tomorrow because of how we're going to serve you today.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Something else that you talk about is that enterprise sales is very creative.

Jen Abel (00:00:52):
It's more of an art. It's all about deal crafting. It is a relationship you're building with someone. If they know they can call on you, people will turn over rocks for you. I have a client at a Fortune 10 company where I was like, "It's so important we get the deal done this year. Is that possible?" And she's like, "It's a tall order, but if it's going to help you, let's do it." These are how enterprise deals gets done. It's relationships.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):
What's kind of like the state of the art on go-to-market outbound tooling?

Jen Abel (00:01:18):
I don't use a tool. The thing about AI tools is they're all pulling from the same databases. I want to email someone not in the database that's getting hit by a million folks. I want to take a back door in, not the front door where everyone else is trick or treating.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):
Today, my guest is Jen Abel, co-founder of JJELLYFISH where she and her team help early stage founders learn how to sell and now GM of Enterprise at State Affairs.

Jen Abel (00:04:45):
Lenny, it's starting to feel familiar and I like it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):
I should have said welcome back to the podcast. So I actually shared on Twitter that you're coming back and I had so many people ask so many questions. Clearly, there is a lot of confusion and a lot of need for learning how to get better at the stuff, we're going to talk about sales, enterprise sales to frame the discussion, our first chat, which we're going to point people to if they want to start there, we focused on founder-led sales, which is essentially the beginning phases of a startup, kind of going from zero to about 100 million ARR.

(00:05:17):
This discussion is on the next phase, which is going from about a million ARR to about 10 million ARR in enterprise sales, not like PLG or anything like that. You have a bunch of really strong and counter intuitive opinions and piece of advice on how to be successful at this. So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these things. We'll see where it goes. Before we get into the first one, is there anything broadly, I don't know, is there anything broadly you want to share? Anything you want to say before we dive in?

Jen Abel (00:05:41):
No, let's dive right in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:42):
Okay. Okay, so the first thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about before is this point that you often make that the mid-market does not exist. People often hear about enterprise companies. There's obviously SMBs and startups. There's also people just, "Oh, I'm going to go after the mid-market." Somewhere between. You don't think that's real? Talk about your experience there, what people should know.

Jen Abel (00:06:03):
It's fascinating because if you ask someone to describe the mid-market, actually, if you ask someone to describe the enterprise, every single person has a different answer. It's either based off of revenue, it's either based off of market cap, it's based off of employee size, and I think a lot of people can get lost because selling to a hundred person organization is a radically different game than selling to a thousand person organization and there's no hybrid approach.

(00:06:35):
So the best way to think about it is you have small business which typically can be really powered by marketing, and then you have enterprise, which is typically going to be sales led. If you bucket them into these two very specific silos, it makes it much, much easier to understand what game you're playing. Now, when we talk about mid-market, I usually will say, "Are we talking about the upper end of small business or are we talking about the lower end of enterprise?"

(00:07:04):
And most people are usually saying the lower end of enterprise. And I say, "Great, know you're playing the enterprise game. Know the type of people you need to hire, the type of ACV they need because it makes it a lot easier than trying to have this middle ground that catches everything that doesn't distinctly define SMB and enterprise." So I say the mid-market doesn't exist because what is a mid-market hire? It's either low end enterprise or upper end SMB, and if you bleed those two games you're going to lose. They're so distinctly different. So that's kind of my theory on it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):
You have this chart that you shared with me that will link people to where you kind of show the number of companies within each of these segments and there's basically nobody in this kind of middle segment, talk about that a bit.

Jen Abel (00:07:46):
That's right, and just like the power laws, if you look at the Fortune 1,000 and then the lower end enterprise from there, it trails off so fast. Power laws totally exist in these large corporations and we can't be treating everyone the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):
This begs the question, where do you suggest companies start? There's obviously startups classically are just like innovators, move fast, can make quick decisions, enterprises have all the money. Usually the advice I hear is just don't go after the fancy companies to start because they take a long time. You don't want to screw it up. What's your advice on where to start for most companies?

Jen Abel (00:08:30):
The exact opposite. Early adopters are those logos because they have to continue to stay at the number one spot. So they'll take tons of swings to continue to stay in the ... Staying in the number one spot is the hardest part. So those number one logos are like if you can give me just a slight bit of alpha, just a tiny bit, that's where I get promoted, that's where I get the pat on the back because we are the world's leader in our industry and we cannot be disrupted there.

(00:09:05):
So there's this running joke where not a running joke, there's this running statement where a lot of VCs will say, "Don't go after tier one logos, go learn down market." Or, "o learn from logos that don't necessarily carry a lot of weight." The ones that carry all the weight are the ones that are willing to take a shot and want to help, right? Because they also want to be, they also want to be able to dictate the roadmap.

(00:09:30):
Now it's the founder's job to decide what can be done and what shouldn't be done, but their voice takes you a $100,000 deal into a million dollar deal in a very short period of time. It will literally guide you there. So when someone says, "Hey, go after startups, such as short sales cycle." Yeah, that makes sense. I totally get that. It's very easy to define the decision maker.

(00:09:54):
It's very easy, you don't have to go through procurement, but in the age of AI where it's all about sucking the oxygen out of the room and winning the deal and getting your foot in the door as quickly as humanly possible before someone else tries to take that, you want to get to the enterprise as fast as humanly possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):
Just so folks understand what we're talking about here, when you say tier one, what's a good way to think about what tier one is?

Jen Abel (00:10:16):
Tier one is like your Walmarts, your McDonald's, your NVIDIAs, your Tesla, your ExxonMobil, your UnitedHealthcare, the logos that are the leader in their space, their job is to stay in the number one spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:35):
Wow. Your advice is because this is very counterintuitive. This is exactly what you're here not to do. Your advice is go after the Chevrons and the Mobils and the Walmarts as a startup.

Jen Abel (00:10:46):
Because if you can get them, that's all the proof you need.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):
How do you approach finding someone? Let's just get tactical there. Just like say you're going after Walmart. I know this is not a five-second answer, but just how would someone approach finding someone at Walmart to sell to?

Jen Abel (00:11:01):
First of all, make sure the founder is involved, right? Everyone loves talking to a founder, so we'll start with let's get the founder involved as fast as human possible. The second is you need to vision cast, you need to sell to a gap, don't sell to a problem. There's a very big difference between problem selling and gap selling. Problem selling is highly specific, more technical than not, and it's the way that every salesperson is going to go about it, find the problem and anchor to it.

(00:11:33):
When you're selling to a leader, you need to be vision casting and you need to be selling an opportunity which is they are here, here's where we can take you. You know that image where it's like Mario or Mario, and then there's the mushroom and then there's Mario on blast, and everyone is like, "Don't sell the mushroom, sell Mario on blast." Well, that's exactly what it's saying.

(00:11:57):
It's about selling the opportunity. That's what gets the tier one logos excited and that is the best thing for a founder to sell, selling the vision versus the problem, and also it's what gets them to want to take a swing. Who wants to take a swing because you can do some small problem? They're not going to go to bath for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):
What's an example of a vision cast in a company you've worked with just to make this real? What does it look like when you've done a great job?

Jen Abel (00:12:23):
We have an ability to deliver alpha, meaning, we have information, we have data, we have a way of working that no one else can do or is going to unlock a new way of thinking for you or an ability to deliver to a customer or an ability to solve a problem. Right now, you have an ability to access this level of information. I have an opportunity through our resources or through this gated data, we have access to get you much further upstream so that you can get information faster sooner. It's kind of like the high-frequency trading that one second, that one second. They didn't do much. They didn't sell, "Oh, we're doing fiber cable connectivity. We're giving you one second of alpha before everyone else." It's more of that ability and that's not problem-selling, that's opportunity selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:14):
I like this phrasing of just giving them alpha, that's such a simple way to imagine what this should feel like. We'll link to that image you're talking about with the Mario and-

Jen Abel (00:13:22):
You know that image?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):
Yeah, the person that made that image originally is Kathy Sierra, if you remember her, do you remember? So there's this person, Kathy Sierra, she's from back in the day. This was a big, I don't know, lesson she taught is you want to not sell your people on a feature or a product. You want to sell them on them becoming a superhero.

Jen Abel (00:13:42):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):
They are now a superhero because of the thing you've built for them. And so the vision here is here's how you become a superhero. Here's how this alpha will help you become more successful.

Jen Abel (00:13:50):
And that's why founders are so good at selling because they naturally go to vision selling and vision casting versus a typical trained salesperson is find the problem, ask these questions and it just kills the vibe. It just feels like you're talking to a salesperson, right?

(00:14:08):
It's like, "What's your script? And it's like that's not vision selling, that's like playbook selling." And in the age of AI where a lot of it is Alpha, it's about speed, it's about getting access to information, it's about training data, and look at how the market is reacting to it. It's all opportunity and it's all about the alpha.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):
So just to make this more concrete for people, Sam, like sales person at Cursor, what would be an example of vision casting? The obvious idea there is your team will be more productive, you'll get more done faster than everybody else. Is that a big enough vision to cast?

Jen Abel (00:14:47):
I think it may be more of you'll be able to actually hire the 10X engineers that you don't necessarily have access to because they want to be able to use this type of tool. It's about letting them get differentiated talent or that's probably more of what I would anchor to of this is the 10X engineers use cursor. You don't, do you want access to 10X engineers?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:16):
They won't even join your company if you're not using Cursor.

Jen Abel (00:15:18):
Yeah, yeah. Think about it. So many people are so specific about what they're able to, I think especially technical folks, I'm not a technical person, but I would imagine that they're not going to go to, they don't like to go to these corporations because they're forced to use some incumbent tools.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
Going back to going after these larger companies, I asked your colleague, Justin, what he sees you do that most impacts the success that teams have with their sales process. And there's a bunch of I'm going to touch on, but one is most founders are insecure about asking for large ACVs for charging, or the way he put it is most founders would rather get 10 10K deals than lose nine and get one 100K deal. Talk about your advice there and what you see.

Jen Abel (00:16:04):
There are in the very early days is people will discount till the cows come home because they think that's the way to get a deal done. The best clients are not going to do that to you because that's like a qualification criteria, which is like if they're sitting there nickel-and-diming you being like, "No, I don't believe it's worth this. I don't believe it's worth that." They're not fully bought in on what you're selling them.

(00:16:32):
So when I say I'd rather get $100,000 deal than $10,000 deals, I'd rather have one rock star client that's going to help me figure out the next stage of where this is going than 10 or maybe five that are a good fit, five that are not, and I still have to serve those five that are not a good fit, and that's going to distract me. So this is why I love enterprise sales is they're not going to do the hard work of bringing you in if it's not critical or if it's not, when I say critical, it's going to impact them in a way that they're going to make it successful, that's what I love about enterprise sales.

(00:17:14):
They have the resources to ensure that it gets implemented because most in today's day and age, if people are not using the tool, you just get rid of the tool. So they're going to want to make sure whatever they bring in, what they go to bat for, remember, they go to bat once every two years, maybe once every three years. You've got to make it feel incredible. You've got to make it feel like they're going to be a superhero going back to it.

(00:17:42):
Otherwise, what's the point? Because the way enterprises are structured is it is designed today to make it hard to buy because they want to make sure whatever you're bringing in, you really, really want it gets rid of the mediocre. I think this would be good and it gets to this is going to change the way we work. It's going to impact our ability to capture some form of alpha, however you want to define that for them and it's sticky because of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:16):
So your advice here broadly is don't pay attention to the smaller 10K-ish kind of opportunities for a bunch of reasons. One is it might be giving you a false sense of success in product market fit. Two, those companies are maybe not as innovative and won't lead you in the right direction. Three are probably discounts just like your product than your pricing just gets thrown off.

Jen Abel (00:18:38):
Yep, and also you don't really get taken seriously for 10K. You get way more taken seriously for a 100Ks, it's much harder to get a 100K deal done and an executive use needs to be involved. I'd much rather have an executive sign-off on something and spend two more months getting the deal done because you know that they are bought in, you can now ensure what kind of value do they want to unlock and maybe you have an opportunity to turn them into a user, which to me, in today's day and age, with our generation being the ones that are now the executives at these corporations, this is native to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:15):
Who is this true for? Is the advice here basically, if you're trying to build a successful B2B company, everybody should be aiming towards these a 100K sort of deals? Is there a world where you can be successful with 10Ks for a long time?

Jen Abel (00:19:30):
If you have a super high win rate in a massive market, because all you have to do is reverse engineer the math. If you need to generate a hundred million dollars in revenue, how many 10K deals do you need? And the expansion on a 10K deal is in parallel to that. Where can you go? 10 to 15? That's a 50% growth, much easier to go to a 100K to 500K because they want more bodies or they want more value out of you.

(00:19:58):
For an enterprise, they'd love to get more out of an existing customer. You're already trusted. So it's also about the type of company you are. If you're venture-backed, you can't be selling $10,000 deals to the enterprise, you'll get killed, or you've already lost the game because you're playing a small business game in the wrong sector.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):
Have you seen startups you've worked with succeed in that 10K, 20K bucket or is it really, really rare?

Jen Abel (00:20:23):
If they're going after the enterprise?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):
Yeah.

Jen Abel (00:20:25):
Yes, if it's the first three months and then after three months, it turns into a 50K and then a 100K and it ramps up quickly. Sure, that makes sense. You got your foot in the door and you can expand it exponentially in a healthy manner. I think that that's fine. $10,000 a year, then going to 12, then going to 15, the math will break.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):
This is great. I feel like most founders to this are like, "No, no, we're kind of in that exception we'll be all right. 10K, we'll do 20K. That's crazy to consider 100K."

Jen Abel (00:20:52):
Yeah, the math will break. And also, a really good salesperson, you're commissioned on a 10K deal, they're not going to get a great salesperson. They're going to want to be anchored to how can I sell a $250,000 deal? How can I sell a half a million dollar deal? That's the type of person you want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
And a big part of this is this is a good lens to force you to build the product that you can sell for 100K, 500K.

Jen Abel (00:21:19):
Yeah, absolutely. And again, this is about playing that enterprise game. If you're trying to sell, if you're a small business, if you're in the small business place and an enterprise company comes to you and is like, "I like this." Ensure that you structure it for an enterprise. Don't play the small business team with an enterprise company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:38):
Talk more about that. What does that mean?

Jen Abel (00:21:40):
Let's say you're PLG, and a big company like Walmart comes to and is like, "Hey, can we get access for three of our users?" And they're like, "This is so exciting." And then they sell them the small business pricing for three users to Walmart. Very, very hard now to go from those three users that you just priced them at in a small business way, turn that into 100K because now it's documented what they're actually paying for this.

(00:22:08):
So you're stuck. You've kind of anchored yourself to this price. Not to mention how are you going to unlock the executive high level value so that you can get that senior executive to buy in and stamp this as well. Otherwise, it's just going to be throwing it on the credit card. But again, you've just ruined your enterprise game because you're anchoring to a small business price.

(00:22:34):
So this is why when you bleed these two games, it's very, very, very dangerous because these are really smart companies. They're going to say, "Well, wait a second, I just paid $9,000 last year and now you want to charge me $90,000. Well, what's the step change in value? What's the 10X value I'm now getting?" That's super hard to prove.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):
So the tip here is your initial price will really screw you if you get it wrong. And so obviously we're not going to give people the answer on their pricing strategy fully, but just is the advice just charged more or what would you recommend?

Jen Abel (00:23:08):
It is enterprise companies are very used to a land, when I say the first initial contract, somewhat between 75K and 150K, very used to that. In fact, that's probably where you want to start because you also want to understand where can you grow from this. Start contained, don't say 150K and sell the farm. Say, "It's 150K, here's who gets access, here's the value we're going to deliver and here's where we're going over time." You also want them to know, "Here's what we plan to do roughly in year two, year three."

(00:23:42):
I know it's hard to look that far out, but plant the seed with them in terms of where this is going. If you come in at $10,000, even if they want to bring you in and want to spend 100K with you, they have to be able to defend that and now they see a $10,000, it can get really messy, especially because a lot of them are using AI now to understand contracts. So they're going to quickly say, "Oh wait, you spent a thousand dollars with Lenny and now Lenny is asking you for a 100K. Great. Just help me understand why or defend it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:15):
I could totally see ChatGPT being like, "This is interesting."

Jen Abel (00:24:19):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
It used to be 1K, now it's a 100K. What might be going on here?

Jen Abel (00:24:22):
Totally. The people don't realize how, again, know the game you're playing and don't be sloppy about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
So your advice here is really interesting. There's the land to expand. Expand is very important, but the landing may screw your expanding because it sets the wrong reference point.

Jen Abel (00:24:45):
1,000%. That's exactly right. You said it better than I did.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:48):
And so you may see in theory if you land a 10K go to 100K, that's an amazing NRR, everyone's going to be really impressed. But you're saying people won't buy into that. It's going to feel absurd and wrong.

Jen Abel (00:25:00):
Unless it's defendable. All it needs to be is defendable. But who can really defend? That's very hard to defend a 10X. 10X jump, they're going to want to see 15X value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:11):
Let's talk about design partners.

Jen Abel (00:25:12):
Oh yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
This is something most founders try to do. They find a few folks to work with, to help them build the thing. What's your advice on when to start finding design partners? How to find design partners, what a good relationship looks like?

Jen Abel (00:25:24):
Design partners are incredible. They're the hardest logos to upsell, meaning go from design partner to full rollout customer. So don't expect these people to be your million dollar pipeline. Expect these people to be the guide, to help you understand, maybe design partners could be a technology company in the Fortune 1,000.

(00:25:50):
So they're used to experimenting. They're used to technology, they're used to, they were once a startup, so they get it. Those make really good design partners. Most of the design partners that I've closed are usually technology based. They get it and they also are excited about advancing the org and also giving the team an ability to have that startup feel.

(00:26:12):
So if you're a large massive corporation like Stripe. Stripe doesn't get that startup vibe as much like that 50 person startup vibe, but this can be a gift to give them that lens and give them that voice and give them that excitement that they don't get as a larger company. But those are great types of logos to be early design partners because one, they want to make sure they continue to stay on the cutting edge, but two is they are, to try and build something without that guidance is really, really, really hard because they're not using it.

(00:26:54):
So you need that user feedback and you also need to tie that to the executive value. It's actually a lot, it's very hard to do, but if you can come out of it and upsell a design partner to a full rollout customer, such a huge win for the market for you, for your team, and also for your investors because it's the hardest customer to actually truly convert.

(00:27:23):
They've been it when it was messy, they usually got a low price point. But if you again frame it, say, "Listen, I would love for you to be a design partner. I want a little skin in the game to get you to point it. Here's where we want to go and you'll get a discount because you were in the beginning, but I'm setting the framing. Here's where we want to go with pricing. Here's where we are today. You'll always have 30% concession in perpetuity because you are there with us on day one."

(00:27:49):
So again, it's not about asking for $10,000 and then not expecting that design partner to upsell and keep it flat because there's no growth there. It's a flat. It's about getting that early design partner, set the framing, own the framing and let them know where you're going. Again, a $100,000 to these large logos if they want it, it's very easy for them to get it in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:11):
There's this really interesting underlying piece of advice of finding a company that pulls you in the direction that leads to success. A company that's kind of a visionary. There's the obvious companies that everyone is always trying to get these days, OpenAI and Anthropic and Stripe I think is one. And any advice for just picking the right early? What are signs that this is a company that will point you in the right direction?

Jen Abel (00:28:34):
I think they have to be part of a logo that is deemed startup-friendly or in that world, and then I think it's the person, is this person excited to give feedback? Does this person buy in to where we're going? Do they see this world differently like us? Are they in lockstep with the founder vision?

(00:28:58):
Are they excited to use a tool that's janky? Because it is janky in the beginning, but they know that where this can go can be incredible. So I think it's really about the person and making sure that they're aligned for what they're getting into, and I think a lot of salespeople oversell it. I think that's a common thing that happens and that leads to churn, that leads to frustration, that leads to sometimes just canceling the contract.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
They oversell the initial kind of design partners phase over the product.

Jen Abel (00:29:33):
They sell everything. Yeah, design partner, even full rollout, and it's so, so important to tell them, "Here's where we are today. Here's what we cannot do." Which is just as important. It builds trust. "Here's what we will allow you to do in the next six months. Do you want to be on this journey with us? And it's really ugly right now." Right? "Barely anything exists, but we would love your voice to be a part of it."
