## Transcript

Evan LaPointe (00:00:00):
The brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it. Most people rely on their history department way too much. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, you get dramatically better answers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:13):
I know you have a bunch of awesome advice on becoming more influential.

Evan LaPointe (00:00:16):
It's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game. The starting point is to choose your character. Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy, your personality kind of has a natural fit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
How do we create better relationships within our teams?

Evan LaPointe (00:00:33):
It's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? Not how good am I at my job, how much do I know, how critical am I to this process, but am I a miserable experience? If the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet. You got to fix that first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
I'm really excited for this episode. I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast.

Evan LaPointe (00:00:52):
Then here's the surprise ending.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):
Today, my guest is Evan LaPointe. Evan is the founder of CORE Sciences, which teaches companies and individuals how our brains actually work, and through that lens, how to more effectively work with other people on teams, how to build better products, how to grow your business, and how to make smarter and faster decisions. Evan is a four-time founder, including founding a company called Satellite, which is the fourth largest analytics product on the internet today, which was acquired by Adobe where he later ran product strategy and innovation for Adobe's digital business.

(00:01:31):
In our conversation, Evan shares a simple way to understand how our brains work, and through that framework, how we can get better at vision work, influence, running meetings, having more focus and building better and more productive relationships with our colleagues. This conversation is a beautiful mix of science, theory, and also, a ton of very actionable and concrete things you can do to be more effective in your work.

With that, I bring you Evan LaPointe. Evan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Evan LaPointe (00:02:16):
Thanks very much for having me. I'm excited to share some stuff with people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:19):
I am really excited for this episode because one, I think it's going to be unlike any other conversation I've had on this podcast. Two, I think it's going to really stretch our brains as we learn about how the brain works. Three, I think it's really going to make an impact on how people work and how they relate to other people and work with other people. I thought it'd be great to start by laying a little bit of foundation for people to get a sense of just what they need to understand about how the brain works before we get into how we can actually apply some of the stuff. Could you just share some of the stuff that is really important for us to know about how the brain works?

Evan LaPointe (00:02:53):
The brain is like a big galaxy. There's a National Geographic quote that we throw up in all of our programs that when we train teams, for example, that says the brain is more complex than any known structure in the universe. It's easy to read a sentence like that and just run straight away from the problem. I think that's important for people to not run away from this problem but more run toward it. It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember. The three or four main systems to stack on top of each other like layers, start with the fact that the brain has systems. I think of it like the brain is like a college campus that has different departments in it, and your brain has a science department responsible for open-minded experimentation.

(00:03:39):
It has an art department in it responsible for creative boundless thinking. It has a history department designed for looking stuff up that you already know. If you think about sending your thoughts to the right department on the campus or just different departments, you're going to get super different responses back from your brain. Where we're stuck largely is most people rely on their history department way too much. That's because the brain is actually built to conserve energy, and that's the lowest energy form of generating an answer to a question that the brain can pull off. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, the humanities department of your compassion, et cetera, you get totally different answers. Certainly, if you ever build products as a company or offer services, those departments are going to give you dramatically better answers than the reference material just in your history department.

Evan LaPointe (00:06:34):
That's the first thing is that the brain has these departments and systems in it and it also has pathways. The pathways thing is really important to understand because there's a likelihood that thought will go down certain pathways in each of our brains. Some of that has to do with personality, which predisposes us to have a higher-anxiety or a lower-anxiety response or a higher-creativity or lower-creativity response. You can also be more intentional with these pathways, and that's a big component of self-awareness is to know what are my preferences and then am I actually letting those preferences take over in the situation or might be more intentional steering down the pathways to activate these best regions and systems of the brain. The simplest way to keep track of the systems is there's three, there's three really big ones.

(00:07:25):
There probably are more than three that you can learn about, but the ones we want to have everybody learn about are your safety system, your reward system, and your purpose system. Out of those three, two of them sound really real and one of them sounds like fantasy, to most people. The safety system is pretty obvious to most people. When we're scared, afraid, uncertain, we have doubt, we're resentful, angry, apathetic, etc. This system of our brain is trying to restore our standing in the universe, like I need to get out of this stress, out of this danger, out of this anger, etc. you have an objective that, that part of your brain, that system sets, and you go chase that objective, like I want to get safe. If you're in a meeting, a practical everyday situation, and you're exposed to a statement that makes you feel unsafe, your objective now actually isn't to contribute to the meeting productively anymore.

(00:08:19):
Your brain's objective is to get back to safety. The same thing of rewards that if somebody says you'll get something, if you do this, which is the opposite of safety, that if you don't do this, something bad will happen, then yeah, your brain gets into this pursuit, desire state, which seems great and can be great in a lot of cases, but also, can be pretty narrow. When you hear people say, "That's not my job." That's actually the reward system speaking, saying, "I get rewarded for the things in this list and this thing that you're talking about is not on my reward list and I therefore am not interested in it." I have an easier time pushing away from it because the reward system of the brain is more transactional in a conceptual way. Then you get to this vague and ridiculous sounding purpose system.

(00:09:08):
Until you realize what purpose is, and we've all felt it, if you understand the impact of the thing that you're doing and you understand and care about the people that are impacted by your actions, those are the conditions for purpose, and that can be really big. Like curing cancer, I understand the impact on the people, that's huge. It can also be like I'm writing an email, I understand the impact of this email and the people affected by it. You can feel purpose at this tiny little grain of sand level of your life, not just at the whole beach and shoreline level, and we teach people that, that's super important. That's the foundational layer. Then on top of that, there are a few layers that have to do with your focus because the brain can dramatically shift focus from open mindedness to deep, deep focus.

(00:09:55):
Then there's the final layer of ability, which is less science- y, less neuroscience, and more just practical that your ability is regulated by how much reality you know, like do you have the context for the decision or you just know you're supposed to make the decision? People with context have higher ability than people without. The same thing with imagination and logic that if you push those boundaries in your mind further, your ability increases almost disproportionately to how much you've pushed, so these layers just stack on. I think it's approachable, it's simple. It's like, we can all understand, is my safety reward or purpose system active right now? What is my level of focus? What level of connection with reality, reason and imagination do I have right now? Then there's your output as a human or as a team, and all these things are like levers we can pull, which is super fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):
Amazing. Just to summarize here, so we have these three systems, safety, reward, purpose, then our level of focus, and then there's the ability, are we able to actually do the job? Those are the puzzle pieces.

Evan LaPointe (00:11:02):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:03):
Where I want to take this is when we work with other people, working with other people is very hard, and some of the struggles people have at work in building product, in running a company and building teams, hiring, all these things, is they often get really frustrated by the way other people operate. Some people want to just start building a thing, some people want to really think about it. Some people are very customer qualitative, anecdote focused, some people are very metrics focused. Some people are very collaborative, want to work in groups, some people are very, I want to work alone. Just first of all, we just talked about here's how the brain works and then there's this idea of people work very differently. Can you just talk a bit about just this idea of why people behave so differently in an effort to help us learn to work better with people that are just like, "Oh, that's so strange. This person wants to just their billing.

Evan LaPointe (00:12:02):
Maybe one of the worst pieces of propaganda that people walk around with in their minds is the phrase we're more similar than we are different. My theory on why we walk around with that phrase or why we're told that phrase, if we zoom in on the situations where we hear that is that we have this theory, it's easier to get along with people that are like us. If we fantasize that this person is like me, then I might get along with them better. When in fact, we should probably be building the muscle that we have the capacity to get along with people that are extremely different than we are. That fourth piece that we talk about in our coursework when we train managers, for example, is personality. We talk about your brain systems, your brain focus, your brain's ability, which sort of paints the picture that humans might be similar to each other and we can activate these things kind of unilaterally.

(00:12:54):
Then we have to drop this bomb at the end, which is, and here's why that doesn't work consistently across different types of people. I know you took our profile, our big five-based profile, and that's just one tool out of many that can help a person understand where on these various spectrum of personality traits and motivations they sit. We often use the metaphor in our training of culinary school that we're more culinary school for human performance instead of cooking class. That helps people conceptualize that I'm used to going to cooking classes in my training, here's how to do a one-on-one, here's how to offer feedback, here's a framework for generating product ideas through to prioritization and backlog. We're like, "Well, what's going on beneath the surface? What are the underlying principles and forces at work that all the stuff that comes to life on the surface really originates from?"

(00:13:50):
In this culinary school metaphor, one of the things that's really important for a chef is to actually understand what are my preferences? What do I like to eat? Because if I don't know what I like, then I assume everybody else likes what I like, then I'm not going to be a very dynamic chef. I'm going to be like, "Everybody likes lots of salt and acidity in their dishes." Then you're going to go to Germany and open a restaurant and be like, "That is absolutely not what we're looking for in this cuisine." Self-awareness is a really important step, not just of culinary school, but for everybody. You sit somewhere on a spectrum, your brain has these pathways and these traffic cops directing traffic in your mind. You have to start with square one with yourself and understand, am I prone to try to say things politely, and so that they're received well? Or am I prone to be super blunt and direct and maybe even mean and harsh? Am I prone to sit back in conversations and let things happen, or am I prone to take over?

(00:14:48):
Am I prone to go to intellectual abstract thinking and try to deconstruct ideas or am I prone to stay very pragmatic? If you don't know who you are and you think that the universe resembles you, then you're going to get super lost in that broader spectrum. I think the big five, I mean there's a bunch of models. You have Myers-Briggs, disk, etc. They're just all imperfect ways of measuring personality, but also, useful despite the fact that they're imperfect and especially useful if you take a growth mentality instead of a justification mentality to reading them. If you say, "okay, I'm low in politeness, I'm super direct." Your justification mentality of that would be like, "Yeah, damn right. I'm awesome that everybody knows what I really mean and how I really feel.' Versus the growth thing, which is like, well, maybe there are situations where I can try a little harder than 0% to phrase things in a way that if we work backwards from the outcome, we want to choose our actions right now, would these actions so direct actually increase or reduce the probability of that outcome?

(00:15:54):
That's when we become more dynamic chefs, more dynamic people. Personality is a broad spectrum and self-awareness is the starting point for the whole thing. The big five model gives you a really good list of attributes to scan yourself through, and then you should be making a game plan for how to do that. Then you can turn your attention to the network of humans you're a part of and say, "Okay, well in what ways, because I'm me, am I so different than these other minds?" How can we create a mesh mentality where thought shifts among the group to fit most naturally? In product work, especially, whether you're a founder, entrepreneur, thinking about product at that level and your team at that level, or you're in the thick of product work pushing your mind and other people's minds to get this right, then you're going to benefit a lot from understanding these traits and these differences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:48):
I think the big unlock here for a lot of people is that the reason you are struggling, getting something done, working with someone, being successful at your company, with your manager, with a partner in your team, is they have a very different way of their brain operating, and so they think in a very different way, they react in different ways. You may think the entire world thinks the way you do, but they don't, and these tests help you see that. To make this super concrete for people, are there a couple of examples or wins you often find that you can share of just ways to use this to become better in your job, say this week? Whether with meetings or convincing someone of something, anything along these lines?

Evan LaPointe (00:17:28):
I think one more layer would be helpful to this, especially if you're a leader or a manager, which is the business world isn't just hand-to-hand combat between a bunch of individuals on the blank matrix loading screen. You're actually in a habitat as a company and your team is like a habitat. I think of companies and teams, almost like little terrariums that we're inside of, and is this terrarium set up with sand and a heat lamp and we're a bunch of frogs, like we're going to turn into frog bacon, simply because we're in this habitat? A lot of it is you want to actually create a habitat or an environment that's predisposed to high-functioning thinking and high-functioning interaction between people.

(00:18:15):
Because if the habitat is working against all of you to begin with, then all the hand-to-hand combat that's going to show up is actually largely a function of you just being in this heat lamp, dry, devoid of life, devoid of productive ways to grapple. That's where a lot of teams and companies sit today, especially more established teams. They've either lost their way in the habitat and haven't really set the scene for good, kind of thinking and interaction, or they just never had that to begin with. Some of this stuff, like when you've talked to a couple of other people in the past, your conversation, the Canva conversation, the Figma conversation both come to mind as like it is super obvious the energy that has gone into the habitat to predispose people to high function.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:09):
You're referring to in my interviews with the folks from Figma and Canva.

Evan LaPointe (00:19:13):
Exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):
I see. Oh, say more about that mean.

Evan LaPointe (00:19:17):
You think about the, even in the Canva context of coaches instead of managers. I love this, let me back up for just a second. There's a great quote, I think Dan Pink has summarized the problem better than anybody when he said, "There's a mismatch between what science knows and what business does." In that gap, it says, "Well, what is it that business is doing that science knows better?" You can almost look at this as an equation of science knows minus what your business does equals dysfunction. That is a pretty crystal-clear thing. If you take this managers versus coaches, they're taking intuitively, I think. I don't know if they're neuroscientists, but intuitively, I think a lot of great founders understand humans don't work a certain way, and this whole paradigm of managers seems to be failing a lot. This whole paradigm, like mantra, fail faster. Seems to be failing a lot, and mission statements seem to fail a lot.

(00:20:22):
You look at this, science knows business does as a lens to examine yourself through and stuff that fails very often is worth a look. When you look at, okay, do we really want managers, because that seems to fail a lot? Or is there a paradigm that works better for human beings that activates more human potential and hit the nail on the head? If you do the math of Canva, what science knows versus what Canva does, whether they know they're doing it scientifically right or not, the math equals zero. There's no difference between what science knows and what business does in that case. Also, the Figma conversation, I loved the phrase from that conversation, imagination is a hypothesis generation engine, I think is what the word was.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:13):
Oh, the Dylan. Yeah, the chat with Dylan.

Evan LaPointe (00:21:14):
I loved that idea. Because when we talk about imagination as a part of ability, we talk about imagination's capacity to generate alternatives for you, that's its purpose. It's not just to doodle in the margins in the middle of boring meetings. That's part of it, it's a side benefit. When you look at imagination's purpose, if you have a great imagination, you always have a lot of choices in life. Mickey Mouse was a choice. It was like a new alternative way to send messages through a talking mouse. Like, that's okay, that's interesting. The other part of the hypothesis generation engine that we focus a lot on is it's not just the ability to generate choices and hypotheses, but it's also the ability to load them into your Oculus headset and walk around a world in which that choice already has been executed. That's akin to vision in a sense that do you have a really good ability to load that one branch of this imaginative tree, this one hypothesis into a simulation and then explore what the world looks like with this in place?

(00:22:23):
If you look at this coaching thing, it's going on at Canva instead of managing, you load that in the simulator and you're like, "Boy, this looks pretty nice. This is higher-performance thing." With advocacy instead of regulation, we have growth. There's a whole bunch of aspects that are inherent in that approach where science, and if you ask a neuroscientist, would that work better? They'd be like, "Oh, hell, yeah. That would work way better." Because it activates this in the brain, it reduces cortisol, it does all these things that science knows work much better. There's a whole list of stuff from very deep to very tactical of things we can do differently that reduce the gap between what you're doing and what science knows and the dysfunction just shrinks and shrinks and shrinks as you do those things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:16):
Are there things that you've found people can change in the way they work based on the way the brain operates, whether it's run better meetings, be better influence? What are some things people can try to do this week that will make them more successful at their work or working with colleagues?

Evan LaPointe (00:23:32):
In the list of what science knows and what business does, everything is in there. Culture is in there, meetings are in there, goals are in there, deadlines are in there, team dynamics, all this stuff is in there. We'll probably just pick a few things out of that very long list. Meetings are a good one. Meetings, I forget what the statistic is, but it's some insane 12-figure amount of, no, not 12, nine-figure, no, 12-figure, hundreds of billions' amount of waste is caught in meetings. We spend gazillions of dollars on waste of time and meetings. For us, like in our programs, the average delta is between 10 and 20%. People save anywhere from a full half of a day to a full day per week of work as a result of just cleaning up the way they're using meetings. Some of that is just the design of meetings, like treat meetings like a product and treat them workflows that should be organized and used intentionally, but a lot of it is inside the meeting, like what's the tactic?

(00:24:38):
Here's something super tactical, which is, meetings, generally speaking, are a combination of priming and decision making, if you look at meetings through the lens of the phases that they are. A lot of meetings skip the priming step altogether. They launched directly into decision making. It would be safe to skip the priming step if we began the meeting under the assumption that everybody here is on the same page, has the same information, and generally speaking, intends for the same outcome. I think that's a ludicrous assumption for most meetings, and yet most people are actually shocked to find out that we're not on the same page even though we literally never have been, and as long as you're on day two plus of working together. It's a crazy thing that we don't do priming, and priming can be simple. It can even be done in the invite. One of the things that's crazy about Outlook and Google is you can put a very terrible useless meeting into Outlook and it will never look at it and be like, this is probably useless.

(00:25:46):
Just like you can go into Trello and put the dumbest project in the company's history into Trello, it will ingest anything you put into it without any discernment as to its value. Now, imagine we're going to have to do this ourselves for now until a better calendar comes out, but imagine if Outlook or Google Calendar or Cron, which now is part of Notion, would just be like, "Uh, uh, uh. What is the point of this meeting?" You could say, "Okay, this is here. This meeting is about the generation of options or creative problem solving or very tactical problem solving or efficiency seeking, or what is the category of conversation we are about to have? What are some of the basic principles that should apply? Are we honoring sacred cows or are we eating sacred cows in this meeting? What is the mode mentality, the priming? How can we all say this is the mindset and the ultimate purpose that applies to the meeting?"

(00:26:52):
You can write that and you can read that in under three minutes. It's not some arduous process. Amazon does it in an arduous process, they're known for that. That's wisdom to know, like we need priming. They're wise enough to realize the need for it. They make that a very robust execution. It doesn't have to be that robust. Skipping priming is pretty bad. Other meetings get the priming and the decision-making backwards. We start to open the meeting. You've heard of diamond-shaped thinking, let's open the meeting with expansionary thought and let's end the second half of the meeting with convergence. Well, we start the meeting instead with convergence, realize that we can't reconcile the various party in the room, their needs for convergence.

(00:27:39):
Then you might hear in the middle of a meeting like, "Well, let's start over again and remember why we're all here." We do the priming in the second half of the meeting just in time for the meeting to end. That's a super obvious thing that people can do, but that people very rarely do in priming. I'm happy to generate a list so we don't have to talk through everything, but maybe make some little PDFs or something that people can download that say, "Here's what great priming looks like." Then when you move to the decision making, here's what great decision making looks like, and that way, you can have a little bit of a guide, and again, do your own math, what science knows what we're doing in this meeting. We're skipping a bunch of steps, that's growing the probability of dysfunction or things will going wrong, and let's shrink that probability instead of growing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:28):
Amazing. That'd be sweet if you have that. We'll definitely link to that on the show notes. The advice here is make sure when you're starting a meeting, running a meeting, prime everyone around the problem we're trying to solve or we're trying to get out of this meeting, the context, versus just diving into decision making.

Evan LaPointe (00:28:44):
Very notably, the principles that apply. I think that's really, really important, not just what we're here to do, but how we can think about this best. You can even have a debate about the principles, and it's way better to have a debate about the principles than it is to have a debate about the tactics that are rooted in the fact that you have super misaligned principles. If somebody is trying to make the decision with speed in mind and another person is trying to make the decision with accuracy in mind, it is completely inevitable that they're about to have a cat fight in the meeting. It's not resolvable until they come back and revisit the fact that deeper down, we are approaching this in a completely different mentality with completely different objectives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:31):
Awesome. If you end up having these PDFs of waste to prime successfully, that'd be great.

Evan LaPointe (00:29:36):
For sure. Will do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:38):
Okay, great. Other things that people can do to work with better. I know you have some advice on how to influence more effectively. I know you have some advice around strategy and vision, so maybe we go into those two directions.

Evan LaPointe (00:29:50):
Let's start with strategy and vision, because I think it's nice to be better at strategy and vision before you start influencing people. What you'll encounter in life, in your mind, is ideas are swirling. Whether you're generating those ideas or other people are, is your brain is going to sort those ideas into believed, believable, kind of conceivable and inconceivable. You can come up with your own words for that, but that's like a starting point, which is if somebody says something you've already experienced, it's something that is believed to your brain. If we said we should implement an OKR framework and you've experienced it in a prior workplace or you've read all about Google doing it, then you're going to be like, "Yeah, we should. It would clean up a lot of junk around here. Okay, great." Your brain is already in a yes.

(00:30:47):
If it's believable, maybe you're reading Harvard Business Review and you're reading about things that your business has never done, that you've never done, but there's all this evidence that it works and it makes sense to you mechanically, so you're like, "Okay, yeah, I find that believable." Now we're leaning toward yes, or we're still in the yes bucket. Now we get into these unbelievable, yet maybe conceivable. These are the things that seem to be far-fetched. Going back to the Canva conversation, the conversation with Uri that you had. Most of the things that are totally believed by these leaders are unbelievable to most other leaders. We don't need managers? I don't believe it. Now we've shifted the mind from inbuilt kind of tailwind to inbuilt headwind. This is why minds struggle with strategy and with vision, is that every mind based on personality we talked about earlier, that line of demarcation between believed, we all have different lived experience, so the more experience you have, the more believed you have.

(00:32:03):
Then the believable and then the unbelievable, but yet conceivable, these lines shift a lot from person to person. An idea that totally makes sense to Uri, he's probably been in a thousand meetings where other people are like, "That'll never work." Even though obviously, science knows, for example, it totally will. One of the great benefits of science in culinary school is let's not reinvent ideas that are already proven. We already know that certain things activate people's purposeful state and the full brain that seeks comprehension seats deeper problem solving, seeks human connection. Those are known things, and the same thing as the debate about the value of design sits in the strategy and vision. How do we know there's an ROI to a better design here? Well, if you could disprove that instead of proving it, because the last million people who asked this question proved it.

(00:32:54):
If you could disprove it, you'd probably win a Nobel prize for being the first human to disprove something that is like ironclad. Like, we're done. We're done with this debate. That, I think is what we have to recognize in ourselves. Big part of self-awareness is where our unbelievable threshold begins, where our believable threshold ends. Then the inconceivable is like, get out of my office level stuff. A lot of the vision thinking and dialogue that happens inside of businesses directly activates people's inconceivable response without any self-awareness that, that's a personal problem, not a objective problem. I think it's a really, really important thing for companies and individuals to invest in themselves to kind of say, "Do I have the capacity to recognize the situation that I find inconceivable, but that could be totally wrong?" Then we can avoid the months potentially of arguing that sit between us and experimentation.

Evan LaPointe (00:34:00):
... that sit between us and experimentation. So I think that's the starting point for that. And if we were to do paint by numbers on that, what dominoes do you want to knock down? Know your personality, what you're looking for in the Big-5 model which we lean into is openness. If you are low in openness, your brain essentially has abstract, creative, intellectual, complex thinking wired to the pain systems of the brain. That's how your wiring is. As soon as things get abstract, not only are you like, I don't like this, you have a much more visceral negative response to these types of ideas, and you are now going into your pain cave while somebody else in the room may have all that abstract, creative, exploratory thinking wired to their reward systems.

(00:34:55):
So that's something to really know, and vulnerability is the best approach to this because if you think about the domino two, once you know this stuff, then the question is how do we socialize this knowledge in a team? Let's say it's a C suite, a leadership team, a founder and co-founder and the rest of the leadership team. And we work a lot with YC companies on this here, because it's super important. As they hire people, every incremental hire is an increment of psychological diversity, and it changes everything about how these conversations go.

(00:35:27):
So knowing this, okay, what are our options to socialize this knowledge? Vulnerability is the best option. But Brené Brown will sell vulnerability for its own sake, not everybody buys selling vulnerability for its own sake, because it's a scary thing. But it gets a little less scary when we consider how much scarier our alternatives are. I can pretend to hide this, that's my other option, or I can not hide it, be a Tasmanian devil, and then be unapologetic. So those are your three options, and when you realize I can be vulnerable, I can attempt to hide it, or I can be unapologetic, those other two options are ruinous compared to vulnerability.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:13):
The thing you said about openness and not being good at big vision, brainstorming, super resonates with me, because that's exactly me. So I took your test, what is it called? What do you call this test, by the way?

Evan LaPointe (00:36:27):
CORE identity is what we call it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):
CORE identity test.

Evan LaPointe (00:36:29):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:30):
Okay, cool, and we'll link to it in the show notes.

Evan LaPointe (00:36:32):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:32):
So I took, it's basically the Big-5, agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and formerly known as neuroticism, now called need for stability. I'm looking at it right here. And I'm actually, and I knew this about myself, I'm pretty low on openness, which I don't like to see, but it very much aligns with exactly what you said, I'm not great at big vision thinking. Like when people propose, say a designer on my team proposes this whole redesign big vision rethink of the way we, I'm like, no. It's my pain cave, like you said, and that's exactly what this test reflects.

(00:37:10):
So I think it's a really powerful example of just understanding this is the way your brain is going to respond to things that are totally out there, inconceivable, or how would you call it? Somewhat conceivable but not necessarily believable, and that being aware that that's how your brain works is really powerful, being aware other people have a very different experience with that is very powerful. And your advice here is one, this combination of this habitat, create this habitat where you have all these versions of people's ways of thinking, where some people are in their happy cave when they're thinking big, and then along those lines, your point about vulnerably sharing, hey, this is me, I am low in openness, people need to understand this on my team, and let's work together to not let that hinder us. Is that right?

Evan LaPointe (00:38:04):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, because if you think about these ideas as pegs in holes, we're going to take a creativity shaped peg and try to put it through a more pragmatic shaped hole, there's a translation problem there, and it's a huge burden. If the team actually needs to be innovative, it's a huge burden just in terms of time spent on that translation, to translate the visionary strategic ideas that are accurate but are inconceivable into ideas that feel believable for those who need that more grounded thing.

(00:38:45):
And of course the most common scenario here is ROI, which is the classic question to ask about any idea, what's the ROI? Well, if the idea is inherently generating nth order effects instead of first order effects, like what is the ROI of having fresh flowers in the lobby of a Four Seasons hotel? There's two possibilities for the Four Seasons, they either have an answer to that question which satisfies the pragmatic shaped hole, or they have said in their habitat, we don't ask those types of questions because they're a huge waste of time.

(00:39:28):
And if you're thinking about a competitive market, most of the people that you interview are in highly competitive markets, the team that spends less time translating satisfactory language before they move, which inevitably they'll move, and sometimes they'll move because the market forces them to. They spend so much time locked up in the ROI conversation or the justification, the translation conversation, that eventually customers start leaving, employees start leaving, and they're like, oh, okay, it's becoming more believable now. Well, because moved out of the realm of ideas into the physical world that we can see right in front of us.

(00:40:05):
And that team, because they got stuck in the translation phase instead of the experimentation phase, has a huge disadvantage in the market, and if you're competing head-to-head with one team, this is what I loved about the Figma conversation, that habitat inherently is built for speed because the habitat itself, words are tattooed to your brain that are like, we will not spend time in the translation phase, we will not spend much time. And we see this a lot in the interplay between finance departments, product departments, and things like that, where an overpowered CFO can start asking questions for which there are no answers, that just we're dragging the team into a different language that is much more literal than the more experiential language of the business, so you can see this play out all the time.

(00:40:59):
But I think vulnerability is great because if you are sitting in a meeting, you Lenny, and you say, this is not my thing, basically everything you're saying is inconceivable, now I'm being honest with you, nobody's going to hate you for being honest, they're actually going to be glad that you are honest about the gap instead of glad that you are super certain that you are the right human to index off of in the decision-making process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):
And the thing you recommend being open about is this is my personality, this is my CORE identity, I don't know the language you'd use, but it's not I think all this is inconceivable, it's I think all this is inconceivable because this is the way I think.

Evan LaPointe (00:41:41):
Absolutely, yeah, unpack the detail, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):
Got it.

Evan LaPointe (00:41:43):
Yeah, I mean tell people, this takes my brain, all this abstract and creative future-centric thinking that's not rooted in the concrete is where my brain goes, alarms go off and I'm like, I need something concrete. So if you can give me something concrete, I'm more comfortable, but at this point I have to maybe move into a lot of trust, and trust may be my alternative to agreement, right?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):
Yeah. And there's also, I imagine, what I always do is I recognize, hey, I'm not amazing at this, let me push myself to be more open to these things and find partners that are really good at this and let them drive the ship more.

Evan LaPointe (00:42:26):
Yeah, and it's great, one of the things that's so cool about the YC teams that we work with is they're so sophisticated and so smart. So even though they might run into this roadblock, A, they're going to do exactly what you just said and they're going to push themselves. You may notice in your profile the dot that you scored is surrounded by rings that represent how hard it is for you to push yourself to think in different ways, to think beyond the home base way of your brain working.

(00:42:55):
Now at a certain point your brain breaks and you move into foreign territory, and there's a level of, I mean, if you are a very conservative person and somebody's like, "Let's go to Burning Man," that will break your brain. You don't go all the way to the other side of the spectrum necessarily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:13):
For the record, I've been four times, even though I'm apparently low in openness.

Evan LaPointe (00:43:17):
Perfect, and there's lots of reasons to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):
Got married at Burning Man. Makes me feel better about my low percentile.

Evan LaPointe (00:43:25):
But you're pushing your brain. I mean, Burning Man's actually a great example because there are a bunch of different reasons you might go. And if you go for one reason, then you're exposed to the other reasons. And that may be interesting, and you may kind of venture closer to those other reasons. You may be like, I'm going to stay in my reason bubble within the greater context of this place.

(00:43:44):
So there's a whole bunch of... And business is no different, you can say, okay, I'm going to push myself, and I may get into these places that go beyond my brain's flexibility, where the elastic band reaches its limits, and then from there I'll trust people and I'll have people, what I was going to mention about the YC founders is so many of them are so smart that they're really able to efficiently translate what they see beyond where your band stretches into the language you feel comfortable with, quickly. Other teams do that really badly and they just accuse you of, "Why can't you see this?" And then you get even more stuck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):
How much shift have you seen in people, say they take this test and they're like, as I am, 23rd percentile in openness, do you see people move meaningfully across this if they work on these sorts of things, or is this just like, here's who you are, you're not going to change significantly?

Evan LaPointe (00:44:41):
Personally I'm more concerned with the effect on teams than on people, because if you look at this through the... I've been a four time founder, and if I look at this through how is my company working? How are my teams working? I don't need all the individuals to get to perfect, I need, especially in cases where there's this translation issue where a team is working on something and some part of that team is saying, "Let's stop here and let's dwell here." If they can move enough that the team, the effect on the team is now freed up, that's what we really feel as a business.

(00:45:23):
So to answer your question directly, people can move a lot, especially through the first three rings of that range that we depict, really, really well. Self-awareness is actually kind of the key, and self-awareness and self-consciousness, the difference here is that self-awareness is simply being intentional with your brain, whereas self-consciousness is being worried about your brain. We don't want people to be worried about their brains and insecure, we just want you to say, this is a situation in which my brain can work this way, and this is a situation where I want to push myself.

(00:45:56):
So it's being intentional, and we talked a little bit before this episode about this instinct versus intellect duality in the mind, and essentially you're just using your intellect to either verify or improve your instinct. You're always going to have instinctive responses about risk and fear and uncertainty and doubt and need for data, and all these types of things, but then your intellect can come in and watch that part of your brain thinking and say, you're super worried about the risk of this, but it's actually pretty low stakes for us to jump in and try. So your need to stabilize that is a little misplaced, and your intellect, that's really what you're doing is saying, how much do people change? I don't really worry too much about how much they change, it's more about how much they can spot with their intellect something that's misfit to the situation, and then take what they're motivated to do, and what they choose to do, and separate them. It doesn't matter if we change your motivations, if your choice of behavior and your underlying motivation can be different from each other, that's awesome, those people are super. And we all know people like that, where you're like, I know this person is uncomfortable right now, but they're totally making it work, and I really appreciate that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:12):
Yeah, part of the reason I ask is, I was talking to you about this before we started recording, I want 99th percentile at all these, I just want to nail this. And I know that's not how it works, I know you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can't be amazing at everything. But that's funny my mind goes there.

(00:47:28):
Just to close the loop on this advice around getting better at vision and strategy, if I were to reflect back what I'm hearing its be very self-aware about what you are not strong at, say openness. Is that specifically the one to focus on if you're trying to figure out how to get better vision and strategy?

Evan LaPointe (00:47:46):
So there's a whole bunch of stuff... Well, let me try to make the list simple. Openness is the biggest one because it is essentially your tolerance of vision and strategy, and the lower that is, the lower you will tolerate the abstract pieces of the puzzle, for sure. The outlandish and purely creative and rules-breaking components of strategy and vision, lack of precedence, those types of things. Now the other thing to look out for is as your conscientiousness rises, which is essentially your desire to be efficient, effective, busy, not waste time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:23):
I'm high on that one.

Evan LaPointe (00:48:25):
Yeah, structured and organized, that is another contributor in the negative, which is it's objectively great to be a conscientious person, there are so many benefits, until we have to waste time productively, or we have to break order in organization. And then that strength that four days a week, or 28 days a month is great for you, on those days where we go and have the offsite and say, what if we blew it all up, to your example of new design, new website, blow it all up, start over again, different direction, that's where the conscientiousness is going to be like, why are we doing this? Why are we having this conversation? What's the need? This is inefficient, I could be spending my time doing something else.

(00:49:09):
And sometimes that'll express itself even in meetings of, I was in a meeting one time after we were acquired, this was eight or nine years ago now, and when you're a founder and you get acquired, there's a new flavor of habitat that you find yourself in with very new rituals. And one of the rituals that I find myself around a lot was the ritual of saying, we can't talk about this for the rest of our lives. And we would be about six minutes into a meeting when somebody would drop the, "We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives" line, and I would look at my watch and be like, "I didn't realize that you were terminal, I mean, why are you even in this meeting if you're about to die?"

(00:49:53):
Because my take on this is we are super far away from the rest of our lives right now, why are you saying that we can't talk about something for six minutes when the diminishing return of added information in the priming of this meeting, to use that again, you knowing X quadruples your decision quality, and you are resisting knowing X. Now we're going to hit a point where you knowing Y, Z, etc, we've hit a diminishing return and now I'm improving your decision quality by 1% instead of by 4x. But we haven't established any sensitivity in this room to the diminishing return curve of incremental thought and incremental information. And this is like a new habitat, I'm like, in this habitat do people really hate thought? Do people really consider themselves to be the police that watch the mean streets of intellectualism for any activity? It's just kind of crazy. But yeah, that's kind of the practical side of this, is you got to watch out and you got to be careful, and that's why I habitat is such a big deal because that's a perfect example of a well-intentioned room with mostly people that are there for the right reasons and the right outcomes, but where this normalness of saying a phrase like that, or saying, "I disagree." Same meeting person goes, "I completely disagree," and I was like, "With everything?" "Absolutely everything." And I go, so let's look at the meta, the overhead camera of this meeting.

(00:51:33):
This was the initiation of combat, that's what the brain is seeing. All the brains in the room are like, oh, fight, right? And now what are our objectives? My objective now becomes win, their objective, because they've taken a huge risk of saying, I disagree with everything, becomes win, and because they are disagreeing with a lot of stuff that they don't understand, the inevitability is they're about to be annihilated in this room where they have both said, we can't talk about this forever, and now put all of their chips onto the table to say, "I completely disagree," instead of, "I have a question," or, "Can we pull that thread?" Or, "I don't see how these dots connect."

(00:52:15):
So that on a super tactical level, there's things we say that activate the amygdala, the combat mode of the brain, versus a different choice of phrase which is going to activate the prefrontal cortex which is like, "Hey Lenny, you're connecting these two dots, I'm not seeing how they're connected," logic, now let's activate the prefrontal cortex with this sentence instead of, "Lenny, that's dumb, I completely disagree," let's activate the amygdala instead.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:43):
I want to talk about this habitat point you're making which I think is really important, but just to close the loop on the strategy vision piece, so just to give people some very tactical advice is, basically understand your personality, maybe take this CORE identity test, or something like that, understand if you're low in openness and high-end conscientiousness, maybe you're not amazing at vision and it's going to be hard for you to think big and think of it-

Evan LaPointe (00:53:06):
Yeah, your brain is just going to feel agitated when you're around vision. But, I mean, you can still do it, right? You can still ask people to translate. The key tactic is, okay, it's not this you're predestined to suck, it's more if you're low and openness, especially if you're also high in conscientiousness, then recognize your native language for ideas is a mismatch for the native language of vision and really, really good strategy.

(00:53:35):
And then you can be open about that and you can ask for some translations, and you can ask for... I mean, trust doesn't have to be non-participation, you can actually say, it would help me trust if you could explain this gap. A great example would be a second order effect, why should we have awesome documentation? How are we going to make more money if we have awesome documentation? Great question, don't be hostile in the way you asked it, but just help me understand, what thread are we pulling? Well, we're pulling this thread of customer satisfaction, retention, recommendation, et cetera, Stripe is really good at this, especially from the early days, that great documentation justifies all sorts of second order effects that then will lead us to this first order effect you're asking about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:20):
Awesome, okay, that's really great. And I was going to go one direction, but I want to talk about this real quick. Something that comes up a lot on this podcast is the power of leaning into strengths and not feeling like you have to be amazing at everything, and that in this example, I have a low openness, high conscientiousness, I can still be very successful in the role by, in my opinion, leaning into things I'm actually really strong at, say conscientiousness, and I'm also high in agreeableness. I don't like the sound of that. Thoughts on just, it's okay if you're not amazing at vision because your openness is low, but you can be better at other stuff and together you can be really successful no matter how your personality.

Evan LaPointe (00:55:03):
Absolutely right, yeah. I mean, the truth is we look at, taking that Canva example of coaches and managers, not only does that change the way an employee feels about the way this connection they have is invested in them, but it also changes inherently a lot of the meeting dynamics and teaming dynamics from hierarchical feeling things manager to more mesh based intellect. And within the mesh, you don't have to worry too much about the hierarchy anymore. You can say, this is the nature of my contribution.

(00:55:39):
So even in the vision and strategy piece, maybe your contributions to idea generation, there are going to be some, and they're probably going to be good. But those are not ideas to protect in the state that you brought them to the table, they're ideas to set on the table so that people can surround them and improve them. And then as other people contribute ideas that aren't as natural to you, kind of just realize we're not in the phase yet of judging and ranking and prioritizing these ideas, that's not where we are in the overall storyline. So let it happen, and then if you can improve those ideas, improve them.

(00:56:15):
And once ideas have that early stage, that kind of like what Jony Ive described as the infancy of an idea, when it's really weak and delicate and susceptible, if you can nurture that idea to adolescence where it has a little bit of ability to defend itself, then now you're in a situation where your conscientiousness can start to think about things like how would we resource this? What sequencing makes the most sense? What is the ROI of these things relative to each other? And consider the second and third order effects, and so on. And what would the project plans, and to your point of being both conscientious and agreeable, you are this master of coordination and alignment naturally.

(00:56:56):
So when that phase of the project begins and we have to get people bought in, high functioning together, getting on the same page, staying focused, getting the project done, all of the people that were good at the beginning with all the vision and strategy, they are just a complete disaster in that phase. That's just how things really work in the real world, and I think we're so, again, focused, like we talked about at the beginning, we alluded to the fact you have to unpack enough complexity. I love the Einstein quote, " Make things as simple as possible but no simpler," and we've made things way simpler than possible in business by saying this is the right way of doing the whole thing.

(00:57:41):
It's like, no, no, no, if you've ever lived a day in real life, building a real product, the dynamics shift a lot throughout the course of product life cycle, as an example, or really any life cycle as an example. And the peak humans as the dynamics shift are very different, peak humans. Lenny is awesome here, contributes here 10%, contributes here 98%. Evan contributes 98% here, please get Evan out of the room when it comes to these meetings, that's great. And yes, we should lean into our strengths, but not so much that we don't know our weaknesses, because another human strength on your team is the patch for the bug of your weakness. And we run buggy software in companies and we say, "Oh, I am leaning into my strengths, I don't need to worry about my weaknesses," well, then you become the person who needs everything translated into your language because when your weakness flares its head up, it slows everybody else down.

(00:58:41):
So it's really, just from an operations business fluidity perspective, a team that is highly unaware of its weaknesses is going to have a lot of slowness and a lot of problems as a result of that. They don't have to fix all their weaknesses, but be aware of them and know who is a patch to your weakness.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):
Evan, this is so interesting. I love that we're digging deep on this. Is there one tactical thing you could recommend for someone to become better at openness in, say, a brainstorming experience when they're doing vision, or when they're low at this, say me.

Evan LaPointe (00:59:13):
I think the best exercise for a conscientious person especially to feel more open is to become obsessed with reverse engineering. And it's to say, there's two forms of reverse engineering that I think are really helpful here. Number one would be reverse engineering against a desired outcome, to truly understand the inputs that generate that outcome. And if we think about that at a big level, like, okay, we want to win a market, what are the real inputs to deconstruct that outcome and understand what our strategy should look like to attack all of the most relevant inputs that generate that outcome? I think that's the specific form.

(00:59:55):
And then at a super tactical level, if you want to give feedback to somebody, and let's say, for me, I'm low in politeness, you're probably much higher in politeness than I am, and I struggled for years with feedback to generate the intended outcome. I delivered the feedback, but the delivery wasn't the intended outcome, and the way that I delivered it actually reduced the probability of the intended outcome because I was being too impolite, too direct in many cases, too harsh. And what does harshness do to the brain? Well, that's crystal clear. So what I was doing and what science knows were very different things, and that's why I failed in those cases.

(01:00:35):
But as soon as I started closing the gap and realized I need to try harder to think about the story arc of this feedback, that becomes clearest to me how to do it when I have the intended outcome in mind for the feedback, I really would like this person to start turning the corner on this particular way of thinking. If you and I worked together and it was about openness, we'd be like, what are some things that I could do right now to increment and set the stage for a big shift in openness as time goes on that you are bought into? And that's a very, if I'm impolite and be like, "Lenny, what's your problem? Why can't you do this? Everybody else can do this."

(01:01:13):
Your willingness to start turning that corner, I mean, it may be there, the safety system is activated, like, oh, bad things could happen if I don't do this, but I don't want your safety system to motivate this change.I mean, in most cases, that's an optics based change instead of a material change that will occur. And that's why a lot of people, accountability is a great example, asking for accountability is the best way to not get it, because asking for accountability activates people's safety systems, or especially saying, "I'm going to hold people accountable." Then everybody's like, oh, great, we should set up a whole movie set of facade houses that pretend everything's great with no substance behind them, and that's why so many companies end up that way. But yeah, I would say that's the tactical.

(01:01:58):
The second thing to understand about openness and reverse engineering is just situational awareness. Very few conscientious people spend, in my opinion, as a very open person, enough time immersing themselves in the reality that is every day situational awareness necessary to do their job. Simplest example of this is how many executives have ever talked to N greater than five customers? That is a... Because, well, I'm busy. I got a lot of stuff to do, I don't have time to go take a world tour, which is like we don't have the rest of our lives to talk about this. I'm not asking you to take a world tour, I'm asking you to stuff into your brain enough situational awareness that the decisions you make every day that affect all those people you're not talking to are considering those people that you're not talking to.

(01:02:49):
So less about an intended specific outcome in this case, and more about, do I really know the... I would think about this as if we think about aeronautical engineering, do I actually have an understanding of the conditions, the flight conditions, that I'm in every day in order to fly really well? And the answer to that for a lot of people is no. So reverse engineering is probably the whole category. I don't know if that makes enough tactical sense, I'm happy to be more descriptive, but that's the category I think is have you reversed engineered how to get outcomes and have you reversed engineered to predispose your mind to come up with really good ideas and good decisions, as opposed to come up with decisions that are super disconnected from reality.

(01:03:37):
Great example being PLG, I mean, if you haven't done enough situational awareness work, you have no idea if PLG is a remotely viable strategy for growing your business. If it's remotely relevant strategy for growing your business. And company after company after company has leadership team obsessed with this concept that in principle we should be able to let people just sign up and swipe a credit card and onboard and great. No, we have a hyper technical solution, that is never going to happen, or that's not the way they do budget, or there could be any number of ways that that's not going to work out, and those are just some concrete examples.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.

(01:05:38):
It feels like there's a fractal of stuff we could talk about and endless threads of things that I want to dig into. Let me shift a little bit to influence, we mentioned this a little bit earlier. I know you have a bunch of awesome advice on how to build your skill at becoming more influential, that's something a lot of listeners of the podcast, or product managers, also founders, need the skill. Who doesn't need to become better influencers? What can we learn about how to become better influencers?

Evan LaPointe (01:06:05):
We'll probably unpack a second topic and open up an off ramp here right at the beginning, but there's two things, there's influence itself and then there's relationships, and we should probably talk a little bit about relationships. Trying to exert influence through a dysfunctional relationship is not going to go great. And most human beings, especially when they go to work, are pretty out of sorts when it comes to relationships.

(01:06:36):
And you even hear crazy mantra like we have to each other to work together, which are like, good luck with that. I mean, just watch a text message pop up on a phone of a person who doesn't like you and watch their response time to the text message, or their Slack message, or whatever. I mean, you're talking about you've built in a multi-day, at least multi-hour delay into responsiveness purely because the relationship isn't good, and then you compound that effect over whatever size your company is. That's massive operational inefficiency just because I don't want to respond to Evan right now. So that's the one piece.

(01:07:19):
Now assuming the relationship is in place, and we'll come back to that and talk about that because a whole very actionable framework to unpack, assuming the relationship is good, I think the starting point for influence is to choose your character and choose your mode. It's almost like you're playing Elden Ring or some video game, and you're going to be like, am I going to influence him this way as the hero or the exemplar of these things, or am I going to influence through back channels, what is my character? And everybody for your personality has a natural fit for the character you're going to select as this mode of influence, and then you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast.

Evan LaPointe (01:08:00):
Then you're going to pick a speed of influence, which is slow, moderate, or fast. The habitat can help a lot with this. If a founder is listening to this and you haven't created a habitat where fast influence is easy and the permission isn't there, then you're slowing the company down inadvertently by just not clarifying this with the team. So slow influence is the we'll let them find out the hard way influence. They're going off a cliff, we know they're going off a cliff. And a lot of times we find ourselves in what's called the Abilene paradox.

(01:08:39):
The Abilene paradox is where everybody in the room knows it's a bad idea, but we're all like "We're in." And the classic Abilene paradox kind of if you look up memes on Google, it'll be like the dad thinks that the kids might want to go camping. Mom doesn't want to go camping, the kids don't want to go camping. Dad also doesn't really want to go camping, but everybody's like, "Dad probably wants us to go camping, so let's give it a go." And they all go and don't enjoy it. And we see that play out all the time.

(01:09:09):
And a lot of people will just say, "I can't do anything. I don't have any influence in this case. We're just going to let him fail and they'll learn." Or this impolite person like me giving feedback the wrong way years in the past, I'm not going to sit Evan down and talk to him about this. He'll figure out on his own through failure that this doesn't work. And that can take months, that can take years, that can take a lifetime for people to learn the slow way. And it is a form of influence. You are being intentional to say, I think the world will create enough failure that adaptation will occur. That is a form of influence, just the slowest one.

(01:09:48):
And a lot of people listening probably realize, "Oh, that's what I'm doing. How can I go way faster than just letting things fail?" So that's where moderate influence comes in. And a great book to read for a moderate influence is the Challenger Sale. And in the Challenger Sale, what we're looking at is the concept of teaching people something. And then when they live with this new knowledge, they'll see things that they weren't seeing before. So for example, in the feedback example that we can keep using over and over again through this is, "Hey Evan, you might want to notice people's body language while you're saying these things and here's some signs to look out for that when you've done this and you get this, that's probably a sign that people are bought in and still with you. And when you see this, that's probably a sign that people are pushing back."

(01:10:37):
And you can ask this question in that moment and you'll probably hear answers like this. So you're like giving somebody a tool that their future is going to unpack. And the Challenger Sale kind of assumes a long enough sales cycle where you're not going to land the sale in the meeting, you're not trying to close them right there. You'll teach them some stuff and you'll, "Hey, if you see this stuff, that's a pretty clear sign that you need to take action. So why don't we call you in 30 days, and 30 days later we get on phone, "Hey, have you been seeing this?" And they'll go, "Everywhere I look, I can't not see it now."

(01:11:13):
And that's how you influence a person in a few days, a few weeks, maybe a few months at worst, way faster than letting them fail.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:22):
We actually had, I don't know if you know this, we had the author of that book on the podcast, Matt Dixon, I think his name. And the Challenger Sale, the idea there is challenge their perspective and view on what is actually real about the market and what they need.

Evan LaPointe (01:11:36):
Exactly. Yeah. I think yes, there's the challenge component to it, but I think the underappreciated piece of that methodology is that you're still letting that person see the world, but you've given them new information that is breaking some calcification in their brain challenge. It's not the moment of the challenge where all the magic happens. There's moments that occur later that continue kind of putting that calcium, lime and rust melting formula on this expectation or this kind of decision in their mind to the point where sometimes they'll turn around and be like, "Thank you for even telling me this."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:19):
So the advice here is if you're trying to influence someone, try to figure out what they don't know. Find information that you know they may not know because once they know that and they may be like, "Oh wow, I totally see what you're saying."

Evan LaPointe (01:12:33):
Yeah, exactly right. And let them know it and let them live with it. Don't cram it down their throat and make them accept it If they live with it just a little bit, even just a couple days, that might be enough to come back to a much softer conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:47):
Does this connect to what you said earlier, which I love this idea of pick a character, like pick your influence style based on your personality, whether it's back channeling and that makes me think of a very specific person. He's coming on the podcast actually, he's this Jedi that just gets people aligned but very behind the scenes, very the meetings before the meetings. So that's one character or it's just telling a compelling story probably in a deck. Or there's other character I guess. Does this idea of sharing information, is that a type of character or is that just something that everyone should just do because a really effective strategy?

Evan LaPointe (01:13:27):
I like the idea of intentionality in just about everything. Are we letting trade winds push us into certain things or are we actually making choices? And I think that step of being intentional about your style and this kind of notion of a character is a wise step to take so that you can kind of have some guardrails as you go through this and some consistency. It helps other people understand the role you're playing in influence. If you are consistently coming from the same place, you're about that style, like I want to try to influence this organization by doing this way and you're going to see that from me over and over and over again.

(01:14:07):
You kind of have given yourself a little permission and also you can get some buy-in from people. If you do want be more the barbarian kind of approach, you can say, "Hey, I'm the devil's advocate approach, or I'm the break it and see if it still stands after I hit it really hard with a sledgehammer kind of guy." Is it okay if I do that over and over and over again? And now you've bought future you the permission to approach things in certain ways that would yield meaningfully different influence outcomes, like meaningfully different. I was able to do this and it accelerated something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
So the way I am hearing this is there are many ways to get what you want, think about your personality style and find the path that is most aligned with the way you operate.

Evan LaPointe (01:14:52):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:52):
Whether it's behind the scenes, whether it's a compelling story. Awesome. So this character is basically figure out what your... It kind of comes back to leverage your strengths, what are you good at? And use that channel to convince people of the thing you want them to be convinced of.

Evan LaPointe (01:15:08):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:11):
My mind goes to what are the list of ways, what are the character options in this list when I'm opening up the game and choosing? You went through a few, but just to give people like, oh, okay, I see I could try it this way. Is there a small list you could share of just like here's ways you could try approaching influence.

Evan LaPointe (01:15:27):
Probably the dimensions are most valuable to people. I would say one of the dimensions is compassion, which is do I want to influence by trying to help people, by trying to make sure that we get it right and that people get value. And then the permission I'm seeking there is can I ask questions about why are we not thinking about the user right now? Why are we not concerned with the value they're getting and challenge us in that way?

(01:15:59):
I think there are characters based on logic and even belief, which is I would like to be the one to insert more knowledge and insert more causality into conversations and challenge causality in conversations to make us think harder and challenge what we believe and break up the sacred cows of the stuff we walked in the meeting with so that we feel differently about things walking out of meetings.

(01:16:27):
So I think there's a bunch of different very useful dimensions. One could be very creativity based. If you follow this big five format, they're kind of spelled out for you. Enthusiasm, interesting dimension. I want to challenge us through the lens of what do people get excited about? What makes people feel good? Does this make people feel good? And are there tweaks we could make to the product or this marketing campaign or whatever.

(01:16:54):
Look at what Siki just did with Runway. I mean I love that guy so much and there's so many components of his character and obviously the characters he surrounded himself with that contribute to really next level stuff. And they're definitely challenging each other using these dimensions of compassion to be the character of caregiver or the character of protector. And so there's a bunch of different ways you could turn those dimensions into characters.

(01:17:28):
But I think when you see the value of each of those perspectives, especially in product, I'm a really big fan of product. If you have dysfunctionally high compassion, dysfunctionally high openness, you have internal rewards and motivations to explore regions of product that other minds aren't exploring as intuitively. And you don't have to have the whole deck to be amazing at product. But you have some unfair advantages if you are super prone to reverse engineering just by your nature. You are going to be more situationally aware and probably make a series of vastly better decisions than the team that has a lot less situational awareness than you do. It's a huge advantage.

(01:18:16):
But when it comes to the concept of influence. I mean figuring out these dimensions that define who you are and then using them to kind of say, "I want the permission to ask a series of questions and challenge our thinking through this very intuitive strength that I have." Can we all see the value in that or do I need to further sell myself? And then you'll find you can take on that character and play that role really well.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):
I imagine the ultimate unlock is that combined with what is that person's personality style and what is the best way they receive information, which is a little harder. Because you can't force them to take some tests and you can't make them give you the results. But I know a lot of teams do these tests together as a team and share the results. And so it's I guess a reminder of just that's really powerful if you and your team, especially the execs at company.

Evan LaPointe (01:19:09):
Yeah, exactly. And when you move into this vulnerability out of your three choices state, we don't need a bunch of data for that to work really well. If you said, "Hey, I'm not super strong at this," and the rest of the room was like, well "Wait, this other person's super awesome at this, why don't not the two of you work together," then it's like under 30 seconds we've unlocked potential that wasn't there.

(01:19:34):
So you want to get business.... I kind of think of extending the video game metaphor. Not only are we choosing our characters or we are a certain character, but the business has a difficulty setting that we chose based on the habitat. And I've worked in and with way too many companies where we are playing the game in nightmare and every enemy takes a thousand shotgun shells to bring down instead of just switching the difficulty setting to easy, which is like the enemies somehow become our friends as we go through this journey.

(01:20:06):
I mean, it really can be that transformative, especially with a case like yours that you talked about. Okay, I am not as high in openness. I'm very high in conscientiousness. If I can admit this and ask different types of questions, everybody else in the room will be like the difficulty setting of this just went to zero and the speed of it just went to way higher than it used to be.

(01:20:32):
And we underestimate this kind of less concrete part of the business world. And I mean that's the genesis of this whole business that I was crazy enough to start after starting other companies in the past, which is like we are underestimating how much of our operational reality is a function of our human reality. And are we doing enough? Are we doing the right things to close the gap between what science knows and what business does? And do we even know what the science is? Have we educated ourselves to close the gap? And then it becomes super obvious, oh, this makes a lot of sense to be open and find the patch to my bug. And here we go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):
This fractal of topics continues to grow. I'm trying to contain it. There's three things I want to try to talk about in the rest of our chat, that stuff we've touched on that I think will be really useful to people. One is relationships. You mentioned there's more to talk about there just how to build great relationships. Two is I want to come back to the habitat and building a habitat that is very conducive to innovation and speed and success and those sorts of things. And then I want to talk about focus. We talked a bit about just how important focus is and how differently our brains operate in different states of focus. So maybe we start with the relationship piece just because that connects to what we were just talking about of how do we strengthen relationships, create better relationships within our teams.

Evan LaPointe (01:21:53):
Yeah, so we were talking about relationships kind of as this off ramp or this kind of sidecar to influence. And real quickly the fast mode of influence and relationships goes really well together. So we talked about the slow and the moderate. The fast mode of influence is cognitive dissonance. It's essentially saying in the moment, I'm not going to wait for you to experience anything. It's saying in the moment, how does this formula compute? Explain to me, Evan, how you being too blunt in feedback is going to end up in a human being changing. Why do you believe that?

(01:22:29):
And especially it's that second phrase of why do you believe that drill below the behavior down into the belief. What do you believe that has you doing this? And then we can explore how preposterous the belief itself is, which then bubbles up to the surface level of this.

(01:22:47):
And if in the environment, the habitat's a huge component of this as our relationships, which is if you have great relationships where people trust each other enough to have this kind of cognitive dissonance conversation, and we have a habitat that is very clear that we are free to discuss cognitive dissonance and logical disconnects, that is really important to do. Then you activate fast influence mode basically. So that's a really important thing. And then as you transition to relationships, well what are... The question that everybody kind of glosses over in my opinion is what is a relationship? I don't know how you feel about answering that question, but it's a really hard-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):
I would just go to ChatGPT. What is a relationship?

Evan LaPointe (01:23:33):
Exactly, right. Yeah. At this point we have some help that we didn't use to have. But the other thing that goes along with what is a relationship is how good is my relationship with person X? Like, you and I both know Shreyas and how good is our relationship? I would say it's awesome. Why is it awesome? I don't know. It just feels great. So let's double click on a good definition and a good framework because once you actually know why a relationship feels great, that example or why a relationship feels super difficult, now we can start to build some strategies, some actual action plans for them.

(01:24:14):
So what we propose to people is if you take that third component of your brain ability, that is one piece of your relationships, especially your professional relationships. So if you know an engineer and you have an idea of something you want to build and they have the ability to build it, their ability and their utility to you is a function of your relationship and it will contribute to the positive or negative force that you feel in that relationship. Like, wow, this person has a lot of ability. My appreciation is higher, my faith in them is higher, my cooperation with them is higher.

(01:24:50):
If you question a person's ability or they've proven that ability is kind of unreliable, those things start to kind of vector downwards and we will pick on Shreyas through this as a good example? Because I think most of the people watching also know him. What is his ability? What is his utility? As high as I've ever seen. I mean every conversation he's intellectually conceptually additive to. You're better after you've talked to him every time. At least that's been my experience with him.

(01:25:20):
And we all know people like that, with various fields and various abilities. So that's one piece that's really important. And why as an individual, it's so important to invest in your ability because it is so integral to every relationship you have, particularly professional relationships and your ability, knowledge, your reasoning, your imagination, your skill set, these are all incrementable facets of you.

(01:25:50):
And that's really, really key. Now here's the plot twist. Your ability is actually not the most important part of a relationship, biologically speaking. There's two more that matter quite a bit more. And the surprise ending is that the third one matters the most, which is scary in some cases.

(01:26:11):
The second factor of relationships is trust. So trust in the brain. If we go very primitive back to the amygdala that we talked about earlier, trust is simply risk. Human level risk and trust can span from strongly negative to strongly positive in a relationship. And we felt that full range with different people in our lives. Strongly negative trust is the brain saying, this person is dangerous to me. They're very likely to try to undermine me. They're very likely to not deliver something. Personal harm will occur by essentially kind of interacting in this relationship.

(01:26:51):
And then on the other side of trust, we kind of try to create some levels to this to keep it clean. And the fractal continues to grow a little bit, but we'll try to keep this simple. But I like to think of trust one, two and three. Three distinct levels of trust. And trust one is, let's say we're having a cookout. Trust one is Lenny, could you please bring the chips, ideally sealed, but it's a delegation of a simple non-critical task knowing that it is likely to get done and get done decently well. But it's not like this huge level of trust. It's the people that we work with where this type of delegation, and especially if people delegate under the thesis of "I want to do the high value work, so let me put the low value work on other people." That's all the low value work that we put on other people, and it allows us to purify our focus on the high value work, and we don't need all the low value work to go beautifully well or be artistically brilliant.

(01:27:53):
So trust two is when we step up to almost like "I need to do this myself. Is there anybody who could do it as well as me?" That there's no risk to me having them do it instead of me doing it. And that's where you get true scalability of teams. So if you can trust people enough, your brain's assessment of risk of giving this task to someone else or giving this knowledge even to somebody else, that they'll treat it the way you would treat it, is a significantly higher positive trust that you can feel in a relationship.

(01:28:26):
And then finally, trust three is when we do hit these breakpoints in our brain where we say the way your mind works is beyond the way my mind works on this topic. So the classic example at the cookout would be if Wolfgang Puck was a neighbor, we're going to have Wolfgang Puck do all the most critical stuff and maybe even set up the music and the decor and whatever. Or another example would be like when Steven Spielberg has John Williams score a film, he's not hoping John will do it as well as Steven would do it. He's saying, "Just send me the bill. Try not to go too crazy." But he is not going to sit down with the invoice and be like, "Why did you need 13 horns instead of 11?" John just gets to do what John does because there's so much trust in this kind of beyond my event horizon kind of risk. It would be riskier for me to do it than for him to do it or her to do it, right?

(01:29:25):
So that's kind of the level, but that matters more to a human being because the safety system, if it activates, your utility is sunk. So if you're an awesome engineer but you damage people, it doesn't matter that you're an awesome engineer because in the social network, the mesh of your organization, you are a node that has a protective covering around it. Information is not flowing to you the way it would normally, and delegation is not flowing to you and access is not flowing to you the way it would normally. So you are a kind of protected, deactivated, sequestered node of the mesh at this point in time. And a lot of people really don't get that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):
Yeah, that's a really good way of visualizing.

Evan LaPointe (01:30:16):
And then here's the surprise ending. The last piece of every relationship that you have is appeal. Appeal is how your brain interprets the shared experiences you have with other people. Whether or not you look forward to being around that person, whether or not you like their style, the feel of what shared experiences really are. And if you think about, let's pick on Shreyas one last time. What is his ability and utility? Off the charts. To what extent can he be trusted? Trust three, off the charts. Will he ever damage somebody? I mean, not to my knowledge. He may have some really dark past that we don't know about, but as far as I've seen, not a lot of damage in his wake. And then thirdly, what kind of experience is he? He's an extraordinarily positive experience. So he naturally accumulates great relationship after great relationship after great relationship.

(01:31:15):
And again, if you're that great engineer with a ton of ability, now let's flip the middle dimension. And we trust you a lot, but you're a horrible experience. Are you coming to our offsite? Are you in this meeting? No, you're gone. We don't want you there. You're like a hurricane. So biologically speaking, the biggest bug in our programming as we transfer this to the business context is what makes the most sense in business is the most, if it's a meritocracy, the best people with the best knowledge that we can trust should be in the room and we will fight it with every fiber of our being if they're a terrible experience. And that's a bummer. And what's funny is you can flip it. We all either have friends or know people who have friends that you cannot trust, they have no ability to speak of, but they're a super awesome experience. What a great friend.

(01:32:16):
So how is it that we get this thing completely flipped? And I think that's the thing. As you parse that list, as anybody listening parses that list, it's critical to ask what kind of experience am I? That is where to start? Not how good am I at my job? How much do I know? How critical am I to this process? But am I a miserable experience? And if the answer is yes, don't worry too much about the other pieces yet, you got to fix that first.

(01:32:48):
And to this point of the profile, as you parse the profile, you'll find things like obviously not a pleasant experience, like being really impolite, obviously not a pleasant experience, being super overbearing and assertive, obviously not a pleasant experience, being hyper low in openness and enacting out of that and telling everybody they're overcomplicating everything all the time. Not a great experience for people who are actually well-intentioned trying to get it right. So there's concrete things that you can do with this knowledge in mind.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:16):
This last piece makes me think about why some of the most effective PMs are the PMs that bring a lot of energy and positivity to the team and just get people excited, which is such a soft skill, but such a powerful thing you can do for your team because people kind of look to you to lead them. I had a PM I was working with in every meeting, he is like, "This is going to be awesome." He just comes right in every meeting, "Oh, who's ready to make some decisions," and it really changes everything. And so this is amazing advice.

(01:33:46):
So basically if you want better relationships, which will make you a better influencer, start with what kind of experience am I, when people work with me, ask me for stuff, ask me questions, and you shared a bunch of specific things you can do.

(01:34:03):
Something I always tell people is just try to smile, just look happy. That makes a big difference.

Evan LaPointe (01:34:07):
Look happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:10):
Bring energy, look happy. Just try to be excited. Yeah, so if you want to build better relationships which have all these amazing trickle down effects, your advice is think about the experience you are to other people when they work with you, work on trust and ideally get to the place that third level of you are doing it better than them. But that's a high bar for all things. And then the last thing is, are you actually amazing? Work in your abilities, that's kind of the last piece.

Evan LaPointe (01:34:38):
Yeah, exactly. And it's not that none of these become unimportant because the other are kind of the gateways. I mean your relationships require all three, especially your professional relationships. So yeah, it's more just like if experience is the only thing undermining you when you're otherwise very trustworthy and very skilled and able, that's a shame. Just fix it.

(01:35:03):
And there's a whole bunch of ways to go about that. But I like to leave that to people to explore that creatively. Like well, "Oh gosh, okay, I can change this to this to this." On the trust thing, do you hurt people? I mean, that's it. Do people have a reason to believe that you are risky or dangerous? And unfortunately in a lot of habitats, the habitat itself either allows or even rewards people that are super untrustworthy to play the system in advance of the system. And as you talk to Jeffrey about the power conversation, the worse the habitat, the more his suggestions work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
I could see that.

Evan LaPointe (01:35:49):
And the reason that he's correct, he used the phrase, "This is how the world always has been, is how it is, and it's how it always will be." Well, it's how the normal dysfunctional world always has been, is and will be. And if you want people in your organization to rise on merit and for influence to work to generate better decision-making, make better products, have a better company, move faster, et cetera, you need to create a habitat where what Jeffrey's observed about the normal dysfunctional world largely doesn't work within your habitat. So if it's effective for people to harm each other in your habitat, you are performing at a much lower level than if harming each other was extremely ineffective. And that's up to you as a leader, as a manager, et cetera. And then of course, skill is what it is. It's your ability to convert your intents into outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):
I'm glad you're talking about habitat, that's exactly where I wanted to go. So just two more things I want to spend our time on, habitat and focus, how to create more space for focus and get better focus. So you've touched on this many times at this point, this idea of a habitat. I think another way to think about this is the culture of your company. Is that right?

Evan LaPointe (01:37:06):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:37:06):
Okay, cool. So are there a few things you could recommend to people to create a habitat that is conducive of good stuff?

Evan LaPointe (01:37:15):
Let's start at the start here. So in the difference between what science knows and business does, let's kind of zero in on the fact that the way most companies approach culture has a very shaky track record. Like if mission, vision, values was an airline, you would not allow any family to fly on that airline. It does not arrive at most of its intended destinations. That is just a super important starting point because I'm going to kill a sacred cow here while we talk about this. And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm trying to be mean or anything. It's just it's worth looking at stuff that doesn't work and wondering if there's something that could work a lot better. So if we look at habitat and culture, it's really about what people believe. It's what people believe is acceptable, permissible, productive, and the biggest flaw in people's approach to culture. And interestingly enough, even at YC, they talk about this mission, vision, values, culture, stuff that comes later, let some stuff happen with the business that comes later. They're right to say that if that's the paradigm you're going to use because it's not going to work either way. So you might as well do it later.

(01:38:31):
But if you're going to do it the right way and investigate human beliefs, and we talked about priming for example, culture is just the macro priming of the entire business of what your central belief systems are and then the permission that forms from those belief systems. So if you've done that really well, you should do that right at the very beginning. In what way should we approach this company, building this, working together, et cetera? That would be really, really helpful to get right from day one. And the belief system that people have, there are two approaches to changing people's beliefs.

(01:39:10):
Mission, vision, values is what we call a performative approach. Meaning I'm going to come up with some expression of an inspiring mission, inspiring values and inspiring vision, and it's going to be performed well enough. It's going to be like if we were busking in the park, this is going to be a cool enough mission, vision, values that people throw some change into my guitar case and they buy into it, they gather around. And I think that's just completely the wrong approach because we're hoping to inspire people. We're hoping to be artistically talented enough to pull that off. The other approach is to be deductive, logically deductive, which is centrally speaking. There is hopefully a market out there that's glad our company exists, who is glad we exist, why are they glad we exist? And that's shifting our mission into something that we call your role, the role you play in the world around you.

(01:40:08):
Who is glad you exist? Why are they glad you exist? And that is a fact. That is not an inspiring idea. That is like, okay, we work with this company that does AI-based optical character recognition, document ingestion, et cetera. Why is the world glad that they exist? Well, because we get 95% of the documents scanned into structured data that normally people have to transfer by hand. That's pretty compelling. Why is the world glad Warby Parker exists? Because before you used to choose between looking dumb and it being cheap and looking cool and it being expensive, and now you can look cool and it's cheap. The world's really glad we exist.

(01:40:50):
Now that's true. I don't need you to be inspired to believe that that is true. And now everything that we're going to think about for the rest of our beliefs, we're going to deduce from that. So we're just going to use logic to build our culture, not inspiration. So this next thing we need to figure out is how can we understand the specific value that's created when we play this role in the world? We save people money, we save people time, we open up markets, we help people explore possibilities and potential they couldn't tap into otherwise, etc.

(01:41:21):
So what's the role of Core? People are glad we exist because we tap into potential they had no access to before. And at the team level, at the company level, that could be a really big deal. So we know that and we say, "Okay, well gosh, that implies so much." There's so much we got to do now what value does that produce? And then I could say, okay, once we understand the definition of value, which comes out of our role, now we can change the definition of done. So a lot of teams talk about bias to action. And hamsters have bias to action. They get up out of their straw and they turn that wheel as hard as they possibly can and they go absolutely nowhere. But if you understand the role you play-

Evan LaPointe (01:42:01):
But if you understand the role you play in the world, and you understand the value you produce in terms of time savings, cost savings, upside, whatever it is that you do, then you can say, "We should have a bias to impact, not a bias to action. We shouldn't just do stuff, we should have an effect that has the result of value creation. We should save people time." And now when you're a product team, looking at this, and you're saying, "Well, here's a cool new idea, Lenny, let's do this." You can now use that as a habitat level permission to be like, "Oh, how does that produce value for people? How does that make people go faster, save time, get smarter, do something they couldn't do otherwise?" And then you can still use that exact same vocabulary when you go sell it to them, "This is how it makes you faster, smarter, more efficient, save cost."

(01:42:50):
So it's like really logical deduction. And if people think that we should do something, build a product that doesn't create value. Now instead of being inspiring, we can be logical. We don't build things that produce no value, that is not a priority until we can turn it into something that does produce value. So you're turning culture into something highly usable, in getting away from performative culture into logical deductive culture. And I think that's really, really the key for most people is to say, "Let's understand why the world's glad we exist." That's why we have a team, that's why we have customers. And what does that imply about our standards for ourselves when we execute in value creation? Even down to the email. If I send some wonky email reply to somebody's question and it doesn't produce value for them, I'm not done. I need to finish the job until it produces value for them.

(01:43:43):
Quality standards are baked into this, that again is implied. Would I be happy that Warby Parker exists, if they shipped me something that's a two out of 10 in quality? No. So we can't make things that are two out of 10. And everybody has a belief. There are plenty of people that probably interview at Warby Parker that think, two out of 10 is perfectly fine, just get it to them. And no, we need an antibody to that belief. We have decision-making intelligence, which everybody believes we should go fast, break stuff, or we should be super slow, and get everything right and wherever in between. That's a fun one to talk about. And then finally, you have a teaming dynamic belief, which is essentially every single human's belief of what is acceptable treatment of other human beings. What state does that put the other human in?

(01:44:35):
And a lot of people, particularly like I'll pick on myself with the low politeness, will spend years thinking, "I'm giving honest feedback quickly. This is efficient." And you're like, "How is it efficient when it takes people six months instead of six minutes to act on your feedback because they just don't like you so much, and you have this appeal problem that keeps you out of all the rooms?" Actually your utility, which, your politeness is a utility transferred mechanism, but we don't want you in the room. So you're not a business benefit in this case. So that's kind of the starting point. That's ground zero of habitat is do not build an habitat on the roots of inspiration. It doesn't work. It can work, right? If you do it super inspiring stuff and you're super inspiring people, then you probably have the artistic ability to pull that off. But even then, you'd still be better off if you would do it through logical deduction instead of inspiration.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:36):
Say someone is like, "Okay, I'm going to improve my habitat, I'm going to improve my company culture. Or I'm just going to start setting up a good habitat." What's something they can do? What can they do today, this week, to just start to do that? Is it, sit down and think about what is the value we provide? Why do we exist? Is there something else you'd recommend?

Evan LaPointe (01:45:54):
So the brain craves an answer to the question, why am I doing this? And not only are there things we should start doing, but I like to deepen the commitment in people's minds to what we should start doing, by thinking of it as, we should start doing things that we've been negligent in doing, right? Not just, oh, this would be even better, but we are actually causing some habitat problems by being negligent in certain things. So the primary thing that people are negligent in is answering the question, why should I do this, to their team. And saying, you should do this because it's your job is a form of negligence, right? You're not actually answering that question in any useful way. Because I could also answer that in the safety way, which I sort of just did by saying, it's your job. I'm implying that there's a consequence. But I could be like, because if you don't, here's the specific bad things that will happen.

(01:46:52):
You could be giving them a why in terms of reward, because, oh, if you do this, you get this, or if we do this, we get this. But you could also be giving them a purposeful answer to why, which is not a form of negligence, which is to say, because our work actually matters. There are people out there waiting on us to ship this product to improve their situation, and they also want us to get it right at the same time. So bias to impact through that lens. We do need to ship this. It needs to happen, and it needs to be right, or at least right enough in its first version.

(01:47:28):
So if you have been negligent, and we all have at times, right? I'm not trying to judge, but I'm trying to convict, right? To build some conviction, to build some commitment. If you have been negligent in answering to all these minds that work with you, why we're even doing this. That's the starting point, is make sure everybody knows why. And that why is a shared why across the team. And not just the Simon Sinek big picture why? I mean, very specific why. That for my team, when we build training materials, when we look at it through that lens of, if we get this right, this is what happens to teams, and companies, and products and their customers.

(01:48:12):
There's a through line at the big deal and that's why we can't do it this way, or that's why we should get more obsessed with quality, and why we should get more interdependent as a team and stop doing things that are just our own ideas. But say, "Hey Lenny, I'm thinking about doing it this way. Is there anything you'd add before I hit go?" And then you'd be like, "Oh, I think it would be 10% better if you did it this way." And then now our product is 10% better. So that's kind of the square one is ask yourself, when's the last time our team had a conversation about why we're even doing any of this? What value it produces? Who is affected by our decisions? And if that hasn't happened in a while, that's not good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:57):
Is another way to think about this, your mission, is that a term?

Evan LaPointe (01:49:02):
Yeah, I think it's an alternative to mission, I try... And I don't want to stomp all over mission, vision, values because I think they can work. But I think it's easier for people to conceptualize the importance of their work, if they understand, we are playing a role, not fulfilling a mission. And role implies obligation. There's no obligation in mission, unless you feel the inspiration so powerfully. And these differences are subtle, but neurologically, it's different. If I tell your brain, "Here are the people counting on you to get this right, Lenny." Your brain activates a region called the anterior insular cortex, which starts to think about other people in the context of the solution you're creating.

(01:49:45):
And if I say, "We are here to change people's lives through this," in a more general sense, your prefrontal cortex will still activate to solve the problem, but your anterior insular cortex will not, to more deeply consider the humans affected by the problem. So you're kind of adding to the toolkit of what the brain will bring to the table to generate solutions. And if you activate more good regions of the brain, you get better solutions. So I lean into this. Personally, I'm like, "You really don't need a mission statement. You need to understand the role you play, and people need to have some response, some physiological, like, 'I get it, to my actions impact people.'" And if they don't have a response, you should go find a human who does, for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:35):
One last thread I want to follow, focus. You have some really cool advice on how to help. And this just comes from everybody wants to get better focus. Everyone wants their team to have more time for focus. Everyone wants their engineers to sit there and build things faster, their designers to get stuff done. And it all comes from getting really good at focus and creating space for focus on your team. What advice do you have for folks that want to personally learn to focus better, and to help their team have more time for focus, get stuff done essentially?

Evan LaPointe (01:51:10):
I mean, isn't this the question? Because this is where it all ends, right? First things first, let's look at the neuroscience that we have available to us. Which is, the study of focus either is or is tightly associated with the study of what's called brain waves. That's becoming a lot more popular. We're seeing it even in athletes, like professional golfers, or studying how their brain waves are focused on the golf shot and which mode to put the brain into to play golf at the highest level. Same thing applies to work. There's a bunch of different kind of bands of brain waves. Most of them actually are when you're asleep. So your REM cycles, your deep sleep cycles, your kind of drowsy cycles, those are brain waves. You can feel your brain turning off, you can feel your brain turning on when you dream. But when you're awake, there's really three primary modes that your brain is in.

(01:52:03):
The nerdy side of this, kind of the nerdy language is alpha, beta and gamma. Those are the distinct ranges of brain activity, and they basically represent how focused your brain is. So alpha is quite simply daydreaming. So your brain is very quiet and empty. Easy metaphor is if you're in your house at night and everything's quiet, you hear things that you don't hear during the daytime, and that's what alpha is like in the brain. Your brain is actually working subconsciously a lot. But when you're busy, which is beta, your brain is too noisy to hear any of those little creaks and pops in the house. But when you're in alpha, you hear stuff.

(01:52:41):
So the most common setting for alpha for most people is the shower. So it unlocks this mystery of like, why do I have all these ideas in the shower? Well, it's because your brain is in alpha. It hears these little creaks and pops inside of the attic, and it unpacks them. He goes, "Oh, that's an interesting idea," it comes out of nowhere. It can be driving, gardening, car washing, cycling, whatever. As long as there's not too much cognitive load, then you can be daydreaming. And I'll come back to this in a second because there's a big permission problem at the habitat level for some of these focus levels.

(01:53:14):
Beta is productivity mode. So if you've ever seen somebody with a poster on their back wall that says, "Get shit done," that's basically just a poster that says beta on it. I love beta. And answer emails, have meetings, write code. And there are some gamma code, deeper thinking scenarios where you're writing code, delivering presentations, making presentations. So much of our workday is beta, and it's just... I mean, some of us have an infinite amount of demand for beta work. There's just a never ending stream of stuff we could do and get done.

(01:53:55):
And then gamma is your brain's intense focus. So if you're learning something really complicated, you're learning thermodynamics in college or something like that, and you're just like, "Wow, this is not easy." And you have to really push your brain to grapple with these concepts, connect the dots, even remember certain things, that's gamma. And we feel that sometimes at work, that here's a problem, a complex issue that we could tackle in beta by slapping duct tape on it, or we could tackle in gamma by reverse engineering, and going deep. And that's where we start to connect the dots that we talked about earlier, that focus and reverse engineering are related. That in beta, you have no intention to learn anything new to get something done, to think more deeply to get something done, to reconsider an existing process, or structure, or framework in your mind to get something done, you're going to utilize those things to get something done.

(01:54:52):
Gamma is where we go, "I would normally do it this way. I can see why that's not the right way. I need to make something new. I need to break my framework and build a brand new one right now to do something." So we generally spend too much time in beta in work, and that's both a judgment call, because I certainly have my own opinion about beta. I call it the conscientiousness crisis, which is conscientiousness wants beta, openness wants gamma. I'm kind of thinking of tying these pieces together. And it's not that conscientiousness is inherently a crisis, but when you meet teams that haven't done any innovation, haven't rethought the market, have become insensitive to changes in the environment around them, have become insensitive to their own employee problems and are still just kind of like this locomotive that keeps on going, irrespective of what's going on around it. It's that heads-down form of conscientious beta, that feels like, "Now's not the time, let's stay focused, let's stay focused," et cetera.

(01:55:53):
So we don't want to get rid of beta, we got a lot of work to do. But let's put a rule of thumb out there for people to explore, because it's going to be subjective to every team and every company. But as a rule of thumb, if 25% of your year is spent in gamma and alpha, you're probably a lot better off than the teams who spend less than 25% of their year thinking deep, and being in this more daydreaming mode. So what I wanted to circle back on is, how could we possibly daydream productively? Well, that's preposterous. And this is where you can build in your mind... And I do have another PDF for this, if people want to see it.

(01:56:32):
But you can build in your mind a 3 x 3 grid where we have the safety system, reward, and purpose system in columns. We have alpha, beta and gamma in rows, and we basically have a list of nine channels that the brain can activate to generate different types of thinking. And most of the companies out there, most of the teams out there, are primarily, all their programming comes from safety beta and reward beta. How can I be busy to get rewards, ROI, customers, deals, whatever? Even promotions, more self-centered kind of rewards? And beta safety, which would be, how can I be busy? Optics, manage my reputation, avoid risk, that sort of stuff?

(01:57:19):
The crisis is basically realizing, spending too much time in those two out of our nine available boxes, is probably not generating anywhere near the ideal outcomes. And if we could instead shift to the purposeful column by answering that brain's craving for why, with an answer that explains, it's not about you, it's not about us, it's about other people are counting on us to get this stuff right, does that matter to you? Because for most people, they're like, "Yeah, that's actually really cool. I can have an impact on real stuff happening in other people's lives and in the world outside of me?" So that that activates, now all of a sudden we can say, okay, let's look at alpha across the top row.

(01:58:06):
Alpha safety is when you get in the shower, and all of your anxieties, worries, et cetera, come out of nowhere, out of the attic of your mind. What happens in alpha reward? It's when you have these breakthroughs of how to get a deal, how to win something. It's daydreaming, but your brain is primed to daydream in a certain way, whether it's about anxiety or anger, or whether it's about rewards you care about. If it's purpose, this is where from a vision perspective, a possibilities product perspective, you're going to have all sorts of crazy cool ideas pop into your mind if you've primed your brain to being purposeful and then you daydream.

(01:58:44):
And you can do this in the middle of a day. Certain companies, it's easier than others. But if you can push away from your desk, and just go sit in a park or something for 10 minutes, 20 minutes and calm your brain down, listen, something cool will probably happen in your brain. I can't guarantee that, but you have to experiment with it to find out how it works for you. And then the same thing for gamma, when you hear phrases like, "We can't talk about this for the rest of our lives," that is the gamma prevention team kicking the door down and saying, "We're here to get you back into beta. Everybody, put your hands behind your backs," sort of a thing.

(01:59:22):
And that's where the habitat and the focus kind of matters because you will not ever get a gamma idea from a beta mind. You will never get an alpha idea from a beta mind. So if your business needs some breakthrough, daydreaming, interesting ideas in order to create adjacencies to build new products, to seek new markets, to better fulfill the role you're playing within this market, then team has to have permission to enter that intellectual focused state, or that you're turning that channel off. You're taking that off of the programming available through your particular subscription.

(02:00:04):
And the same thing applies to gamma. The habitat basically needs to establish that gamma is a viable channel for a lot of work, and there's permission to go into it. You can certainly overdo it. That's why I say 25%, you don't need to spend half of your year, three-quarters of your year in gamma. It bonkers how smart you can be if you spend three or four hours in an afternoon in that deep-focused state, you'll just do stuff you'd never do. And if you can get the team to have off-sites that are gamma-focused, everybody's scatter and be alone, and do this stuff that are gamma and alpha-focused, that are productive and you bring ideas back. You're just simply going to generate thinking and outcomes that you wouldn't otherwise. And it may be that 10 percent's right for you. It may be that 30 percent's right for you, depending on how dynamic your market and customer base are. But just to challenge yourself with the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:00:58):
This stuff is so fascinating, I wish we had another hour just to dig deep into this. Because it feels like just this alone is going to really transform the way companies operate. So let's try to give people something tactical they can do to create more space for alpha and gamma waves. And essentially your advice is, a fourth of your time should be spent, if possible, in alpha and gamma time. Is that right?

Evan LaPointe (02:01:22):
Yeah, I think that probably is overabundance, in all honesty. But if you think about it through the lens of a quarter, if you're going to be on a set of cadences, and this is probably the tactical advice. It's like, look at your cadences and say, at the quarter level, that's probably the right level of fidelity for most people to look at their calendars in terms of what big stuff should we be doing? Because six months is usually too long to do anything big. Too much has happened in the world. Year is definitely too long to wait for a cadence to kind of kick in. So quarterly is really good. And what's nice is when we cluster our gamma time on this quarterly cadence, we can take a lot of the stuff that would be what we call calendar invaders, these random conversations that come up out of nowhere. And we can be like, "Well, we're getting ready to have an offsite, this quarter's offsite in two weeks. Can this idea wait until then to be processed?"

(02:02:16):
So you kind of get this nice little black hole effect, where a lot of distractions have a new home, because you've actually said, "We're going to distinctly do stuff." You're saying, "Yes, but not now," to a lot of distractions. But yeah, I think that's the ideal cadence. And that, for some teams, it needs to be maybe a half a day or a full day. You'll figure it out based on your own business. But what per quarter is a necessary amount of time for us to break beta and go into deep thinking analysis mode? How healthy is our operation? How smart are we being? Are we delivering value? What needs to be reevaluated from the market's experience, the customer's experience, the team's experience? Let's look at these different views of the business, and make some prioritized decisions about, we're going to make specific improvements this quarter for these areas.

(02:03:10):
And then even once a week, maybe just find half a day if you can, maybe, but maybe less than half a day, couple hours to be in gamma, once a week. And you'll kind of feel it out from there. But the reason the rule of thumb of 25 is out there is 25 is kind of the risk point. Because most people will be like, "We're not even spending 5%." Or the perfectionist team might be like, "We're 50." So if you're far away from that rule of thumb, that's a pretty good indicator it's a good time to audit yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:03:42):
When you hear the term, deep work, is that generally referring to gamma time?

Evan LaPointe (02:03:47):
Yeah, people can use that term in a couple of ways. I think a lot of people call deep work, don't bother me beta, which could be one. And other teams might call gamma deep work, but that's probably more appropriate. I think, don't bother me beta is for some teams, they need to be told, "No, no, use this time not just to not be interrupted, but to think differently about problems. To think about is the architecture even right? Is the way we are thinking about this even right?" Not just get a lot of stuff done.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:04:18):
Yeah. So it's not just sitting in your email and write documents, it's actually try to think about bigger problems, things that are challenging your brain, not just like, "I'm just productive getting stuff done, getting stuff done." Awesome. Something that worked really well for me, similar to what you just recommended is having, I had two blocks of time during the week that were two hours or three hours long, where it's just, "Don't bother me, deep work time." So I had it I think Wednesday morning and Friday morning for two or three hours. And actually in the calendars, if you book something during this time, I'll slap you. And that worked really well. And nobody complained.

(02:04:54):
We covered a lot. Here's the things we've covered. I was just taking notes and all the advice that you've shared, how to help people run better meetings, how to get better at developing vision for their team, and company, and product, how to be a better influencer. How to build better relationships, how to create a better culture for your company, how to create more focus and more productive focus. That's a lot. I'm very proud of our conversation. Before we get to a very short lightning round, because we've gone pretty long, I want to keep it short.

Evan LaPointe (02:05:22):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:05:22):
Is there anything else you want to share, leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we close-

Evan LaPointe (02:05:28):
No, I don't think we need... I mean, there's certainly a lot more that we could talk about, but I think we don't want to melt any minds. So we want people to kind of walk away and be like, "I can do that, I can do that, I can do that." So definitely pick two or three wins. I kind of call them pots of ocean to boil instead of oceans to boil. So get a few pots of ocean to boil first, and focus on that for sure. And definitely make one of those pots, if it's a problem area for you, what kind of experience you are. I mean, that's central to everything. Everything else works better in the whole system once you've boiled that pot of the ocean, and then things get easier.

(02:06:05):
And then I guess the only last thing I would add is, think of everything we've talked today. It might help to put some language to it as floor risers and ceiling risers. Because your company has a horizon of performance that you're heading into, and there's a bottom end of that range and a top end of that range. So as you get better at meetings, not only are you increasing... You're raising the floor to get rid of bad meetings and waste, and you might be saving a ton of time or converting useless time into useful time, but you also might be raising the ceiling.

(02:06:35):
And I would be really specific with yourself and your team about, which outcome are you chasing? Is it both? Is it one or the other? And say, we're actually trying to raise the floor so that our performance never goes below a certain range. We get faster, smarter as a result, fewer mistakes. Or are we actually trying to uncap a ceiling that we're dealing with right now, especially around things like strategy and vision? If we feel that those conversations always end up feeling like inconceivable arguments, we have a ceiling on our business's performance. As a result of that, can we raise that ceiling and explore a higher horizon of performance for the business?

Lenny Rachitsky (02:07:12):
Amazing. Evan, with that, we've reached our very exciting and very quick lightning round. Are you ready?

Evan LaPointe (02:07:18):
Yes, let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:07:20):
All right, so let's start with what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Evan LaPointe (02:07:26):
Well, the obvious first one is Never Split the Difference. I recommend that book to everybody in the universe. I think if you haven't read it yet, you shouldn't get your driver's license. For those who don't know, it was written by Chris Voss, he was an FBI hostage negotiator. And it explores how to negotiate with people, and not just hostages, but your colleagues, your parents, your wife, like everybody. And there's some very surprising technique in there that is unexpected, not trying to get people to agree with you, but getting them to say no, more often. Instead of saying, "Hey, Lenny, are you willing to do this?" Say, "Hey, Lenny, are you opposed to doing this?" And it's just this reversal. And "I'm giving you the out," is the way he explains it. There's a whole bunch of other technique, but the more of that technique is in a team, the better. The better the team does. That's a no-brainer.

(02:08:16):
The second one I would say, since we've kind of covered this topic a little bit about habitat today. If you enjoy reading books that are sort of root canals, but you're better off because you read them, there's a book called Never... not Never Split the Difference, there's a book called The Person and the Situation. It was written by some researchers, some psychological researchers. And what it explores is the difference between how personality influences your behavior, and how the situation you're in, or like we talked about, the habitat you're in, influences your behavior. And if you're not yet convinced that either of those matters, like, "Oh, it doesn't. I'll do what I do regardless of the habitat, or I'll do what I do regardless of who I am," that book will melt the face off of that existing mental model conclusively. It's really valuable knowledge to understand the mechanics of how the situation influences a person, and how the personality influences the person.

(02:09:12):
And then I guess the last, maybe we'll put a fork in the road of a choose your own adventure. If you're a real student of the game, and you want go 10,000 leagues under the sea on this stuff, there's a series of books called the Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience. You can find it on Amazon. A lot of them, you can just get on your Kindle for a lot cheaper than the library-decorating version of it, but that is bonkers. It talks about how your brain applies to intelligence, emotionality, relationships. It's incredible knowledge. If you instead want to keep it more in the part of the world you experience and can see and not the brain. Thaler wrote a book called Misbehaving. It was kind of the major book about behavioral economics.

(02:09:58):
And again, we spend a lot of time in companies talking about the way people should act, instead of the way people do act. And behavioral economics is essentially the version of economics that's about how people do act, not how people should act. So I think that's a great field of study. And then again, Robert Greene's whole library is super valuable, especially Human Nature, if you're into that. He's a little darker of an author, certainly kind of doesn't pull punches about human nature. So those are all great books to explore.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:10:28):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Evan LaPointe (02:10:31):
I look more at the category level of products. I really like products that have great ergonomics. A lot of people underestimate the value of what it feels like to use the product. Are things in the right place at the right time? I just started this newsletter that's kind of like, how do you break all of what we do in a bite-sized pieces for people who are super interested in this stuff to get something weekly? And it exposed me to Beehiiv, which is a very well-designed newsletter platform, high ergonomics. I don't ever find anything hard to find. I can get things to work the way I want them to work.

(02:11:07):
So just, I like that example. And I remember even back to when I was obsessed with finding the perfect backpack to travel with, and then you find these brands where you're going through security, and you didn't even know it, but there's a pocket designed for your phone in exactly the place you would want the pocket for your phone to be. And you're just like, "That's so great. I love that this team designed this pocket just in the right spot." So that's really my focus is ergonomics in product.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:11:32):
Final question. I saw you tweeted that people are telling you that you look like JD Vance, which is hilarious. Do you think this will be a net benefit or a net hurdle?

Evan LaPointe (02:11:42):
It'll be an incredible benefit to Halloween, because it's totally clear what I'm going to do for Halloween. Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm going to have to see what people in the street... Fortunately I live in Park City, so I don't run across a lot of people in the street who want to yell at people. But if I lived in Chicago or something like that, I would've no doubt somebody would come up and throw something at me. But yeah, I'm neutral on the topic so far, minus the Halloween bonus.

Lenny Rachitsky (02:12:09):
We'll see. We'll see how your life changes. Evan, this has been amazing. There's so much richness to this conversation. And like I said, we've covered basically everything people want to get better at as product manager, you could say. Two final questions. Where can folks find the stuff that you do to dig deeper, to learn more, to learn more deeply from you? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Evan LaPointe (02:12:31):
Yeah, I mean, they can certainly find a lot of the stuff we do on our website, core-sciences.com. Find a link to that profile you talked about on there, which can be super fun to take and insightful. The newsletter, all the stuff that we do, you can kind of find out there. And then certainly Twitter. I mean, I've always been really prickly about people that get on Twitter to post only and not to interact. I'm kind of the opposite. I really love people's questions and pushback. And just yesterday, I probably spent way longer than I should have out of my portfolio management approach to time, just on a thread where I was talking to this really interesting woman about this debate almost, about the probability of people doing things based on their beliefs, which was... And then we had some kind of bystanders watching the whole thing happen, and I had a meeting with a good friend Rod afterwards, where we talked about how that all went.

(02:13:28):
So I love to talk to people and answer questions, and I'm sure people will have plenty of questions that they'd love to dive deeper into. So I'm on Twitter for sure. And then how you can help me. I mean, fortunately for me, I'm in the business of helping other people, whether those are individuals, teams, companies. So the most helpful thing to me is you helping yourself. So if you find our content valuable, if you want to have awesome managers or anything like that in this sort of science-based, kind of more efficient approach to getting there would be interesting, then reach out. We don't bite. We're pretty easy to work with. And that would be super fun to have a conversation about what your team needs.

(00:03:26):
All right. First up, we've got Katie Dill, who is head of design at Stripe and former head of design at Airbnb and Lyft sharing this amazing story of how the entire design team at Airbnb basically rebelled against her soon after she joined and what she learned from that experience.

Katie Dill (00:03:42):
I'm happy to talk about it because frankly, it was the biggest learning experience of my leadership career, or at least that happened in one moment, and it happened in my early days at Airbnb. So I was hired to take on the experience design organization, that's basically the product design team, which was 10 people at the time.

(00:04:02):
And so they had been reporting directly to one of the founders and they were going to start reporting to me. And during my interview process, I learned a lot about what was working and what wasn't working and some of the trials and tribulations with the design organization and its collaboration with others. So it seemed like there was room for improvement in how engineering and product management and design all work together. And there was also really low engagement scores in the design team.

(00:04:29):
And so I came in ready to go and excited to try to help make some change based on all the things that I had learned from various leaders and people across the company. And I came in swinging ready to go, and then about a month into my time there, I got a meeting on my calendar. Thursday 8:30 AM, was an hour and a half with half of the design team, so that was five people, and our HR partner.

Lenny (00:05:00):
Oh, no. That's never a good sign.

Katie Dill (00:05:01):
Usually it's [inaudible 00:05:01]. Yeah. And I remember this so vividly. I remember walking into the office and all the rooms in Airbnb's office are very unique spaces that look like Airbnbs, but of course this was the one room with all white walls and just a gray flat rectangle table. And I walked into the room and there were five of them seated around the table and they had a pack of papers in front of them, and they went on taking turns quietly reading from the papers all the things that they saw that I was doing wrong and all the things that they didn't like about me. And it was a really hard moment there. I went through all the usual stages of grief when one hears feedback, which is just immediate want to respond to be like, "Oh, well there was a good reason for that." And, "That's not how it actually was," and, "This is why I did that."

(00:05:59):
But luckily I had, thank goodness, I had the sense to just listen and not respond in that way. Clearly, what they were telling me is that that was one of the things that was missing. And so I heard them out and took it all in. And regardless of each individual thing, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me. They had no idea that they could trust in what I was trying to build and what I was trying to shape and that I cared about them and that I had their best interest and shared goals at heart. And that was absolutely my fault.

(00:06:45):
And in retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that.

(00:06:57):
And so it was an extremely valuable learning experience and I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them. And so I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me. You can inflict change on people, but if you want to do it with them, really trust is the key element there.

(00:07:37):
And then a couple of months later, we had the best engagement scores in the company. So it actually, it did objectively improve the situation and since then taken that on into next steps in other companies that I've joined and just think about instead of coming in swinging, come in listening, so that you can really set out to make change that actually has true positive impact on the folks around you and you bring along with you.

Lenny (00:08:04):
Next up, Paul Adams, chief product Officer at Intercom, sharing the nightmare experience of freezing on stage in front of thousands of people, having to walk off stage, and then people hearing him curse because the mic was still on, and then how he recovered. Plus a few stories of building some of Google's most infamous product failures.

Paul Adams (00:08:24):
Some things have happened in work, are very memorable at the time and they don't really scar you. This goes in the book that have scarred for life. Yeah, let's go long story short, I was at Facebook just over a decade ago, loved it at the time. I think it was a great place to be at the time. And basically San Francisco, I did a lot of talks for Facebook internally and externally. Facebook had a keynote slot, always have a keynote slot at Cannes, the world's biggest advertising festival. And the year prior, Zuck had been interviewed. He was the speaker, he'd been interviewed, gotten a hard time on privacy. It didn't go well, as well as they'd hoped.

(00:09:00):
So the next year they asked me to do it, maybe it was the Irish accent that made the offer come my way. And yeah, I got out into front the stage of the world's biggest advertising stage, and I'd say I was like three or four minutes into the talk, a talk I'd given, a very similar talk that I'd given lots of times.

(00:09:19):
And I just froze. I couldn't remember what I was supposed to say. It was the first ever time in my life I'd rehearsed a talk word for word. Usually, I have talking points and I'd ad lib and things get mixed around and it's kind of informal. This was media trained, do not say the wrong thing kind of talk. And I just could not remember what to say. I had some version of a panic attack, walked off stage, I was still mic'd up, cursed. I was laughing. I was like, "Geez, are they laughing at me. Oh my God, this is..." But I can manage to turn it around, I walked back out, I'd kind of been disarmed internally in my head, and the rest of it went well. And I was famous that night out in Cannes afterwards on whatever the seafront, it's just like rosé everywhere. I was famous and infamous for my performance.

Lenny (00:10:13):
I feel like you lived the worst nightmare that everybody has when they're thinking about giving a talk. And I think what's interesting is you survived, and I think that's a really interesting lesson is you could freeze in front of thousands of people, walk off stage, and then it works out okay.

Paul Adams (00:10:30):
And it all happened organically, I guess, or very naturally. But yeah, ever since then, every time I walk out onto a conference talk stage, still today, I ask myself, I have this tiny doubt in the back of my head. It's never happened since. But yeah, I think you have to go with it with these things. When life kind of throws you these whatever curve balls you have got to kind of adapt, and it's not that big a deal. None of these things are that big a deal. At the end of the day you kind of move on, live and learn. Yeah, but I still hope it doesn't happen again.

Lenny (00:11:02):
I also hate public speaking and I always fear this is exactly what's going to happen to me. And so I think this is nice to hear that even when the worst possible thing basically happens, things can survive.

Paul Adams (00:11:13):
You can turn it around. Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:15):
A second area I wanted to hear from is your time at Google and there's a couple products you worked on at Google. Both of them were not what you'd call big successes, and then there's kind of a transition to Facebook, which was also kind messy. Can you just share a couple stories from that time?

Paul Adams (00:11:31):
Yeah. Similar to the walking off stage thing, you live and learn, and I was at Google for four years. I was at Facebook for two and a half years or so. At Google I worked on a lot of failed social projects like you mentioned, Google Buzz, Google, and later Google+. I think a lot of the motivation for those projects came from a place of fear. It didn't come from a place of let's make a great product for people,.let's really understand the things people struggle with when communicating with family and friends. That's really, really try and create something wonderful. It came from a place of fear.

(00:12:10):
And so during those times I learned I think how not to lead in places. And by the way, I should say at the time in Google, there was other things happening that were amazing, like Google building Google Maps. Incredible product, one of my favorite products. I think one of the best products ever made. They were building Android. I was in the mobile team, in the mobile apps team at the time that Android came out. So incredibly good product. So I just happened to be in the social side, which wasn't as good.

(00:12:37):
And yeah, Google Buzz was kind of a privacy disaster, and Google+ similar. And so kind of halfway through I kind of published research about groups, and I've done a ton of research. An interesting kind of side note there is at the time I asked, I was working in the research, in the US team as a researcher, I was being asked to do a lot of tactical research, like usability study type stuff, like can people use these products? And I ended up doing a lot of formative research as well in the same session. So I'd kind of say to the team like, "Hey, I'll do the research, I'll answer your questions, but also I'm going to do this other thing, and I'm going to take 20 minutes doing that."

(00:13:16):
And so what we used to do is, what I used to do with people was map out their social network, all the people in it, their family, their friends, how they communicate. We'd map on all the channels, we'd talk about what worked well, what didn't. And we did this with dozens and dozens of people over the course of maybe 18 months. And the same pattern emerged every single time, which was people need way better ways to communicate with small groups of family and friends. And I kind of look back now and go like WhatsApp, or it maybe iMessage if everyone's on Apple, but really obvious in hindsight, but at the time, not obvious. And so we kind of tried to build a product around that called Google+, but again, it was kind of came from the wrong place. And so halfway through the research that I've done, all this research had been made public through a conference talk and Zuck and Facebook noticed, got in touch, one thing led to another and I left and joined Facebook, which was an amazing thing for me, personally.

(00:14:13):
Facebook was amazing, an amazing place at the time and exciting. And they were trying to do things for the other reasons, the kind of good reasons, like, "Hey, let's build an amazing product for people."

Lenny (00:14:22):
And this was during Google+ being built? You basically shifted.

Paul Adams (00:14:26):
Yeah, midway, I'm stressed to even telling you about it. The project hadn't been launched. It was still under wraps. It was highly confidential. Google had done a lot of things at the time that were the first for them. I don't know if they've done them since, but things like everyone worked in Google+ was sent to a different building. That building had a different key card. If you didn't work on Google+, you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google+. And so when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably. Other people thought I was enlightened. It depends on who you talked to, but it was the right thing for me to do. But at the time it was a hard thing to do.

Lenny (00:15:17):
I know there's also a lot of scrutiny in what you took with you and the process.

Paul Adams (00:15:23):
When I left, Google kind of assumed that I was one of the spies. I was quarantined when I told them I was leaving. They forensically analyzed my laptop, all sorts of stuff like that. So it was pretty intense. Looking back, I can understand why that happened, but the root cause for me is that the project has been run from a place of fear, competitive fear, which I don't think leads to good things.

Lenny (00:15:53):
So one of the themes through the stories you just shared is, let's say failure is... I don't want to make it that harsh, but just things not working out. And I'm curious as a product leader, how important you think that is for people to go through if you think that's something that is almost a good thing. And I guess just is there anything there that you find helpful as a coach, as a mentor, as someone, to people that are trying to become basically you?

Paul Adams (00:16:19):
It very, very... It still is. It still is. I've personally failed so many times. There are two stories and the Google one is long deep tentacles. There are two stories. I've failed a ton of times like at Intercom. I remember when I was at Facebook, I was very happy and I knew I wanted to [inaudible 00:16:39] the co-founders of Intercom and they're trying to persuade me to join Intercom. It was like 10 person company at the time. But Owen said something to me at that time, which has stuck with me ever since. He said, "At Facebook you can design the product, but at Intercom you can design the company." And that was extremely appealing to me, a great pitch. He's like, "Just design the company with us that you want to work in."

(00:17:03):
And so part of that was a company that embraces failure that says it's okay to try things. I'm a big believer in big bets, higher risk, higher reward. I don't get as excited about incremental things. Now I haven't said that, there's of course a place for that too, especially as companies get bigger. But I get excited about big bets and if you make big bets, you're going to get a lot of it wrong. So a lot of the principles that we built here at Intercom, on building software, we have a principle called ship to learn, and we've actually changed it since, still on the wall here. Ship fast, ship early, ship often is what it says now. Used to say ship to learn. Ship fast, ship early, ship often. It's like in that idea is the idea of failure. It's not going to go right, and it's going to go wrong more often than not. But if you ship early and fast and learn fast, you can change fast, and you can improve fast. And that's the kind of culture that we as much as possible try to embrace and teach people. But it's much easier said than done.

Lenny (00:18:05):
Especially when you're in the moment. Like Go damn, it, everything's going to fall apart. I really messed this one up.

Paul Adams (00:18:09):
Yeah. And there's a trade-off with quality that people really struggle with. We've high standards of ourselves. A lot of Intercom comes from a design founder background. We value the craft a lot. We never want to be embarrassed by what we ship. So there's a real tension there, a real trade-off where people have these high standards, which we encourage and we encourage them to ship fast and learn and make mistakes. It's a constant kind of tension that we're navigating.

Lenny (00:18:38):
Next up, we have Tom Conrad, who is chief product officer at Quibi and engineering leader at Pets.com. Two of the most memorable failures in product history, sharing his lessons from those wild experiences. Tom is currently CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is a killer business and an app in case you haven't come across it. I'd definitely check it out. Here's Tom.

(00:19:00):
You brought up this phrase of notable disasters and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, Pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. And so I just want to spend some time in these two areas, and maybe the way to set it up is just what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work, and maybe advice you share with people?

Tom Conrad (00:19:30):
Probably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually I think in both instances, they became kind of dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own sort of professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. And frankly, even in the case of Pets.com, like even the high profile nature of it, I could have worked at one of a thousand e-commerce websites in 1999. And when I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, I had never heard of the thing that you worked on, but everybody certainly heard about Pets.com.

(00:20:17):
It's a pretty funny example too of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. And while as a leadership team, we made, I'm sure, all kinds of mistakes. One of the things that happened was that there were three kind of over-funded pet e-commerce sites, and we all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then, and we all thought it was a zero-sum game and that we as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising. We all did, and it became this kind of unwinnable arms race. So there is, I think a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise.

(00:21:28):
And then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store. It's worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for 3 billion, biggest e-commerce acquisition of all time. And while I think it's probably unfair to compare, Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick, and turned it into something really remarkable. To Pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way.

(00:22:07):
The critique that is often leveled at Pets.com or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work, and that's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It's really, really early.

Lenny (00:22:25):
I saw a stat I think you shared somewhere that you took Pets.com from nothing, to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months.

Tom Conrad (00:22:33):
Yeah, yeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. And the leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. And it was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. And so it was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was sort of a fruitless attempt to salvage it.

Lenny (00:23:22):
Did not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?

Tom Conrad (00:23:33):
The kind of miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it relit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, I had done it for twenty-five years or something. And I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot, and I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. And it also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different. And I had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They were really, they were kind of ridiculous. Maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they were all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, "Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?" And I'd be like, "No, I don't know anything about baking." "Oh, you might landscape photography. Do you take photos?" "No, I don't make photos."

(00:24:41):
But I was kind of committed to the bit, actually to the point where when TechCrunch interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, "I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely." So that story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was called New TV at the time.

(00:25:07):
And the pitch was, "We're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and Consumer Tech and sort of weld it to the best of Hollywood-style content production to build something completely bespoke and purpose-made for consumption on the phone." They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. And I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody. It just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them? So I listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. And we kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow.

(00:26:05):
And then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product, and both of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself, both of them had left after about six weeks. And Meg's like, "We've raised all this money, and we've told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help, and I would consider it a personal favor if you would come and spend just a couple of days a week helping." She's like, "I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground."

(00:26:53):
And my wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist and loves her life as a freelance contributor. And she's like, "You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week, it's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it." And I'm like, "No, no. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself." And she's like, "No." She's like, "Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do."

(00:27:35):
Well, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away, and it was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch and to take advantage of all of the sort of modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. And I'm embarrassed about some of the what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience, because I just really fell in love with the industry again and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.

Lenny (00:28:28):
Is there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid, to try to pull towards?

Tom Conrad (00:28:36):
I think I sort of misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. And so that was always my ambition. Find a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it in a delightful way, go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across, the really great word of mouth.

(00:29:27):
But I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also, they're kind of a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation, and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon. And yes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation.

(00:30:14):
And I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money, but we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. So it was a pretty major accomplishment. And we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.

(00:31:19):
One super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired. So there was no back catalog of it, and it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out, and it was really expensive. Like I said, it was a third of the investment we were going to make in content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content. And we launched two weeks into Covid, and we couldn't make any of that content except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood.

(00:32:10):
Now you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that. But I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, is that enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself. Our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format. And so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take six or eight or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone can stomach.

Lenny (00:33:20):
Next up, we've got Sri Batchu, former head of growth at Ramp who shares something that I've thought about ever since we had this conversation, which is this idea that when you fail, make sure you fail conclusively to make this failure an actual learning that you can build off of versus just a waste of time. Here's Sri.

Sri Batchu (00:33:38):
Growth experiments in my history are typically like 30%-ish success rate. So the vast majority of things that you try don't work. And so you want to create a culture where people aren't afraid to take risks and aren't afraid to fail. And for me, failure is not that you didn't drive revenue, failure is not learning. So it's really important that you learn when you fail. And so we celebrate failure as long as you're learning, and you can only learn if you've designed the right test and you failed conclusively, because otherwise I think many of us have been in situations where there's intuition that something might work and it doesn't work, and then you end up doing it over and over for years because every time a new executive or somebody else has the same idea, you try it again. And it's because you haven't been able to design the test to fail conclusively.

(00:34:31):
It's hard to do. But at the end of the day, there's only two ways to make an experiment successful. Either you have a very large M or you have a very significant treatment, which is what you're doing in the experiment itself. And in B2B, you don't usually have the luxury of large M, which you [inaudible 00:34:54] consumer.

(00:34:54):
Facebook can get [inaudible 00:34:56] in two hours. A B2B company could take two years to get to the same number of touch points. And so to counteract that, I recommend people just trying to maximize the treatment effect, which is like if you have a hypothesis that you're testing, just throw all of the possible tactics and resources that you think would move that needle because you can always cost rationalize later if it works.

(00:35:22):
And so just maximize the treatment effect. And if with all of that it didn't work, then you can say, "Hey, we're not going to try this again because we literally did try everything that we could to test this hypothesis. And if it doesn't work in the best version, and it's expensive as it is, this is not worth spending more time on." But if it does work, great. Then you do another version of the test with half the tactics or whichever tactics you think work better or worse and you optimize over time.

Lenny (00:35:49):
Is there an example you could share when you did that?

Sri Batchu (00:35:53):
Account-based marketing is something that is very common in enterprise software where you've selected certain customers that you think are high priority and you're saying, "I want to touch them in as many nuanced ways possible to see if that drives conversion." And this is something I've seen tried many times where people do it, but they kind of do it halfway where they're like, okay, tried these three things. Conversion of the control group wasn't higher, and so we think it is not going to work. And then a new go-to-market executive comes and they have to do it again. They have to do it again. They have to do it again. It's like a very common one wherever this happens. And so when we did it at Ramp, we did exactly what I just described, which is like, let's really be thoughtful about the experiment design, both in terms of maximizing the number of people as well as maximizing the number of ways and types of ways that we're effectively touching these target customers to show the value one way or the other.

Lenny (00:37:03):
So what it sounds like is the hypothesis isn't like this email will have a big impact on conversion. It's like this strategy of coming after customers is what we're testing.

Sri Batchu (00:37:15):
That's the example there. And I think for example, if you had the... This kind of framework is more important for cross-functional, larger scale, bigger tests rather than an email modification. But we can even use it on a micro example like an email modification where you are like, "Okay, I think this particular email is underperforming because it's not talking to this part of the customer's pain point or journey or what have you." And you could just, the simplest test would be, okay, let me make some tweaks to the text and edit that, and that could be the end of that test. And if that doesn't work, you're like, "Oh, maybe those weren't the right text edits. Let me do a different text edits or whatever."

(00:38:02):
And that's fine, that's low cost. It's not the end of the world and it's for you to be wrong there. But an alternative that you could do is like, "Oh, what are all of the things that I could change about this email in the same test?" Is it the trigger of the email? Is it the text content of the email? Is it additional personalization? Is it the design of the email? Trying to think of what are all of the various levers that you think could be wrong and put them all together to test your hypothesis of this touch point is wrong, and how do I improve that?

Lenny (00:38:34):
Well, obviously the downside of that is you, if it doesn't work, you don't know if it's like, oh, maybe it was this thing could have worked in the subject.

Sri Batchu (00:38:40):
Yeah, so there's always trade-offs on this, but what you're hoping is you've done a complete refresh where you did all the things that you thought were intuitive that should work. And if it doesn't work, then you're like, okay, maybe my hypothesis wrong. But you're right. There's always going to be a challenge if maybe the execution is wrong. And I did too many things potentially in that case.

Lenny (00:39:01):
Our next story is from JZ, who is a colleague of mine at Airbnb, head of product at Webflow when we recorded this episode, and this is her sharing the story of one of the biggest product misses at Airbnb.

(00:39:13):
You've seen a lot of new PMs, and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?

Jiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:39:27):
I think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course, but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something, something that you can see in your head that you want to build. And so that's the first thing I really want to like unteach in our course.

(00:39:50):
And so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, "I want to build X startup," or, "I want to do this thing," or, "I am in blank school, and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area." And so untraining that and being like, "Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, hey, you want to build X thing for Y person." So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.

Lenny (00:40:25):
So let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?

Jiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:40:34):
Wow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there.

(00:40:43):
 And this one does stand out to me. So we're working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we're really trying to do is to be like, "Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of it's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that we're all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?" But I do think we were very solution first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Saunders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like, "Oh, look at this. What are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?"

(00:41:19):
And so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, "Let's go inspect our inventory. Let's actually try to manage our inventory more." And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, "What's the real problem?" The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better. And I think the other piece here that's really important is what, as a company, is there strategic strength? And what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. We again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics. Are the unit economics actually going to work, even as you scale?

Lenny (00:42:03):
Yeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell, and that could be its own podcast, I guess.

Jiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:42:09):
You and I can tell it.

Lenny (00:42:10):
We could tell it. This could be Airbnb Plus the hidden, the story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust, they don't want to even consider Airbnb. Like, "No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable." And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. We're going to get them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar. And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like this is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this, because we don't make that much booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical. Or do you think there was a path, and it was just not executed well?

Jiaona Zhang (JZ) (00:42:51):
I think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was [inaudible 00:42:55]. Exactly. And it was more just like if you understood, again, this is my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, "Well, when we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen." I think you actually need to really make sure the unit economics work right at the beginning. So that is definitely one lesson.

(00:43:14):
And I think the other thing is, and going back to the spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.

(00:43:32):
And I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about? Is it cleaning? Is it the, "Hey, I'm locked out." And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property, right? It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas, and then get that as part of the feat as opposed to doing inspection.

(00:44:04):
So again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas, and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at? And so yeah, I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that, or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning, and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all. Hey, we're going to go inspect. It's like, what is the problem for this listing, and what's the best solution to fix that problem?

Lenny (00:44:33):
Our second to last story is from Gina Gotthilf, who was an early growth leader at Duolingo. She's currently COO of Latitud, and this is her sharing a wide-ranging and important point about how everyone has both an A side and a B side to their career, and people often only share their A side. So this is Gina sharing her B side.

Gina Gotthilf (00:44:53):
We are very encouraged in our lives, especially professionally, to talk about our A side all the time because that's what impresses people. That's what opens doors, that's what allows us to keep growing, and it's so important. So it means that a lot of what you hear in podcasts and on stage ends up being the Instagramable version of someone or a company or a country's trajectory. It's just the highlights. And when I talk about my A side, it's very impressive. I did things like, we'll talk about, I met President Obama, I worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign. I helped Duolingo scale from three to 200 million users. I worked with Tumblr, helping them scale Latin America, Andreesen Horowitz invested in my company, etc.

(00:45:34):
But between all of those highlights, there were so many B moments that get shoved under the rug because it's just easier for me and it's more impressive for others. But I really like to highlight those because I think that most of us have a lot of B moments every day, every week, every month, and every period of our lives. And it's easy to think that things aren't just not going to work out for us because we're in one of those B moments if we don't recognize them as moments.

Lenny (00:45:59):
I love this concept. We're going to talk as you expected about a lot of your A side stuff. Is there any example of a B side story of your life that would be interesting to share?

Gina Gotthilf (00:46:09):
Look, I think those are the most interesting because they're funny or ridiculous. I had a lot of B sides, and I still do. For example, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I actually wanted to be. I thought I wanted to be an actress. I either wanted to be that person in Sea World, who goes like this with a dolphin. This is before Sea World was canceled. Or I wanted to be an actress. I applied to schools. I didn't get into any Ivy League. I didn't get into any of the top schools I wanted to go to. When I got to college, I actually ended up dropping out because I got so depressed, incredibly depressed, couldn't get out of bed depressed. Ironically, I dropped out of Reed College, which is the same college that Steve Jobs dropped out of. So I was just destined for greatness. I knew it at that moment.

Lenny (00:46:53):
It all makes sense looking backwards, as he said.

Gina Gotthilf (00:46:55):
Totally. I was dropping out, being like, "Yes, this is exactly the path." No, I was miserable. I thought there was no path forward. And I finally went back and graduated. The college counselor looked at my curriculum and said, "What have you even done with your life? There's nothing to show for." And it was shocking because I was always the overachiever who wants to do the maximum curriculum and ace all of my classes and do whatever. I did three diplomas in high school, the international, the American, the Brazilian.

(00:47:22):
And so that for me, I think my one learning there that has stuck with me, and I think it can work for other people too, is that it's not just about doing things that actually matter and learning. It's about being able to tell the story, and it's about understanding what other people perceive as valuable. I applied to a hundred companies. I didn't hear back from most of them. I finally got an internship at kind a tier B/C digital marketing agency in New York City because I wanted to live in New York so badly. And they forgot to apply for my visa on time. So I lost my visa and had to go back to Brazil, and then I ended up leaving that organization to go work for another one. And I won't even go into the details of the shadiness of that company that I worked for, but then they ended up laying me off. So I lost my visa again, had to go back home, found another opportunity, got fired that time. So there was just a lot of rockiness in my start that I don't think you would imagine when you see someone up on stage leading a conference for 5,000 people. That I think is important.

(00:48:26):
And even when I started working for Tumblr, I was like, "This is it. I made it. This is a really interesting company. This is going to work out." That was super rocky because it was an early stage startup. So for example, they couldn't figure out how to wire money to Brazil. So I was not paid for six months. And at one point, me and my colleagues were trying to get money out of the teller to pay contractors because we had no money to pay them, and we borrowed money from people. And finally they also laid me off because they decided to sell to Yahoo.

(00:48:54):
And then I had to figure out what am I going to do? No one's going to hire me. I've been fired and laid off so many times. So this is all before I started an agency to help US-based tech companies and startups grow in Latin America because I figured I was in this really great place to make that happen. And it eventually worked for, well-known companies such as Duolingo. At the time they weren't well-known. They were a tiny little startup. They didn't have an Android app. And that's how I started working with Duolingo because their head of marketing connected with someone they had worked with at Flickr and said, "I noticed Tumblr grew a lot in Brazil last year. Can you recommend a company or an agency to help?" And they said, "This girl." And I was twenty-six. And so that's how they connected me with Duolingo. And I started helping them grow in Brazil as a consultant. They were like, "This is great. Can you help us grow in Chile, Argentina?" And I was like, "Yes." They were like, "How about Mexico?" And I was like, "Yes." Did I know anything about these places, Lenny? Did I know people there? No, but you can figure it out.

(00:49:51):
And then they ended up asking me to come on full time, do that across the world, Japan, China, Korea, Turkey, Spain, France, et cetera. And then to own growth, which ended up meaning communications, social media, government partnerships, anything to grow. And then eventually became an A/B testing growth engine with engineers and PMs and designers of which I knew nothing about.

(00:50:15):
And even after that, I left Duolingo five years later, didn't know what to do with my life. You'd think, "Oh wow, you have it figured out now. You left Duolingo, you have the world in front of you." And I'm like, "Maybe I can finally go work for nonprofits," which is what I actually wanted to do in the first place. Tried a hand at that. Had a couple of experiences before going to work for the Mike Bloomberg campaign.

(00:50:36):
Working for the Mike Bloomberg campaign is impressive. But you know what? Mike Bloomberg didn't win. He's not the president. So that was not a successful campaign if you really look at it. And yeah, Latitud seems like it's a really promising path, but there's A days and B days. So it's just a lot of that. And just staying resilient and believing in yourself and getting back on the horse when you fall on your face.

Lenny (00:51:00):
Amazing. That's such an important message. I think one of the threads from what you're describing, something that I think about a lot is people kind of underestimate how long their career is. There's just so much time to do stuff and for things to start to work. This going to sound really fancy, but I think Marcus Aurelius has this quote about how our life is actually very long. We just use it really badly and we just waste a lot of our time.

Gina Gotthilf (00:51:21):
I think you're so right, Lenny, and I love that because people are going around being like, "Life is short, life is short." But that's so true. We waste so much time. But also I think we don't recognize how much opportunity we have in front of us. And as a 26-year-old, I definitely thought my career was over. I was like, "I blew it." And looking back, it's funny.

Lenny (00:51:40):
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I spent nine years at my first job at a random company in San Diego in a startup. I was like, "What am I doing here so long?" And it turned out that was really useful for the thing I did next. And then eventually, wow, things started to really take off. So I think that's a really good lesson for people. It's just a long time. This is my fourth career. I've switched careers many times. I was an engineer then. I was a founder. Then I was a product manager, and whatever this is. Whatever you call this thing.

Gina Gotthilf (00:52:06):
I guess me, too. I was an operator. I was a consultant. Well, I was an employee. I was a consultant. Then I was an operator, which is a fancy way to say employee at a startup. And then now I'm a founder and a VC and an angel and whatever this is..

Lenny (00:52:22):
Awesome. Awesome. So I think that's a really important takeaways. Just there's a lot of time to do stuff and don't stress if things aren't moving as fast as you want. I'm curious, what's a mess-up or a big mistake maybe that you made or your teammate that was like, "Oh wow, that was a big waste of time."

Gina Gotthilf (00:52:38):
Yeah, look, a lot of things didn't work out. More than 50% of our A/B tests didn't work out. We made bets that didn't make sense. I will say though, that in the spirit of A and B sides, I, and I think in general, we are really good at forgetting the B stuff. I talk so much about all the stuff that worked that it's hard to remember all of those moments that didn't actually work. And the thing that I tend to talk about, which is this mistake that we made as the growth team is almost like one of those, when you get asked in an interview, what's your biggest weakness, and you're like, "I'm a perfectionist." It's like one of those things that actually makes you sound good because it's the story about how my team really wanted to implement badges. We spent a lot of time playing all the games that were popular at the time, trying to understand how those gamification growth hacks that we could find in those apps would potentially overlay onto Duolingo and how we would do that.

(00:53:35):
And badges was just pervasive in all of the top games. And so it seemed like a no-brainer, but since we ranked all of our experiments in terms of ROI and return being like how many users we think we're going to get from this DAUs, and time investments, it never made sense to focus on this because we thought that the time sink would be too high. So I actually ended up not letting the team run this experiment for six months so that we focused on lower hanging fruit. So that's a mistake on my end.

(00:54:04):
Then we decided to run this experiment in the most lean way possible. We're like, "You know what? There's MVEs. There's minimum viable experiments. We don't have to run a whole badges thing. We can just do something more simple and actually see if that leads to growth in an interesting way, and then we'll know."

(00:54:20):
And we ran this very simple experiment that was like, you signed up and then you get a badge. And it was like this girl with a balloon. I don't know, she was happy or whatever. And of course in retrospect, it led to no results, because no one is proud of signing up. It's not an exciting moment, and you don't even have badges to collect. You can't show it to other people. None of the things that make badges compelling were there, but we were like, "Okay, well, we tested it didn't work." And then we moved on.

(00:54:42):
So we moved on for another, I don't know, eight months and we didn't look back. And then when we did look back, first of all at that point we discovered that we hadn't been dogfooding, which also was embarrassing. Looking back, we hadn't been dogfooding in the growth team. We just come up with hypotheses. We were super careful about prioritizing them and making sure that we were doing the best possible write ups and all these things. But the dogfooding piece, I didn't come from a product background. I was a marketer and I didn't really understand the term dogfooding, but when we thought, we had a conversation, we were like, "You know what? If we had just tested that, we would've all known that this was a super lame badge." And I was like, "Why are we not testing our experiments?" And so that became part of our practice.

(00:55:26):
It's still relevant. I just had a conversation yesterday with engineers at Latitud. I haven't explained what we built yet, where we're building it. Maybe we'll get there, but I was talking yesterday, [inaudible 00:55:35] at Latitud, and they're awesome. In terms of product team, we have the number eight employee at NewBank. You might've heard of NewBank, but it's this massive banking fintech in Latin America. And we have people from other fintechs. And then we have this guy who was a lead PM at Twilio, and I was explaining to them why we should be dogfooding. And they were all like, "Oh yeah, we should dogfood." It's just easy to forget stuff like that.

(00:55:58):
So that was a mistake that we could have probably gotten to the growth that we got to with badges much earlier on. And not only did we get to growth with badges, but it became this amazing treasure trove of opportunity because once you have badges and people want them, you can now ask people to do anything. Go find friends, go buy things, whatever it is. And so we impacted almost all metrics across the company positively, including some we hadn't expected, but it's easy to talk about a mistake that ended up being a win. So that's why I compared it to the interview thing in the beginning. But we tried making Duolingo a social app really early on and failed. It was called Dual Duels. Dual Duels. You could duel.

Lenny (00:56:42):
Very clever.

Gina Gotthilf (00:56:43):
Yeah, I know we were clever, but people didn't use it and we didn't figure out why. We tried making a Duolingo for schools platform. We couldn't get it to pick up. I went and watched dueling go in China and it got downloaded by a million people in the first day, and then the app got blocked because of the government, and then we couldn't figure out what to do. And then everyone rated the app like one star because it didn't work. And so then we had a lot of trouble actually recovering from that. We launched Duolingo in India and didn't realize because we couldn't have unless we went there, which we finally did, that most people set their phone UI in India to English, because typing in Hindi is hard. And of course there's a lot of languages throughout India, and we were making it so that when you downloaded Duolingo, whatever UI you open your app, your phone was set to, we offered not that language for you to learn. That was your base language. So we were telling people learn French, Spanish, German from English, and they were all trying to learn English, so they didn't find what they were looking for and they left. There were so many mistakes and luckily I think we were able to bounce back from most of them in terms of how Duolingo was doing today.

Lenny (00:57:53):
And our final story is from Maggie Crowley VP of product at Toast, and one of the most beloved episodes of the podcast. This is Maggie sharing something a little bit different, her favorite interview question about failure and what it tells you about the person you're interviewing. Plus a story of her own product failure. Here's Maggie.

Maggie Crowley (00:58:12):
A question I ask in every product interview is, what's the worst product you've ever shipped? And that's because I don't think you're a good PM if you haven't shipped something that's really shitty. You just haven't had enough reps, you haven't done it enough times. And it's not only that you've done it, but that you can admit it and which one it is. That's so important.

(00:58:34):
I remember... It was so dumb. I'm still so mad about this that we did this. I won't name which team, which company, I'm not going to call that out, but we decided we needed to do a rewrite red flag number one of existing product, and engineer who I'd worked with many times, we had a really good relationship and this person was like, "Yeah, yeah, it's going to take six months. No problem." Core part of the product, been around for forever. One of those things that the code is still the code written by the founders kind of thing.

(00:59:07):
It didn't take six months. It took two and a half years. It still wasn't done. It almost never... It went on for so much longer than it should have. It took us forever to get to feature parody. It was the worst project. So many people rotated in and out of it. Everyone thought it was dumb. Sunk cost fallacy, just the worst. And it's because, A, we got arrogant and we thought we could do it. B, we skipped discovery. We didn't really write a one pager. We just went for it. We didn't do enough technical and design research into what the requirements would actually have to be. And there you have it.

Lenny (00:59:46):
And did not work out, or was it a huge success in the end and it changed the trajectory of the business?

Maggie Crowley (00:59:50):
Absolutely not. But you know what? I didn't get fired, so it's fine.

Lenny (00:59:54):
I feel like I've gone through those experiences and then three, four years later, it's like another... Maybe this rewrite and redesign may work. We haven't updated this thing in a long time.

Maggie Crowley (01:00:04):
Just don't do it. Don't rewrite. If anyone ever tells you to do a rewrite, don't do it. A side-by-side rewrite, nope.

Lenny (01:00:11):
Yeah, I've never had... What I run into is once you get too far down a redesign slash rewrite, everyone's building in that new world, and then you launch, and experiment's negative, and then it's just like, "Oh, we just got to launch it. We're going to call it back. We're going to figure out how to get back to neutral someday."

Maggie Crowley (01:00:26):
Yeah yeah. Don't do that.

Lenny (01:00:28):
Good times.

(01:00:29):
And that is a wrap. I hope you enjoy these stories of failure. I want to give a huge special thank you to all of our amazing guests for being vulnerable and sharing these stories of failure in their career. I hope you leave this episode with a new perspective on how setbacks and challenges and failure can often be exactly what you need to get to the next step of your career or your life.

## Transcript

Garrett Lord (00:00:00):
There will never be a time like this. I've never seen anything like it. I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand. How do you make sure that three months from now, six months, you have no regrets? Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
Your company creates new data to continue advancing the intelligence of models. This is a business that you built on top of a business you've already had. 

Garrett Lord (00:00:24):
We're the largest expert network in the world. We have this massive strategic advantage, which is like no customer acquisition costs. The only moat in human data is access to an audience. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
You guys come in after the model's trained to tweak the weights based on additional data that you you've created. 

Garrett Lord (00:00:38):
The models have gotten so good that the generalists are no longer needed. What they really need is experts. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
There's this tension between all these students training models to become smarter, and then there's that they will have harder time potentially finding jobs. 

Garrett Lord (00:00:52):
That's not what we're hearing from our employers, this is just enabling human beings to be even more productive. You used to put a Google Search on a skill on your resume because you grew up with Google. Being AI native, young people are at a huge advantage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):
Today my guest is Garrett Lord. Garrett is the co-founder and CEO of Handshake, which is one of the most interesting and incredible AI success stories that you probably haven't heard of. Handshake has been around for over 10 years, they're essentially LinkedIn for college students, it's a place for students to connect with companies to find a job. They are the platform of choice for every single Fortune 500 company. Over 1,500 colleges, over 20 million students and alumni, and over 1 million companies use them to hire graduates. At the start of this year, Garrett and his team realized that their huge proprietary network of students, including tens of thousands of PhDs and master's students, is extremely valuable to AI labs to help them create and label high quality training data. So, they launched a new business from zero to one in January. Four months later, they hit 50 million ARR. They're now on pace to blow past 100 million ARR within just 12 months. They'll exceed the revenue that they're making with their decade old business in under two years. 

(00:02:04):
This is a truly incredible and rare story, and one that I think a lot of teams can learn from because AI is creating a lot of opportunity but also a lot of potential disruption, and this is an amazing story where the company basically disrupted themselves. This episode is packed with insights, including a primer on what the heck are people actually doing when they're labeling and creating data to train models? A huge thank you to Garrett for making time for this, his wife just had a baby this week. He's also in the middle of scaling this insane new business. So thank you, Garrett.

(00:05:04):
Garrett, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast. 

Garrett Lord (00:05:07):
Yeah, thanks for having me. A long-time subscriber.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:09):
I appreciate that. Okay, so before we get into the insane trajectory that your data labeling business is on, which is just an amazing story that I think a lot of founders and product teams that are trying to navigate this AI disruption that's happening will have a lot to learn from. I want to first help people understand what the hell data labeling actually is. Just like, what are people actually doing? Why is this so valuable? Some of the most, I don't know, fastest-growing companies in the world today, including you guys are just, this is what you do. Clearly there's something really important here. I sort of understand it, probably not really. I think a lot of listeners feel the same way. So let me just ask you this, what is data labeling actually? What are people actually doing? And then, just why is this so valuable to frontier AI labs?

Garrett Lord (00:05:55):
Yeah. So, I think it's helpful to take a step back of what does training a model look like? So, there's really two primary functions. There's a pre-training and a post-training process in training a model, and for a long time these AI providers, or LLMs, or Frontier Labs we're focused on basically sucking up more and more information on the pre-training side of the house. And that's basically the entire corpus of written human knowledge. So, that's not just written, but every YouTube video, every book, basically the pursuit of sucking up everything that was on the internet, and that was the pre-training side. And there was a lot of gains from pre-training, like models continue to get better. And about 18 months ago, 24 months ago, we started to really see an asymptoting of gains coming from, because they had essentially sucked up all of the knowledge on the internet. And so, labs really shifted towards most of the gains now coming from the post-training side of the house. 

(00:06:50):
And what post-training is, is it's augmenting and improving the data they have across every discipline or capability area that they care about. So take coding, or mathematics, or law or finance, they are focused on collecting high quality data that really improves the state of our capabilities, their models, and you can see a lot of these popular benchmarks on what are called model parts. When Llama IV is released, you'll see the benchmarks across various domains, and each one of the research teams inside of the labs have different use cases. Basically they're running experiments, almost think like the scientific process. They have a hypothesis around how to improve the model. They're trying to collect small pieces of data to see if that hypothesis works out. If that hypothesis is proving true, then they expand the overall collection of the data in that advert. And it could look like reinforcement learning environments, it could look like trajectories, it could be audio and multimodal, it can be text-based like prompt-response pairs. 

(00:07:58):
It can also be reinforcement learning with human feedback, which is like preference ranking data. And so, that's the state of the art of models. And most of the gains that are happening from models right now are coming from the post-training side of the house. And there's just an incredible amount of demand to stay at the absolute frontier of where models are going.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:20):
So training, pre-training is feeding it, say the entire internet. Here's like all the data that the humans have ever created, figure out knowledge and facts, and how to reason and all these things. Post-training, is it correct to say there's essentially two buckets of things to do? There's reinforcement learning, human feedback RLHF, and then there's kind of this bucket of fine-tuning?

Garrett Lord (00:08:41):
I mean, yes and no because take for example trajectories, or you want to be able to do, people use flight search or an accounting end-to-end process, or you want to be able to conduct biological experiments, you need actual trajectory data. There's still very much, a lot of the labs are still, they have points of view on what data collect. It's evolving very quickly. But I think reinforcement learning is really preference ranking, like which question do you like more, question A or question B? SFT data is a prompt and a response, and obviously the labs are very focused on these thinking or reasoning models. So, in order to improve a reasoning model you need to actually have the step-by-step instructions, of which when you interact with a lot of these frontier models they struggle in very advanced domains. And so, I think there's a variety of data that they're working with to improve capabilities in their models.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
What I'm hearing is there's other ways to post-train. Which of these are you guys focused on? Where do you help models most of these three-ish buckets?

Garrett Lord (00:09:48):
Our real unique proposition as a business is the fact that we have an engaged audience. We have 18 million professionals across, we have 500,000 PhDs, we have 3 million master students, we're a global platform. And so, depending on what you're looking for across any area, academic knowledge, what is the definition of a PhD? How do you get your PhD? You defend your thesis. Defending your thesis means, generally speaking, you have proven that you have extended the world's knowledge in a particular domain. And so, the ability to hyper-target this audience into chemistry, math, physics, biology, coding and really touch parts of human knowledge that have never before made it to the internet is really where we excel. And I would say that when you talk about the labeling market, something to make it more abstract is like it used to be generalists' work. 

(00:10:52):
A lot of the market before the model started to get better was leveraging talented international lower cost labor to do basic generalist tasks. But really what's happened is the models have gotten so good that the generalists are no longer needed. What they really need is experts, experts across every area that the models are focused on. And really, you could think about these model builders as they're focused on the most economically valuable capability areas in the economy. And so that, generally speaking, right now is focused on advanced STEM domains, advanced science and math domains, and then the derivative functions of accounting, law, medicine, finance, where they want to make the models more capable. And then the work that we're doing, I think to come full circle to your question, we're doing work across so many domains. I mean, we have millions of bachelor students that are being used for work in audio, work in customizing a model depending on the voice and tone, where you are geographically in the country, what do women versus men prefer? All the way to the most advanced PhD STEM domains out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:08):
Okay. So, is it fair to say essentially all the data that is available has been trained on, and your company creates new data, new knowledge to continue advancing the intelligence of models?

Garrett Lord (00:12:22):
Yep. And I also say we help point out where the models are weak. So, in order to break a model, it's pretty tough for the average person to break a model and get an incorrect response. But if you are a PhD in physics, you can go in multiple subdomains of physics and prove where the model's actually breaking, either breaking in its reasoning steps or it's where it's broken in its ground truth right answer, or we start throwing tools in there or needing to follow some step-by-step process. And I wouldn't say it's easy for them, but the average person cannot break the models and that's where we really come in.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):
So, essentially it's just catching mistakes that the model has made. Okay. So, what are these people actually doing? I know there's all kinds of different types, you described all the ways that data's generated, what kind of data is useful? So, maybe just the most common examples. Let's say a PhD person is sitting there doing stuff, what are they actually doing?

Garrett Lord (00:13:22):
A great example is a public paper called GPQA. So, for the engineers out there that want to read about it, essentially the crux of the paper is you break the model, you provide a ground truth, the right answer to the question, you provide the step-by-step a reasoning steps. So, you might imagine because models are non-deterministic, the model can get the answer right once, but it might not get the answer right three out of five times. So, you actually prove where the model's failing. You actually break down into where is it failing? Maybe it can get, it knows the question, it can get the right answer, but the actual steps to get there are wrong and they really focus on the steps to get there. Say there's 10 steps in a math problem, step 6 through 10 is wrong. So, how do you fix the actual steps? 

(00:14:11):
And what are they doing? So they're going in, we're really focused on calling this branding the experience and treating people like experts. PhD students expect to be treated different than a lower cost international labor with a different work expectation. And so, these PhDs come into a community, we have a instructional design team and an assessments team that's going through and basically iteratively helping them understand how to use the tools that we built, and how to interact with the latest models. Then they go in and start actually creating data. And that process is, on our side the model builders, they want to know that the data we're producing is high quality. Som we have our own research team, our own post-training team. 

(00:14:53):
I hired a gentleman from Meta that went along on the post-training over there, and I-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:57):
Hope you paid him well. 

Garrett Lord (00:14:59):
Yeah. So, war for AI talent is very expensive, but super, super privileged and proud to be working with him. And so, each unit of data, we have to build it an environment for them to actually create the data. Then we have to understand in a unit level we're trying to approximate the actual gain from that piece of data and whether it can improve in a particular capability area. And then, we're also focused on evolving the use cases to also follow what the model builders want, which is they want more more real world tool use and trajectory based data as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):
Okay. There's so much here, and we could go infinitely down here but I think that this is really interesting because just like people hear so much about all of this and they barely understand what the hell it actually is. So, this is for me really interesting. I think it's going to help a lot of people. So essentially a PhD, say a biologist, biology PhD is just their job is find flaws in what, say ChatGPT is producing, and then come up with here's the correct answer. And that is used to fine tune the mode, here's something you are doing incorrectly, here's the correct answer and that improves the model.

Garrett Lord (00:15:33):
Yep. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:03):
Is that a simple way to think about it? And please correct anything I'm saying that is incorrect because I don't want people to misunderstand it.

Garrett Lord (00:16:08):
Yeah. I mean, a great example, let's take a non-verifiable domain like education. So there's a PhD student, Rachel on the network, she got her PhD from the University of Miami, spent two decades as a teacher teaching students in the eighth grade. And she was an adjunct professor at a local community college in the field of education. And so, she is interacting with the state-of-the-art models in educational design. So, actually trying to understand what is the best way to teach people, and how do you spot incorrect issues in a model in the way that they're training people, and help the models understand the forefront of educational design with the hands-on experience of being an eighth grade teacher for 10 plus years and having a PhD in education? So, that's an example of you can have that all the way down to a verifiable engineering problem that you're seeing the latest models fail on.

(00:17:12):
Yeah, I think that gives you the gamut. You also have, we talk about professional domains like these reinforcement learning environments, there's a bunch of papers out there that basically speak to people narrating over their step-by-step tool use. So, as they go to solve a problem from start to finish, interact with multiple different service areas, interact with multiple different tools, they're like, there's papers that talk about this, talking over what they're doing, actually following and screen recording where their mouse is going, how they're problem solving. When they run into a roadblock, what do they do? So, they really want to understand how humans think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):
You mentioned this term trajectory. Can you just explain what that actually means? Because it feels like you've mentioned that a few times and that feels important to all this.

Garrett Lord (00:17:56):
Yeah. A trajectory is basically just like the entire environment that is collecting what you're doing. So it's your screen, it's your mouse-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:04):
Oh, I see. Oh, wow. 

Garrett Lord (00:18:05):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):
Including this voiceover, okay. And then, this might be too technical, but what is the output of all this work? This, say teacher, is it just like a JSON file, an XML file, like a text file?

Garrett Lord (00:18:15):
Yeah, it can be managed JSON data.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:17):
JSON data? Okay. 

Garrett Lord (00:18:18):
And then, we also have multimodal work like audio, like classifying music and understanding ... We're engaging thousands, or not thousands, probably hundreds of top music students at the music schools in the country who are improving models of understanding of music. And you also have the thing called, which we haven't talked about here, a rubrics, and rubric models are, you can put a model in as a judge. What is a good educational design, or what's a good MRI result? In some of these domains, you actually don't have a guaranteed correct right answer. And so, models can sit in the middle as a judge and actually understand what is ... Think back on your school days. How do you get A on your 5,000 word paper? Well, there's a great introductory statement and there's scientific proof. So, you can build a rubric that allows a model to sit in the middle and actually auto-evaluate responses. We're seeing a lot of rubrics work as well. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:28):
And you would think, why would you trust this one teacher's opinion that this is the right way to do it? But what's cool is the market speaks for itself. If these models are being used more and more, and people love them and value them, I imagine steps in between to verify this is good and other people think this is a good idea. It feels like the market dynamics will tell you if the data you're providing is correct at what people want. Is there something more there?

Garrett Lord (00:19:52):
I didn't get a PhD in AI, or math, or physics, and I haven't trained myself, we have frontier models, but there is a lot to each unit of data whether it's improving. There's a ton of science and research out right now around how do you make sure that the data that you're producing is improving the model? And it's very hard for model builders to understand. They really care about, to zoom out, they care about three things. They care about quality first and foremost. You have to have high quality data. And if you imagine you're training a model, like teaching a student and you're giving it the wrong data, it's extremely challenging to overcome that. So, quality is first and foremost. And then, the other huge problems you have is volume. How do you generate thousands of pieces of data in the most advanced domains of chemistry, and mathematics, and physics, and how do you ensure that it's high quality?

(00:20:48):
Well for us, say in physics, we just reach out to students at Stanford, and Berkeley, and MIT, and they're at the top GPA at the best physics schools in the country. And so, our ability to get to scale or volumes of data, to produce very high quality data, is something they care deeply about. And then, the other thing I would say model builders care about is speed, because they have all these hypotheses and they're constantly testing different pipelines. And so, you might have three or four bets going at once, and then as soon as one is actually showing a gain, imagine you're a researcher or you're assigned to the processes, once you're running a gain then you're trying to grow that pipeline and grow that piece of data that's actually improving it, and you're maybe ditching two or three other projects you had that weren't showing improvement. 

(00:21:31):
So, your ability to quickly turn around for them in a period of days, and then get to high volumes of data that are high quality is the number one thing they care about. And so, there's quite a bit of technology we built on our side to assess each unit of data. We have our own post-training teams, we're renting our own GPUs, and we're trying to make sure that we can sit directly with these researchers and help share what we're seeing with the data that we're creating and how it could improve their model, how they could best train with it. So, hopefully that helps.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:03):
Going back to the types of post-training, just because I think this might be helpful, at least for me the mental model of there's pre-training, there's post-training, within post-training there's reinforcement learning, human feedback, there's this concept of fine-tuning. There's also evals and stuff like-

Garrett Lord (00:22:03):
There's SFT, yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:19):
SFT, which is supervised fine-tuning? Is that-

Garrett Lord (00:22:22):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
Yeah. So, the stuff you've been describing, would you mostly describe that as supervised fine-tuning?

Garrett Lord (00:22:29):
Yes, and we're doing all of the above. We don't do the auto eval, we produce rubrics which are used auto evals. But yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:39):
Okay, awesome. So essentially there's a model, it's trained on all this amazing data. You guys come in after the model's trained to tweak the weights based on additional data that you create. What's interesting is that this is a scalable system. I want to talk about just the supply of amazing people that you have producing this, but it's amazing that humans can do this. You would think it needs to be this infinitely scalable thing, but humans sitting there creating data is working and improving the intelligence of models significantly.

Garrett Lord (00:23:13):
Oh, yeah. I mean, I think maybe a funny joke is all the MBAs think this is all just going to go away. And I think for as long as models are improving, humans will be needed in this process. And when you talk to the lead scientists and researchers at these labs, it's like the data types will evolve and what they're trying to capture and collect, but there will be humans needed in the space for the next decade until we reach full ASI. So yeah, I mean, you think about in a lot of them will struggle to do basic trajectories right now. So, right now people are very focused on academic domains, and I think they'll continue to be focused on academic domains, but there will also be far, far more demand for professional domains as well across basically every trajectory or step-by-step problem that a knowledge worker solves in the workplace, it's the pursuit of these labs to make sure that they're trying to collect the data to help add as much value in that process for humans as possible. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:17):
So, let me ask you about this. There's this tension, I imagine, people might feel between all these students training models to become smarter, and smarter, and smarter, and then there's that they will have harder time potentially finding jobs if models are so smart that people at entry level aren't being hired as much. How do you think about just that tension? Do you think this is a real problem or not, or do you think this goes-

Garrett Lord (00:24:42):
I'm probably in the camp of like GDP growth over universal basic income. I very much believe that this is going to improve and accelerate every human's ability to create an impact in the economy in the world, and that we're hearing from, there's like a million companies that use Handshake. 100% of the Fortune 500 uses Handshake, so we basically power the vast majority of how young people find jobs, and a lot of people are hyperbolic at saying that all young people won't have jobs, and that's not what we're hearing from our employers. What we're hearing is pick social media marketing, before you needed somebody that could do Photoshop, and take pictures, and create the videos. Then you needed somebody that understood marketing analytics platforms to track your posting on different social media forms. It's like now one person, one young, talented, AI native, Iron Man suit enabled young person can get on and they can build their own videos, produce their own creative assets, post across multiple social media platforms, run all of their own analytics. They don't need a data science degree to be able to do that.

(00:25:47):
Or take an intern in our company, he had his first PR up I think the afternoon he started. You were a PM, you realize how challenging that would've been historically to get your dev environment set up and figure out where to add value. You just took a bug and squashed it. And so, I'm really a believer this is just enabling human beings to be even more productive and create more impact. And yeah, of course, hundreds of millions of jobs, the jobs will evolve. People will become displaced, they'll have to upscale and rescale, and I think Handshake has a huge role to play in helping knowledge workers evolve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
This has come up a couple of times this point that I think is really good, that younger people coming out of school are actually going to be much more likely to be successful because they're growing up with these tools, and are much more native to all these advanced tools and so they just come in as beasts just doing so much more.

Garrett Lord (00:26:42):
Well, do you remember when, this a little bit predates me, but you used to put Google search on as a skill on your resume. You were person, you were good at Googling, because you grew up with Google. It's like I think being AI native and having your Iron Man suit on, and understanding how to leverage these tools is like young people are at a huge advantage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:03):
Yeah. And especially if they're involved in training these models, I imagine there's some other cool advantage there. 

Garrett Lord (00:27:08):
Yeah. Well I mean, just to hit on that, what we're hearing from our thousands of fellows is they're in the classroom, they're actually producing research. We're talking about PhDs at the top institutions in the country. They can make 100, 150, $200 an hour in their area, in their field of expertise. It's pretty sweet. You can make 25 bucks an hour being a teacher's assistant, or you can actually make $150 an hour breaking the latest models, and what we're hearing from our fellows is they're bringing a lot of those insights into the classroom to help them be more effective at teaching. More importantly, they're starting to learn how to leverage these tools to actually advance their area of research. So, they believe that these tools can help them advance their area of research by helping them be more effective with their time. And so, it is quite cool to get paid to learn a skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):
Before I get to the story of how this all emerged, because that is an incredible story, is there anything else about this whole field of labeling, of reinforcement learning that you think people just don't fully understand or you think that is really important? There's just so much happening. Like I said, some of the fastest growing companies in the world are in the space, Scale was just acquired for 30, sort of acquired for $30 billion. Just what else is there, if there's anything, that you think people need to understand?

Garrett Lord (00:28:26):
Generally speaking, anytime that you're interacting with a model and you're asking it to do really advanced things, and it's not performing your expectations, like somewhere there's probably an expert that is the top mind in that domain working directly for the best researchers in the world at the Frontier Labs trying to understand and go through the scientific iteration process of how to make that better. And that the assumption there is that they already have the entirety of human knowledge that's written and recorded. And so, for as long as there are problems in solving any problem with AI, any human problem, there will need to be humans in the loop helping advance that. And models don't generalize. I mean, obviously the field will advance a lot and the type of data they'll collect will evolve a lot, but it's pretty exciting at the frontier. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):
Kevin Wheel was on the podcast, the CBO at OpenAI, and he made this point that really stuck with me that the model of today is the worst model you will ever use. 

Garrett Lord (00:29:29):
I love that line. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
Will only get better, just boggles the mind, and now we know why things are getting better because all the work you guys are doing. Just one quick question on this whole scale thing, I guess they were, I don't know, the main company doing this, now they're swallowed up and Alex is running superintelligence in Meta. Are they still a big player in this labeling space or are they out of it and that's a big opportunity?

Garrett Lord (00:29:50):
Yeah. I mean, kudos to the whole Scale team, a lot of respect for what they built, just many great companies operating the space. I think to the core of your question, I think if you viewed your research team and your model building team, and the experiments they're running to be really the cornerstone of how you're improving, you probably wouldn't want the latest research of what you're trying to work on being invested in by a peer. I mean, that's just generally what we hear in this space. And so, we have seen an incredible search and demand, and are I think extraordinarily well positioned. We like to say the only moat in human data is access to an audience. Basically, there are many, many small players in this space, some midsize players in the space, and they're basically running TikTok ads, running Instagram ads, paying money for Google Search display ads, YouTube ads, and they will be like, "Can you get me 200 physics PhDs?"

(00:30:58):
What do they do? They only can do one thing. They have 100 recruiters on staff, they all get on LinkedIn, they all send messages, they spend a couple million bucks on performance advertising campaigns. Somebody's scrolling their Instagram feed that's a physics PhD of which you can't target them that well and they like see, "Come train a model." It's like, "I've never heard of this brand before." The huge advantage that we've had and why we've resonated so fast in the marketplace is we built a decade of trust with 18 million people, and they trust us, and we built a ton of brand affinity, and they use Handshake, and they have an active profile, and we have a ton of information around their academic performance and what they've done in school. And so, we're able to really target people really effectively, and get to scale and volume of high quality data faster than anyone else. And I think that competitive advantage of access to an audience is really resonating in the marketplace. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):
Today's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your user research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment results and competitive intel? Claude can handle incredibly complex multistep work. You can throw a 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. 

(00:32:53):
If you want to try it out, get started at Claude.ai/Lenny, and using this link you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's Claude.ai/Lenny. 

(00:33:06):
Okay, this is an awesome segue to where I wanted to go, which is just how this business emerged. This is a business that you built on top of a business you've already had. From what I understand, you were at like $150 million in revenue, you've been at this for a long time. You found this opportunity, and now that looking back it's like obviously this is an amazing idea, labs need data, you guys have the supply of incredible experts. What an opportunity. Talk about just how you first realized this was something that you could be doing, and should be doing, and then how you started to execute down this path.

Garrett Lord (00:33:40):
Yeah, I think it's been a pretty natural extension from helping people jumpstart, restart or start their career. Monetizing your skills and this new employment ecosystem is going to look very different in the future, and to zoom into how we discovered it, it's like because we have such a large access to this audience, and as the world shifted from generalists to experts, we're the largest expert network in the world. We have more PhDs, 500,000 of them use Handshake than any other platform. We have three million master students who are in school or alumni. And so, we started to see all what I would call middleman companies reaching out to us saying, "Can we recruit your PhDs and master's students?" And like any great marketplace we started sending them to these different platforms, and started to really realize that from hearing from our users that the experience was really frustrating. 

(00:34:38):
Training was very transactional, it was very amorphous how you could get paid. There was immense amount of drop-off in the process to actual project like completion on these other platforms. So, we started to think the company was making tens of millions of dollars from helping these other platforms, and we started to realize what really kicked it off was hearing also from the Frontier Labs, they started to reach out to us and started to go direct and trying to almost cut out the middleman. And we started to realize, well, we could really serve our fellows, our PhDs, our experts, we could treat them. We just believe there will need to be a platform, an experts first platform in the pursuit of ASI and advancing AI, and there will need to be a place that everyone in the world could go to, to monetize their skills and their knowledge as these labs are focused on improving in all these multidisciplinary. And yeah, we entered the business in, really I started doing it over Christmas and New Year's. That's when I started flying around.

(00:35:48):
My family thought it was a little wild that I was on planes trying to chase different leaders, but we built an incredible team of people that came from the human data world, and really started building out our platform in January, and then started really monetizing the relationships about five months ago. Fast-forward to today, we're working with seven of the Frontier Labs, basically every lab that's doing work and building the best large language models, and the team has exploded and revenue's exploded, and it's been really a incredible ride running back new company inside of a company for the second time over again. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):
And just to share some numbers, tell me if this is correct or if you're sharing these, but I heard that you hit 50 million in revenue just four months into this? Today we're at eight months in and you're on track to hit $100 million in revenue in the first year.

Garrett Lord (00:36:43):
I think we'll blow through that number, but yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:44):
Okay. Incredible. And I didn't even know there were seven Frontier Labs, that's-

Garrett Lord (00:36:49):
Zero to 50 is pretty good in four months, I think. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:51):
Think zero to 50 million in four months, that's something. It's like the bar has been shifting constantly. A year ago that'd be legendary. Now it's like, all right, well another one of these. 50 million in four months, no big deal. It's truly insane. Just to zoom out one second, for people that don't know a ton about Handshake, the original business, what was that? What was actually this network that you had, that you sat on top of?

Garrett Lord (00:37:18):
Yeah, that network does about 200 million. This will do about [inaudible 00:37:21]

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:18):
200 million.

Garrett Lord (00:37:18):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:18):
Okay. 

Garrett Lord (00:37:20):
So, we have 600-ish super passionate teammates that work on the core business, which I would separate those. These aren't two businesses, I think it's one business, but what is that business? If you're a young person in America that's graduated in the last five, six, seven, eight years, you probably have Handshake on your phone. You definitely know what Handshake is. It's a verb with young people in America, it's a verb with people that are in college in their PhD or master's program, and it is, I call it an unconnected graph, meaning you don't need to ... LinkedIn is very focused on who you know and what your experience is. The first question on LinkedIn is what's your job? And a lot of young people start off, they've never had a job before. They don't have 500 connections to add to their graph. 

(00:38:13):
Whereas on Handshake, you start off trying to discover, and explore, and figure out how to navigate through school and figure out, "Oh, I'm an engineer. Maybe I want to be a PM, maybe I want to work at a startup, maybe I want to go to a larger company." What are the pros and cons you want to learn from your peers and young alumni? And so, Handshake's this I call a very social platform with groups, and messaging, and profiles, and short-form video and feed, all focused on your interests and helping really build your confidence in your early career to find your first job, your second job, and to manage 18 to 30, I would say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:49):
And how long has that business been around? 

Garrett Lord (00:38:51):
It's been around 10 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):
10 years, okay. So it's just again, it just feels like such a holy shit, you guys are in the right place in the right time with the right network that is extremely valuable now. What an interesting story. I feel like it's just another interesting example of you've been doing something for a long time and then all of a sudden AI is just, opens up a whole new way of leveraging something that you have been doing for a long time. It makes me think a little better about Bolt, and StackBlitz, which was building for seven years this browser based OS where you could run an OS in the browser. And they're like, "I don't know, no one needs this. What are we doing?" And then, all of a sudden AI and they're like, "Oh, what if we build AI apps in the browser and just generate products for you with AI?" And now it's, I don't know, one of the fastest growing companies in the world. 

Garrett Lord (00:39:36):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):
So interesting. And so, I think this is just an interesting time for our people to think about what have we done that may give us a new opportunity to build something huge based on this unfair advantage that we have?

Garrett Lord (00:39:49):
I think also as your company grows in size and headcount, and maturity, it's also hard to incubate something new inside of a business. It's hard in so many ways. The way that you build zero to one, and find product market fit, and scale a team very quickly and is very different than the way that you run a more mature business that has been around for 10 years with hundreds, and hundreds, and hundreds of people. So, I've really had a ton of fun and found a ton of passion in running it back again for the second time inside the business. And then yeah, we have this massive strategic advantage, which is no cost or acquisition costs, and we have much higher conversion rates and retention than any of the other platforms by a large margin because we have such consumer affinity. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:43):
There's actually two threads here I want to follow, I'm going to follow the second one first, this idea of where this data labeling work can come from. This isn't a really clear, simple, understandable one, which is just experts sitting there creating data. Another one that I know a lot of other companies in this space use Scale, I know especially with just like low-cost labor internationally. Are there other methods for doing this that isn't one of those two? How are other companies doing this?

Garrett Lord (00:41:10):
I think if you care about building a really high quality business, and having good gross margin and high quality growth, the ecosystem here is, one of the leading players, they have 200 recruiters. It's unsustainable. There are like 200 people on LinkedIn sending individual messages to acquire these people, because there's no brand, there's no trust. They're spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance advertising, Google Ads-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:39):
To find experts and to find folks. 

Garrett Lord (00:41:41):
Find experts. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):
And it's experts mostly at this point. 

Garrett Lord (00:41:43):
Yeah. And then they put them onto an experience that is treating them like they're drawing boundary boxes around stop signs in the Philippines. The frontier tax accountants don't want to be treated like low cost international labor, and I don't think anyone enjoys that process. And so, the ability to build a experience that's rooted in community, that's rooted in high quality training. If you're getting your PhD at MIT, chances are you're just not being taught well enough on how to use the tools.

(00:42:15):
It's not you can't break the models, it's just like the other platforms, they're spending thousands of hours to acquire an individual user and they're put right into a project with no training. So, we just started from day one at building this expert ... We believe there'd be a deep network effect here that's very connected to our core business of starting, jumpstarting or restarting your career. And you come in, you build a profile, you see the community, there's groups and a feed of here's how people are learning. You come into actual individual cohort with peers that look like you and have your similar background. You're being taught on how to interact, and there's a trial and error, and we have an instructional design piece so you can't do it. Then you're put on the projects where building ... There's certain swim lanes where we're actually pre-building data and selling that data to all the labs. 

(00:43:03):
So, we can do this thing where we produce one unit of data ourselves. We pay for it, almost like a movie production. We pay for a unit of data, and then we make sure it's very high quality. We run our own post-training on it, and then we produce a bunch of specifications of the data, and we actually sell that individual package of data to many different labs. And so, you get put on a project like that. Once you're doing a really, really good job on our projects, oftentimes then we'll put you on customer projects where they only want the best of the best people in machine learning. And then they go from our projects to their projects. And so, there's a huge customer acquisition. You love going deep on your podcast, so just to talk about it, it's like you really have a couple of things that matter.

(00:43:46):
You have a cost to customer acquisition, your CAC, and then you have your LTV, like the lifetime value of a user. And an LTV is calculated pretty simply in this business. It is based on the retention of a person, and how many projects they can participate in. So, if you treat people really well, you train them really well, well, A, we have no customer acquisition costs because we partner with 1,600 universities, power 92% of the top 500 schools in the country. We power almost every institution and community college in the country. We have no customer acquisition cost to acquire the people. We have a ton of brand and trust with them built up, so they convert at really, really high rates. And then, if you treat them really well, because what they expect from us, they know Handshake, their school buys Handshake, we care about treating these people well but the universities would not tolerate our partnership with these fellows unless we treated them well. 

(00:44:41):
So, you put them into this process where our LTVs and repeat engagement rate and retention rate on different projects is really high. And so, these structural advantages are quite significant when you contrast a leading provider that has 200 individual contributing recruiters, and are spending tens of millions of dollars a month on performance marketing. So, that's I think why we've seen so much success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):
That's extremely interesting. And it feels like, as you said, there used to be a big focus on generalists, which is people anywhere in the world for low-cost can do the work, like draw bounding boxes around things. And essentially the market has shifted from low-cost generalists to experts. And a lot of these companies like Scale, we're optimizing for general work model training data, and you guys are set up to be extremely good at expert based data. And so, you're in the right place at the right time, at the right supply. What a business.

Garrett Lord (00:45:43):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
Nice work.

Garrett Lord (00:45:44):
I would say it's not been easy building business two inside of business one, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:48):
Yeah. So, let me follow that thread. That's where I wanted to go. What was just that like? So, you started noticing that model companies were coming to your people, that people were having hard times with some of these other companies in this space and you're like, "Oh, maybe we should be doing this sort of thing"? How did that just initial inception start, and how did you start to explore that idea and to see if it was a real thing?

Garrett Lord (00:46:09):
Tactically we were working with many of the middleman companies doing work. We started to see the demand, as I talked about earlier. We started to see direct outreach from the Frontier Labs reaching out to us, trying to cut out the middleman in their pursuit of getting higher-quality data. When we started to put together the dots on we could build a way better experience for our fellows, we could serve them directly to the labs and build a direct customer relationship with the labs, and basically cut out the middleman. And provide a better experience to the labs, provide a better experience to our fellows and provide a better experience to our million companies in the network.

(00:46:48):
And you might think about just upskilling and reskilling, what's going to happen there. So, we walked into this space. We started in really December, exploring and learning more about it, like on expert calls and hammering down. I hired three expert firms, AlphaSights and GLG, and started doing a bunch of calls with the latest researchers, because we had resources. One of the cool things about being a larger company is our core business is $200 million ARR, so it's like we had resources to be able to accelerate the learning curve here. And then, we started working with arguably the number one lab about five months ago. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):
I wonder who that is. 

Garrett Lord (00:47:35):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:35):
Yeah, wonder who it is. 

Garrett Lord (00:47:39):
[inaudible 00:47:39] different answers working with the number one lab, and have just now we're working with Devin on the Frontier Labs and the number one thing we're trying to do is just focus on scaling up. And we've gone from four or five people working on this to 75 plus people working on it. I think we had 12 people start last Monday. It's like we are so bottlenecked on just meeting this opportunity, because in this market there's essentially unlimited demand. If you can produce high quality volumes of data, you most likely will be able to sell whatever you produce. And so on our side, it's like we're really focused on making sure that we pick the right longer term strategy, making sure that we don't grow too fast as to erode the trust that we've built up with these Frontier labs. Yeah, but it's been fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:38):
You said it's also been really hard to start those business within an existing business. What's been hard? What's been hardest? You touched on a couple of these elements already, but what else? 

Garrett Lord (00:48:50):
I think I just followed a lot more of my intuition around this, doing this. The story of Handshake was we had to sign up 1,600 universities, so I had to learn how to be the best ... We are the fastest growing higher education company in history. So, we signed up six 1,600 schools. Then we had to build an employer business, where we had to figure out how to sell the 100% ... All these Fortune 500 companies use it and 70% of it pay for it, so I had to learn about upmarket sales to Goldman Sachs, and General Motors, and Google and the biggest companies in the world, which is totally different than selling universities. And then we had to learn how to build an incredible student social network. What does the best feed look like? What does group messaging look like? So, I felt a little bit of familiarity in those zero to ones. 

(00:49:39):
Oftentimes marketplaces are like many zero to ones. Sometimes I dream that we just, I actually don't dream, but I make a joke that I just wish we were a cybersecurity company and we had one buyer and just one product, and it was just like we had to ... In a marketplace, you have to serve three different sides, you know from your time at Airbnb. And so, one of my learnings in spinning up these three different businesses in starting Handshake was I was pretty hands-on. So, everyone reported directly to me. I really said in a lot of meetings, "I'm not trying to be the boss, I'm just trying to get another smart guy in the room." We've hired an incredible team of people that have spent a lot of time in the space and have been big leaders at a lot of the human data companies in the space.

(00:50:27):
And so, everyone saw very clearly the structural advantages that we had, and a lot of the focus was on making sure that we could deliver high-quality data to one customer before we expand to anyone else. You had to say no to a lot of things. And then, you also had a lot of people in the core part of the business that, rightfully so, there's just checks and balances that there's a lot of people that try to get involved. Everyone wants to say, not everyone, this is a stretch, but it's easy to say no. It's easy to be like, "I can't prioritize that this week or this month. I have an existing set of priorities." So essentially, with the exception of a few things, everyone just came straight into this new org that I built, everyone did not have any responsibilities in the existing part of the business. It was extremely clear who was the directly responsible individual across each area of the new co. And now we've got deeper coupling and integration points across the rest of the business, but we sat in a separate part of the office. 

(00:51:35):
Everyone's in the office five days a week, a lot of weekends. There's a totally different expectation in hiring talent too, where it's like, "Hey, this is a 24/7 job. This is an early-stage company." The compensation was also different too, and based on hurdles in this new business so people felt owners creating the new co. And yeah, it's still extremely nimble, very, very flat. Just because you run one function doesn't mean you're the directly responsible individual on a project. We pick the best person who's most capable of driving an initiative forward, regardless of the function to be the DRI. We're a lot more metrics-oriented. When I built Handshake, we resisted this operating cadence for a long time, this weekly, monthly, quarterly operating cadence. With Handshake AI, we've been way more focused on operating with data, and metrics, and rigor from an early stage. There's a gentleman named Sahil on our team who's been doing an incredible job with that. Shout out Sahil, shout out young, shout out Paco. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:42):
Okay, this is incredible. So, a few elements of what allowed this to succeed within a decade-old company. And by the way, so you're at 200 million a year in revenue with the traditional business. You're going to, as you said, blow past 100 million in the first year of this new business. So, it's wild that in the first couple years, if things continue to go this way, you'll exceed the run rate of a business that took you 10 years to build. Incredible. To make this successful, a few of the things I noted as you were talking, one is clearly you were just in founder mode. You're the lead of this new business. You weren't delegating it to someone, "Hey, go start this thing." You dedicated people, "Here, we're going to pick people. You have nothing else going on, this is your new job. You're going to work on this stuff." 

(00:53:28):
You worked in different part of the office. There's a metrics-based cadence. It's just like, let's stay really diligent about here's how it's going, here's where we're going, here's our track, here's our KPIs, things like that. Anything else there that you felt really important to making this work? Because a lot of companies are going to try to do this, I imagine, and so I'm curious what else you found important to make this work.

Garrett Lord (00:53:50):
Yeah. I mean, I just really believe in separate and everything. Separate engineering team, separate design team, separate accounts and operations team, separate finance team. Early on, everything was separate. People only had one job and one job only, and that was making Handshake AI successful. We had a couple integration points more, and I had an incredible executive team and a core part of business, and now there's becoming more and more involvement. But our executives that have built Handshake for a long time ran the core business, and I focused 80 plus percent of my time and attention on just this. And we hired an incredible engineering leader like Avery, who ... We have a lot of entrepreneurs, people that have started companies inside the company. Or pardon me, people that started companies before. That was huge. A lot of familiarity with hiring talent that have only worked at early stage companies so [inaudible 00:54:44] that feels super comfortable with ambiguity. 

(00:54:46):
We were also way more upfront around this is going to be chaotic. Just owning that narrative in front of all hands at the core company, owning it directly with the team. We have a separate all hands, we have separate onboarding, we have a separate recruiting team. I had some connection points, but mostly separate. And I think that was absolutely critical. We took some of the top people, I mean, we have great people in the core business, we took some great people from the core businesses and basically said, "Sorry, I know you love your old team. I know you love what you're doing. Will you join us in Handshake AI?" And they completely forego their historical responsibilities and came over. That became really critical with engineering when things started to scale and topple, and we're growing so quickly we took some of our top senior engineers, who were very entrepreneurial, and principal engineers, staff of engineers, parachute them in. It's been awesome to ask some of the most talented people in the core business like, "Hey, do you want to come over here and do this?"

(00:55:49):
And sometimes they say no. They're like, "I don't want to work most of the weekends." The number of 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM nights we done in this business, I mean, it's quite regular. People sometimes don't want to commit to that, but we've been up front, like here are the expectations for this team. It's an insane pace. If you want to be a part of one of the fastest growing businesses in Silicon Valley, you can join it. The ownership too has also been huge, like owning this outcome, and we have this motto to leave nothing to chance. For a while there we drew the number of days in the year on the whiteboard and it was like, there will never be a time like this. I've never seen anything like it, I doubt I'll ever feel anything like this in business again where there's unlimited demand and it's just our ability to execute against it.

(00:56:39):
And so, we had this motto like leave nothing to chance. How do you make sure that three months are not six months? You have no regrets. Get on the plane to go talk to a customer, make the late night push, check the data six times over again, ship the extra feature that helps. And really, a huge celebratory culture too. It's very flat so there really isn't this principle of ... There's so many people putting up points, directly calling out the people that are putting up points and creating a really fun environment around impact I think has been awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:14):
The leave nothing to chance piece I imagine speaks partly to the value of trust in what you're doing. You win if they can trust that your data's awesome, and great, and consistent, and I could see why that ends up being such an important part of what you're building. And just listening to you describe this, I understand it's obviously a massive opportunity, obviously a massive advantage you guys have, and just the stress that comes with that burden also imagine is very high of just like we can't screw this up.

Garrett Lord (00:57:44):
No. Yes, Handshake should be a ... Business does billions dollars revenue as a public company, we should be able to continue to ... I mean, and it also helps our core business. The longer term opportunity that we see is it's connecting, it's building the best job mashing marketplace on the internet. It's probably one of the largest problems in the world like labor supply mashing. It's where people spend most of their time and energy, just hours of their life they spend it at work. The process of searching for a job, applying to a job is going to be completely reinvented with AI. We've been leading the charge there. An AI interviewer that's collecting skills and actually asking about your experiences, doing work simulation experiences that help employers find the best candidates. I mean, I don't know the last time you've done this, but the hiring manager process, reviewing 200 resumes, are you kidding me? 

(00:58:49):
I'm going to sit there and review 200 resumes? Not a chance five years from now. Students manually making cover ... Not a chance. So, there will need to be a marketplace that wins in connecting supply and demand, and talent with opportunity, and we think and get psyched about the opportunity for impact here. That's my story, I went to community college, I paid my way through school. I went to a no name school in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I worked at Palantir as an intern, it totally changed my life, and I started Handshake because I wanted to make it easier for anyone regardless of who you knew, what your parents did, what school you went to, to find a great opportunity. And I think AI, totally step function improvement in matching. And I think that our human data business is really serving as the foundation for improving matching. 

(00:59:44):
A lot of things that we're doing in the human data business are being integrated to our core business. I think that's going to improve outcomes for employers, save them in the aggregate like billions of dollars over time. And I think it makes the experience way better for students. So, it's just like we have to meet the moment. We still have the stamina, and the excitement, and the passion internally in our core and in the new business to go charge after this. And that's a lot of the message we've been sharing internally is it's time to amp it up. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be positioned as well, and we are going to make the moment as a team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:19):
It really is. This very much feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity. Let me ask a few other questions along these lines that are something I've been thinking about, something that a lot of people think about, just while I have you, there's always this question of will we run out of data? Will model stop advancing? Are we going to hit some plateau and there's not actually going to be some AGI moment, SGI moment? So first of all, do you think we'll run out of data? There's a point at which we just can't produce more knowledge and data to feed these models? And along those lines, what do you think is the biggest bottleneck to advancing models faster and further?

Garrett Lord (01:00:50):
Yeah, I mean, it's just the type of data we're going to need is going to evolve. It's going to be CAD files, it's going to be scientific tool use data as they try to automate scientific discoveries and drug discovery. It's going to be esoteric operating systems that exist on scientific tools. So, I love this trajectory and stitching together step-by-step instruction following. The type of data we're going to need is going to evolve a lot. And we haven't even talked about multimodal, and video, and text and audio. There's a huge demand for audio data right now. So, the type of data's going to evolve.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:38):
Yeah, I use voice mode all the time. That's on my default ChatGPT experience, just talking to-

Garrett Lord (01:01:42):
It's amazing. It's amazing. I just had a baby on, or my wife had a baby on Sunday, and voice mode's been incredible. I mean, every night, every two hours it's like I have more questions. Voice mode's been huge. So, shot out voice mode. Yeah, so the type of data is going to collect a lot, or change a lot. I think synthetic data has a role to play and in verifiable domains, but what we consistently hear from companies it's like synthetic data is not going to dominate. There's billions, and billions, and billions of dollars of value to extract as a company over the next decade and following the frontier of AI development.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):
Let me first say just huge kudos to you for just having a kid, your wife just having a kid a few days ago, and building this business that is growing bananas and doing this podcast conversation. I really appreciate you. 

Garrett Lord (01:02:35):
Thank you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
Of course. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think might be helpful for folks to hear, or a part of your story that you think might be helpful for folks to learn from, or something you may want to just double down on that we've talked about before we get to a very exciting lightning round? 

Garrett Lord (01:02:52):
I mean, the thing I always love talking, I'm really passionate about people starting companies and helping them do so. I just think in this moment right now with AI, for young entrepreneurs that listen, that read this podcast, because I've been a reader since 2020. We looked. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:07):
Yeah, we did check. That's incredible. 

Garrett Lord (01:03:08):
Yeah, been a long-term reader. I'm just so curious and love sucking up-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:08):
Appreciate it. 

Garrett Lord (01:03:11):
... your interviews. But it's like you just focus on doing something of meaning that really helps people. And I think with AI, there's going to be so many opportunities to improve the way people learn. I'm just really passionate about trying to make Handshake a platform that is not only an incredible business, but is also something that really helps solve a societal problem that matters. And yeah, that's be my one shout out here. If anyone wants advice on how to do that or wants to reach out, I'm happy to chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):
Okay, so this is an offer to share advice on starting companies within AI. Is that the offer here? Just so folks-

Garrett Lord (01:03:50):
Yeah, that'd be great. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:50):
Okay. I don't know how much time you'll have for the hundreds of thousands of people coming your way, but I appreciate the offer. That's very cool. Anything else before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Garrett Lord (01:04:00):
No. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:02):
Well, with that Garrett, we reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Garrett Lord (01:04:06):
Ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Garrett Lord (01:04:11):
I'm a sucker for Peter Thiel's Zero to One. I read it when I started the company, and watched Peter Thiel's startup school class at Stanford he taught back in the days where there wasn't everything written on the internet about how to start companies, and just think he was the coolest. Love Shoe Dog. I think it's the epitome of starting a company. Hard Things About Hard Things obviously, but these are all quite common books.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):
But also classics. Ben Horowitz is coming on the podcast, talk about Hard Things About Hard Things. 

Garrett Lord (01:04:42):
Super cool. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:43):
The Hard Thing About Hard Things. Yeah. Okay, have you seen a recent movie or TV show you really enjoy it? I imagine you don't have much time for this, but-

Garrett Lord (01:04:49):
I'm going to get blasted for this, but I did start Game of Thrones with my wife, and I cannot-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:55):
For the first time. 

Garrett Lord (01:04:56):
Yeah. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Okay, cool. 

Garrett Lord (01:04:57):
So, I got a lot of catching up to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:59):
Why would you get ... No, this is great. It's like people that have watched it-

Garrett Lord (01:04:59):
I've loved it so far. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):
You've loved it so far? Okay. It's quite gruesome, that's the only downside of that show. Don't watch it before you go to bed, I don't know how many gruesome scenes you've seen already. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? 

Garrett Lord (01:05:14):
The SNOO. The baby automated SNOO has really helped us a lot. So love the, shout-out SNOO team. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):
Amazing. I had a SNOO as well. We never actually turned it on, we just ended up using it as a basinet the whole time. 

Garrett Lord (01:05:28):
Yeah, most of the time it's not turned on, but a couple of cries it's been turned on, it's been very helpful. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
Do you have favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with other people?

Garrett Lord (01:05:37):
I love that leave nothing to chance, leave it all out on the field. Grew up in a really hardworking family, and dad worked really hard to provide, make it happen for us and it's like just give it your all. Leave nothing a chance.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Okay. So the last question, I was researching you in prep for this podcast and there's a story that I love about your hustle early on is when you were going from campus to campus pitching schools to join Handshake, and there's a story where you had to shower in the Princeton's pool to save money because you just didn't have a place to stay. Is there something there? Is there a story there you could share?

Garrett Lord (01:06:13):
Yeah, so it was a tough one. I mean, I almost got arrested at Princeton, because I mean, I guess for entrepreneurs that are traveling around all the time, we were sleeping out of our car. We had this Ford focus, we would put 20, 30,000 miles on it, sleep in the back of like McDonald's parking lots because they're well lit and had good wifi back in the day. And instead of staying in a hotel, a way to freshen up ahead of your meeting is every university has a pool and the pool's almost always, it is always open. We never had a situation where it's always open for people to swim in the morning, like fitness. Faculty, students. And every pool, what do they have? They have a shower. 

(01:06:49):
So, you could go to any pool at any university in the country, and you can get a free shower and freshen up. So, the Princeton campus security did not appreciate me showering as a non-student, but I think it meaningfully helped us because the Princeton campus security called the career service center director we were selling to, being like, "Who's Garrett Lord? Is he really here to pitch you software for your career center?" And it made the start of the meeting with the career center really stimulating and exciting, because they were like, "You showered in our pool, you drove here?" "Yeah, we drove here from Michigan." And so, I think that showed a level of commitment that was exciting for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
Fast-forward to all these founders now starting to use this growth lever of getting in trouble with the campus police to get better meetings with the school leaders. Incredible. Garrett, this is such an insane, amazing, inspiring story, just like what you're building and the opportunity here, and just how it's fast, it's going, and all the advantages you have. If I was an investor in Handshake, I'd be like, "All right, 10 years, it's going great." And now it's like, "Whoa, holy shit. Where did this come from?" Incredible. And it's just also really meaningful. So, I'm really happy that you made time for this in spite of the madness you are in right now. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to maybe reach out or maybe if you're hiring, let us know. And then, how can listeners be useful to you?

Garrett Lord (01:08:12):
I mean, sign up for Handshake. If you want to message me on there, it's the easiest way to reach me. Just find me at garrettlord@Handshake, and you find me on Twitter. Love X, huge X guy. You can email me at garrett@joinhandshake.com and double R, double T. And how can you be helpful? We are trying to hire so many people. We have offices in New York and in San Francisco, and London and Berlin. If you have friends that are maybe passionate about this, you let them know, or you're interested in the learning more, please reach out. We'd love to talk to you. Hiring is like the number one problem we have right now to meet the demand. So, if you're talented and interested in learning more about Handshake, if you want to work on our consumer product, if you want to work on our employer products, cool PLG issues or the state-of-the-art consumer social experience, like reach out, or you want to work on the AI business we'd love to talk to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:06):
To make it even more clear for folks, what roles are you most hiring for? Is it every role? Is it engineering? 

Garrett Lord (01:09:11):
Engineers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Engineering, all right. If you're an engineer and want to join one of the fastest growing AI companies in the world right now, here we go. We'll link to your careers page in the show notes. 

Garrett Lord (01:09:18):
Thank you. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):
Yeah, of course. Garrett, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.

Garrett Lord (01:09:22):
Of course. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:24):

# Leaving big tech to build the #1 technology newsletter | Gergely Orosz (The Pragmatic Engineer)

## Transcript

Gergely Orosz (00:00:00):
In my best year at Uber, I made about 320 or $330,000 in total compensation. And when I quit my job, I was actually thinking, am I crazy? Because I am leaving... Especially in Europe, this is a lot of money [inaudible 00:00:14] this will be similar to something... Someone in a similar position would've made five or 600K in total in the U.S. But now I am making more in compensation that I made at Uber. And the difference is that now my compensation... Well, my earnings keep going up as long as the newsletter is growing, so there's no theoretical cap on this. Of course there's an actual cap, there's churn, growth is slowing over time. But it's very, very strange, because I felt that I was in a really privileged position, just honestly making tons of money, doing a job that I loved. And this was at Uber or as a software engineer. And I'm now doing stuff that I love, and in some strange way, I guess it even pays better.

Lenny (00:00:59):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Gergely Orosz. In a sense, Gergely is the me of engineering. He's got the top engineering newsletter on Substack, it's growing really fast, and like me, he does this full time. In this episode, we talk about the life of newslettering full time, like we both do. We get into Gergely's decision to leave his cushy tech job at Uber, to go into this life full-time, what the day-to-day life of a newsletter person is, the pros and cons of this life, what it takes to be successful, and a bunch of advice for how to get started if you're curious about going down this route. This is a pretty unique episode, and it was really fun to do. If you ever thought about writing or going down this creator route, you'll love this episode. With that, I bring you Gergely Orosz.

Lenny (00:02:06):

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify and Tenfold and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by [inaudible 00:03:56]. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10x your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:04:28):
Gergely, welcome to the podcast.

Gergely Orosz (00:04:35):
It's awesome. Great to be here, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:36):
So I think this is going to be a pretty special and unique podcast. Your newsletter is the number one technology newsletter on Substack, called the Pragmatic Engineer, by the way. My newsletter is the number one business newsletter on Substack, and so we're connected in this really special, weird way, and I thought it would be pretty fun to just explore this weird path that we're on doing this newsletter thing, and in that, help listeners understand the pros and cons of this life, how to go down this route, what it takes to be successful, all that stuff. But before we get into all that, I'd love for you to spend maybe a minute just giving us a little overview of your career, and how you got to where you are today doing this newsletter, and what you spend your time on now.

Gergely Orosz (00:05:19):
My career started out as what you might consider a pretty typical software engineer career. I graduated from university, I did a computer science degree for a five year program, so I did bachelor's and master's. I worked on the side, I hacked around, built small websites here and there, and during university I worked at a small web agency. And then I worked my way up in the industry. So I started off at a consulting company, we were just building for other companies. I'm originally from Hungary, in Europe. I then moved to UK, which was a big step up for me in terms of just getting access to, I guess, more modern software development. I was at a consulting company there as well. And I moved up to London, which in Europe, I feel it's like the New York of Europe, or even the Silicon Valley, back in the day. Back before Brexit, it was the biggest tech hub.

Gergely Orosz (00:06:11):
I worked at an investment bank there, and then on the side I was always building mobile apps, and I got into Skype. I like to say Skype, but it was Microsoft. They just bought Skype at that point, and it was a lot more startup-y environment, a lot more fast moving. I then moved to another startup where I was a founding engineer of a acquisition. It's a startup called Skyscanner. And then I ended up at Uber at Amsterdam, where I joined as a senior software engineer, and I became a manager, and then a manager of managers, and it was just... I feel, looking back at that part of my career, I just felt really growing all the time, just taking each step one step at a time, which gave me a lot of appreciation for all these levels.

Gergely Orosz (00:06:51):
And then, just as I was on this really good career path, I was on the path to being a senior engineering manager, or who knows, one day I might have had a shot of being their director of engineering as well, I decided to leave Uber. And we'll talk about it a little later in the podcast, but I didn't plan like this, but I started writing a newsletter. And now here I am writing a newsletter where a bunch of people are reading it, and it's a really unexpected turn and a really cool life as well.

Lenny (00:07:19):
Awesome. On the newsletter, just to give people a little bit of context of how big this has gotten, can you share just a couple stats about the growth of the newsletter, the size, and anything else you want to share there?

Gergely Orosz (00:07:30):
Just today I checked and it said 189,000 subscribers. I think the past 90 days has been growing with 80,000 subscribers, so it's almost a thousand people per day, which is incredible. Because these numbers are huge. If you're listening, you're probably thinking, "Wow." And that's how I feel every day as well. But I've been writing a blog for many, many years, and these are numbers I never thought it would be. And the growth just seems to be accelerating. There was a tipping point in April where the newsletter was growing... In the first about nine months of the newsletter, it got to 50,000 subscribers, and then the next five months, or six or seven months, it went up by another a hundred and something thousand subscribers. This was when Substack introduced recommendations, which has been a massive growth engine, and I guess being one of the top publications, I benefited from it. But those numbers are again...

Gergely Orosz (00:08:26):
So this is a paid newsletter as well. So there's a free version and a paid version, and there's thousands of people paying for the newsletter. It's a single digit percentage, but it's a very, very healthy one. And again, it just beat all my expectations. And I guess we're in similar boats, because our newsletter setup, yours and mine, is somewhat similar. We have plenty of differences as well, but I make most of my revenue from subscriptions, and I don't do sponsorships or ads in the newsletter. So if people sign up for the free one, they get articles every now and then, and for the paid one, they get it a lot more and in more depth.

Lenny (00:08:59):
Can you give listeners a sense of just the order of magnitude income you make from this, versus your cushy tech job at Uber? You don't have to share numbers or anything like that.

Gergely Orosz (00:09:09):
Yeah. I'll share a little numbers of my cushy tech job at Uber. I was in Europe, and European tech salaries, or I'll say total compensation, will be lower than for example the U.S., but it'll be higher than let's say regions like India or Indonesia. There's regional differences, and this is true for big tech as well. Uber was a good example on this. But in my best year at Uber, I made about 320 or $330,000 in total compensation. This was after Uber went public, so it includes the stock, the base salary, the bonus, which was very, very good in Europe. And when I quit my job, I was actually thinking, "Am I crazy? Because I'm leaving..." Especially in Europe, this is a lot of money [inaudible 00:09:53] this will be similar to something... Someone in a similar position would've made five or 600 K in total in the U.S.

Gergely Orosz (00:10:00):
So I walked away from that, and I was pretty sure that I'll just [inaudible 00:10:04] a lot less, but I'll enjoy what I'm doing, or I'll have... I'll just give it a go. But now I am making more in compensation that I made at Uber. And the difference is that now my compensation, my earnings, keep going up as long as the newsletter is growing, so there's no theoretical cap on this. Of course there is an actual cap, there's churn, growth is slowing over time, but it's very, very strange, because I felt that I was in a really privileged position, just honestly making tons of money, doing a job that I loved. And this was at Uber or as a software engineer. And I'm now doing stuff that I love, and in some strange way, I guess it even pays better. Part of it is just luck, part of this is situational. I think we're going to talk a bit more about this. But this was very, very surprising and very unexpected for me.

Lenny (00:10:55):
Awesome. That's a great segue to the first thing I want to talk about, but just to frame what I want to spend our time on today, there's these four areas I want to explore. One is your decision to leave and start this life of writing, which is a very non-traditional life. Two is what the life of a paid newsletter person is like. What do you do all day? How do you find time to do this? How do you produce so much content? Three, what it takes to be successful at this. A lot of people... I always say it's easy to start a newsletter, hard to keep it going, and I'm curious what you find is important to be successful. And then four, how do you get started if you want to start your own newsletter?

Lenny (00:11:30):
But before I get into that, I just wanted to add a thought that I had. The way I think about this life in terms of comparing to the old job is, one, it feels instead of one boss, I have thousands of micro bosses, and one of them can fire me and many do every day, but it feels safer than at a tech job where one person can decide. And then the other piece is, assuming it keeps growing, you're getting a raise almost every day, every week, depending on the growth rate, and that's cool.

Gergely Orosz (00:11:57):
That is really cool. I had a spreadsheet that I maintained for the first year of the publication, where I listed, for every article, how much did my annual revenue go up a week later. So tracking what was the impact. And the crazy thing was that, when I wrote a really good article that resonated with people, sometimes it was an article that I thought was mediocre and people still loved it [inaudible 00:12:20] it was a really good article that I put tons of work in, I saw myself getting a raise. And this is just something you just don't get in corporate. I mean, it's by design, and there's a lot of good stuff about it, but I feel that this life, and we'll touch more on this, but there's a lot of surprising things, both good and bad, but this is a really good one. So for doing something awesome, you can just give yourself a raise, especially because this is just like you, mine is also a one person business right now.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Yeah. Okay. So you're at Uber, you're making hundreds of thousands of dollars writing code, it's pretty sweet. Uber's growing. You probably got all these RSUs that are going to keep accumulating. It's pretty good. And you decide, "I'm going to try to make money on the internet writing," which is an obvious way to make a lot of money. Not. And so I'm curious, what got you to leave that job and explore writing and get to this writing path?

Gergely Orosz (00:13:20):
The short of it is, it was a promise to myself, and COVID, and Uber doing layoffs. And the longer version is that, when I joined Uber, before Uber I was... Now we're talking numbers on my old job, but I was working in London as a principal engineer at Skyscanner. Skyscanner was a unicorn, one of the few unicorns in the UK, UK headquartered and all that, and I was making like 90-something thousand pounds in base salary, which is maybe a 120, 130, or $140,000, depends on how the pound is doing, or sometimes these days it's almost just the same. But back then that was a really good... And this was most of it. I got some stock as well. And I thought I was close to the top of the market in London. I knew people, and it seemed this was a really good compensation package.

Gergely Orosz (00:14:05):
And then Uber called me up saying, "Do you want to interview?" I interviewed with them, they gave me an offer, and I negotiated, and they basically doubled my compensation. I was like, wow, this is [inaudible 00:14:16] I knew about Silicon Valley compensation, but I assumed that [inaudible 00:14:20] you're not going to get this, but Uber was getting something closer to that. So I told myself, all right, so I'm getting a really good deal, and most of it is stock, which is... Uber [inaudible 00:14:32] 2016, no-one knew if Uber will go public, although I suspected, because they contacted me to build a payments team so do a SOX compliant payment system. And you need a SOX compliant payment system if you want to go IPO.

Lenny (00:14:44):
That's funny. It reminds me at Airbnb, there's all these people trying to figure out, when are we going to go public? And then there's the team working on SOX stuff and Sarbanes-Oxley, this is good.

Gergely Orosz (00:14:55):
Yeah. So anyway, I said, all right, this is a massive lottery ticket. If it goes in, every year I make two years of salary, pretty much. That's how I was thinking. But if not, again, don't forget I'm in Europe where we're used to not seeing any returns on stock. So European software engineers will not value stock as much, because they just haven't seen success stories. So I told myself, if four years later Uber exits and I make a bunch of money, I owe it to myself to take a risk, because then I'll have four years of savings in my bank, which... Back then I had maybe six months of savings or something. So this was the promise to myself.

Gergely Orosz (00:15:32):
And then I probably would've forgotten about this, but four years later, almost on the dot, COVID starts, and it really hit super hard. We're laying off people, we had to lay off 20% of the engineers. I was already managing a group of about 30 people, I had managers under me, and 20% of the people or 15% had to be let go. And I was thinking to myself, what am I doing here? I looked ahead, Uber was going to have a really bad year, I'm going to have to manage morale. Up to then, I'd helped put together this team, and we had a really good charter, and we had to throw that charter out the window, because it made no sense with the economic reality. So I thought back, and I told myself, if I'll be here, I'll take a risk, and I'll try to do something else. So I was like, all right, let me pull this trigger.

Gergely Orosz (00:16:18):
And my plan was very simple. Leave Uber and start a startup, raise venture capital, because I haven't done that before but it kind of runs in the family. My brother's on his second startup, and he sold his first one to Skyscanner, and now he's building this startup called Craft Docs. It's a really slick document editing system, they just raised their series B. So through him I know [inaudible 00:16:42] startup life is, and I felt I never did that, I always worked at big companies.

Gergely Orosz (00:16:45):
So my plan was [inaudible 00:16:47] leave Uber, raise money, and do something on platform engineering. A classic way that Uber alumni start businesses is, Uber has invested silly amounts of money to build everything custom internally. Everything that you can think of. Our [inaudible 00:17:02] system was custom, our experimentation system, our container, the way we automatically set that up, a lot of the engineering stuff. So a lot of Uber alumni just leave, and whatever they saw there, they just build it for the world to use, because no other company really does what Uber does, because it makes no sense, but a lot of them will pay for.

Gergely Orosz (00:17:20):
That was the plan. But before [inaudible 00:17:22] I wanted to finish a book. I'd been writing this book for, it was coming up to a year, called the Software Engineer's Guidebook, which is just my advice for people to grow professionally in the field. And I figured, all right, let me leave the company, in six months I'll write the book, I'll just use my savings to take a break, and then I'll raise the venture capital. And what happened was, I started to write this book, but I got sidetracked, I started to have fun online in terms of... I was writing on Twitter, on my blog. I accidentally published a book called Building Mobile Apps at Scale. I just did it for a few months.

Gergely Orosz (00:17:58):
And the weird thing was that my plan was that I'm going to just not make any money, and this book, Building Mobile Apps at Scale, and another book that I published about tech resumes, I just wrote these in a few months, they started making money. They made about $100,000 in the first year. And I was like, "That's interesting. People are buying my books." And I self-published it through Gumroad or places where I get to keep I think 90% of the revenue, but still, this was really interesting. And I got to the point where, all right, I should now start a startup. I should do fundraising and do all that. And then I asked myself, why do I really want to do that?

Gergely Orosz (00:18:34):
And the answer was two reasons. One is, I love working in small teams at Uber. I'll be honest, I didn't really enjoy being a manager of managers. It felt a bit too abstract. I didn't like being in the meetings, not doing the work. What I really liked is when we had a small team, and we had this really big vision, and it was us against the world. We were like ten of us, and we were just getting stuff done, we were putting out fires, it was so much fun. So that was one of the reasons I wanted to do startup. I was hoping to recreate this feeling.

Gergely Orosz (00:19:05):
And the other thing, honestly, was money. This was in 2021 before the market crashed. Just doing the maths, if you found a company, and I'll be a CEO and the founder, maybe I'll have a co-founder, this becomes a unicorn, by that time we will have raised five rounds of funding or six, I'll be diluted as hell, but I'll still have let's say 5%. 5% of the billion is still $50 million, after you pay taxes [inaudible 00:19:30] I can buy a bunch of stuff that I don't need. And I was asking myself, all right, and then what? And I was like, after I've bought everything that I don't need, I probably want to share what I know with people, do YouTube videos and write books.

Gergely Orosz (00:19:43):
And I was thinking to myself, so hold on. I would go off and do this for like ten years, because that's how much you need to plan to do it. I need to stop doing what I'm doing right now, because I would owe it to my investors and my team to not spend all day on the internet writing about stuff. And then I want to do it again. So it's reminding me of the story of this fisherman. There's one that goes [inaudible 00:20:08] there's the same thing of, you work really hard to do what you're doing right now. So I decided, let me just try giving this a go. [inaudible 00:20:14]

Lenny (00:20:14):
Wait, what's the story of the fisherman? I think I know what you're talking about, but... [inaudible 00:20:18]

Gergely Orosz (00:20:17):
The story of the fisherman is that, in Mexico, an American businessman sees a fisherman who's just chilling, fishing. And he asks him, "What are you doing all day?" He's like, "I fish for three hours, I hang out with my family, I [inaudible 00:20:32] chill and I sleep in every Saturday and Sunday." He says, "All right, here's what you should be doing. You should fish not three hours, but you should fish five days a week, eight hours a day, sell that fish, turn over a profit, hire more people to do it, then start to be head of all those people, then sell your fishing company." He's like, "Okay. And then what?" "And then you can actually buy an island, and you can just fish for three hours, you can sleep in on Saturdays and sleep on Sundays."

Gergely Orosz (00:21:00):
So I was thinking, look, I have savings. I don't have huge, but I have it for... I can still take a risk. So let me take a risk on writing. And I was thinking originally of just spending more time to finish my book. But what I didn't like about books, even though I was making money, is they're really... It's hard to predict if you're going to be making a living, or there's some people who actually like this excitement, but I didn't like it. I didn't know if today I'm going to be making like 50 bucks or 10 bucks or 300 bucks. So I was like, interesting. There's these paid newsletters which I've been thinking about, and you were one of the few people who shared some of your early numbers, and I figured this could be interesting, because it's recurring revenue.

Gergely Orosz (00:21:41):
And the only reason I was really hesitant to start a paid newsletter, I was thinking about doing so for at least 6 to 12 months, is I was worried about writing every single week something really, really worthwhile reading, and it's a lot of work. But then I looked back and I saw that I wrote three books. [inaudible 00:21:58] I told you I wrote two books, but there was a third one that I also published in a year, and I was like, I'm pretty sure I can write. So for two weeks I collected ideas of what I would write about, and I had this super long list. So I was like, okay, ideas also check.

Gergely Orosz (00:22:10):
And then I just said, screw it, I'm going to take a risk. It's a bit of a more professional risk, and maybe a financial one as well. I'll announce that I'm going to start a paid newsletter. Every week, I'm going to write something really in depth about software engineering. It's going to start next week. And I told myself that I'll... I told my wife as well that I'll do this for six months, and I'll see what happens. If there's traction, it's great. I might have found myself a new job, basically. If not, I'll just refund people. Everyone who bought an annual subscription... I didn't tell this to people, obviously, but for six months I'm going to give it my all. It's basically like a startup. So I told her and my family that it's going to be a lot of work and I might not be around as much, and they supported me, and I took a plunge. I took a big breath and started off. And that's how it went from leaving Uber to starting a venture funded startup to starting to write full time.

Lenny (00:23:05):
Awesome. And we're going to talk about what advice you have for folks that are thinking about starting something like this at the end. What was the period between leaving Uber and starting the newsletter?

Gergely Orosz (00:23:14):
It was pretty much a year, a little bit less than a year. Might have been like ten months or so, but it was a year from when I decided to leave Uber. So Uber did layoffs in April, and it was really stressful. It was the first time I... I didn't lay anyone off, but people on my team were laid off. I wasn't told who's going to be laid off. It was just really stressful. It's weird, in the sense that the people who were let go, obviously worse for them, but I still felt terrible, and I just didn't feel very good about it. I think this was the breaking point. This was the point where I realized that it's not a family, which is weird because it never was, but it kind of felt family-like, but it's just a corporate, and I'm just a number, and this could happen to me, I guess. So I think I lost my sense of the trust in the system, that it'll take care of me, because I saw some of my colleagues who were really good professionals, I'd argue they were better software engineers and managers than me, they got let go because they were in the wrong team.

Gergely Orosz (00:24:08):
So this was April, and in July I went to a holiday, and two weeks in, I just realized I need to leave. And I really had the urge to do somewhere where I'm in charge. And if you're a manager listening to this, you might relate to this. If you're an engineer listening to this, maybe just shut your ears or you'll figure it out eventually. But when I was promoted into management... It wasn't promoting into it, because it was a side step, I didn't get [inaudible 00:24:34] or anything, but it still feels a promotion. They only promote the people who are... Only let people transition who are considered pretty good. I felt this would be a big deal. I'm now a manager. What no one told me is, yes I was a manager, but I was a middle manager. I didn't have too much authority. I didn't even have budget for my team. Someone was underpaid and I couldn't do anything except complain for HR for six months and hope that they'd do something.

Gergely Orosz (00:24:58):
So it was pretty frustrating, because I didn't feel in charge in the sense that I didn't have decision making [inaudible 00:25:02]. And the reason I wanted to do a startup is, I decided I liked being a manager, but I did not how I was not in charge and I couldn't take corporate [inaudible 00:25:12] telling us to do stuff, and then we were telling them no [inaudible 00:25:16] I don't want to do that with my people. So I decided for next job, I could be doing this, but instead I'd like to be in charge. So I'd like to be a founder or someone who's high up, so that I can actually take full responsibility for the things that I want to do or I don't want to do. The short of it is, I decided to leave in July. We have longer notice periods in Europe, so I served a longer notice period, and then left. But it was a year after the decision.

Lenny (00:25:41):
Let's talk about what your life is like these days, writing a newsletter full time. People might be listening and be like, "Man, $300,000 for writing an email a couple times a week, that's pretty sweet." So I want to talk about the good and the bad of this life. So maybe to start, how many posts are you putting out a week?

Gergely Orosz (00:25:59):
I started the newsletter saying I'm going to post once a week. You'll have one pinned up post. And I started to do that, but interesting enough, eventually I upped it to two, so I now promise people two posts a week. There's more in depth and more timeless posts about some software engineering topic on Tuesdays, and there's something that's called the scoop, something a bit more timely, where I reflect or analyze what's going on in the market, interesting stuff I'm hearing. And every now and then there's a bonus post. So I'll say two on average, but the second one came a lot later. But initially in the first few months I was like, I have this one post per week, and it needs to be good.

Gergely Orosz (00:26:37):
And it was interesting, because you would think writing a post a week is not a big deal. It's easy. As you said, let's say you're making 300K just writing one post a week. But it actually was pretty stressful in the beginning, because it turns out to write that post, it takes at least a few days or sometimes even longer. Sometimes it takes a week or two for me to research in terms of talking with people. I chose topics that are not covered, because why would people pay for something that is out there already or well known? Then I need to write [inaudible 00:27:10] a first draft. I get some feedback from people who I trust often, not always, but I often do. And then there's an editing phase where I work with an editor who helps make sure that it's just correct. And all these things add up. Even if I only spend a day researching the stuff, it's a day researching, then I have a draft on day two. Day three I get feedback, on day four it's editing, it's almost a whole week.

Gergely Orosz (00:27:32):
So I was working on parallel things at the same time, and I was often running against the deadline, I was barely finishing it, which is not what I was expecting initially. The first few months I feel was a bit more stressed, but again, the good thing is I cleared my calendar, so I said I'm not talking with anyone, I'm just doing this. So in that sense it was good. But the one thing I realized, if you look at any journalists who's doing stuff full time, and they're writing, not these clickbait articles, but actually in depth. You look at the Washington Post or New York Times, search for their name, and look up the articles that they write, and they're going to be longer articles. They have like one a month. Seriously. You look at the investigative journalist, they might even have less. And they have a bit of a different level, they have to check with legal and all those things, but my editor is a journalist, so he was actually telling me, even back then, "You actually write a lot of original stuff," because a lot of my emails are about five, 6,000 words, which is considered very long.

Lenny (00:28:32):
Yeah. When you said that people listening might be like, one post a week is easy, I think most people are the opposite. They're just like, I can't write anything. I don't have time for any writing. How can you ever write one good thing a week? So I think there's both sides to it. And it's cool that you shared the process. Do you have a specific cadence per post? It's like Monday draft, Tuesday review, Wednesday editor. Is that how you work?

Gergely Orosz (00:28:58):
I write every post over multiple weeks, most of them. Some of them I might be able to write faster, but what I now have is, nowadays I actually write two articles. So I have the Thursday that is the scoop, which actually is a lot easier for me to write, interestingly enough. And my cadence is, on Monday I finish up the last of the post that goes out on Tuesday. It's just small edits, but it's already done pretty much, so it's just a few small tweaks, and maybe I have some feedback coming in. On Tuesday, I publish this post, and I do some free writing. I write about some other ideas that I have that's going to be future posts. On Wednesday, it's my free day in between, where I... It's interesting, because what I feel is, when I don't have pressure, I tend to not do much stuff, which might just... My mind's saying, "You just need to chill." Maybe that's it.

Gergely Orosz (00:29:49):
But one thing I miss from the corporate world... And if you're listening and you're in a job and you're thinking, "Gergely's job is so amazing," one thing that I liked and I really miss about working at Uber is, I actually had a schedule. This is weird, I hated it back then, but I needed to do these things, and whenever you have a pressure, you do it. And this works with my newsletter. I put in the second newsletter I think to have a bit more pressure. Because the second part of Wednesday, I'm already starting to write my Thursday newsletter. On Thursday, I write that Thursday newsletter, and on Friday I'm now writing the next newsletter for Tuesday. So almost every day except for Wednesday, I have a strong pressure to write. Which when people ask, "Gergely, how do you write so much?" Because I did the maths, and I wrote four or five books' worth of content just last year. It's because I have these deadlines, and as you said, I also know that thousands of people are paying me, they have expectations of me.

Gergely Orosz (00:30:46):
And so this is how it's done. If you want to write a book, the easiest way is go to a publisher and sign a contract, not because of the money. In software engineering, you're not going to get much [inaudible 00:30:57] $5,000 or something like that. That's what I was offered initially. But it's the pressure. You absolutely should go to a publisher or have some external... Someone to hold you accountable, and then you'll get it done. And I'll let you in on another secret, or not so secret.

Lenny (00:31:16):
Do tell.

Gergely Orosz (00:31:16):
In my mind, when I started newsletter a year ago in this crossroads, I want to write this book, which I think will be a great book, the Software Engineer's Guidebook, I feel it'll be my summary of my last ten years of what I have to share as advice, but I was worried that it's just a big project that's just going to take months, and I'll lose motivation midway.

Gergely Orosz (00:31:37):
And partially, I went down the newsletter route because I liked how every week I would have to write something, and I had this sneaky idea of, what if I wrote this book where I write some posts that will be part of the book, and then the book will just come together partially. And I've kind of been doing that. I haven't been telling people, but some of the posts are going to be... Not exactly, but the idea is that I have this chapter, and I have this list, have I written about this topic in the newsletter? And you know where I got this idea from? There's the book The Three Musketeers, from Alexander Dumas [inaudible 00:32:12]. And do you know how it was written?

Lenny (00:32:15):
I don't.

Gergely Orosz (00:32:16):
So he wrote the book for a magazine. He was apparently just low on money, and he started to write for this magazine who told them, "All right, we need you to write something that our readers will want, so that they will buy the magazine." I think he was getting a cut of some sales or something. So he needs to write in a way that was interesting, and then cut it off in a way that people would come back and buy the next one. And he wrote a whole book, and that book, when I read it, it's really long, and I was like, hold on, if he could do this, then this is a good strategy. He was writing it because he just needed the money. That's all. And then he wrote a really good book on the way.

Gergely Orosz (00:32:52):
So one big learning for me from newsletters then... I would argue that you can use this not just for newsletters, but any business that you do. If you're going to go out and start a new business, you'll probably have some ideas. And it's not just going to be a newsletter, it's going to be a bunch of other things. If you put in ways that you have to do certain things, put in constraints for the things that you need to do, and then you're going to do that.

Gergely Orosz (00:33:16):
Without that, when you're on your own, when you're entrepreneur, I was a great... I think I was a really diligent employee. I always tried to get my work done, show up on time, I tried to meet all expectations. But what I noticed is, when I started to work for myself, it just went out the window. Almost 15 years of being this star employee who really wants to do well, I found myself upset at myself for not... Just wasting my day. But I fixed it by telling people, "You're going to get this every week," and now I have to do it. I just have no choice.

Lenny (00:33:51):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups.

Lenny (00:35:08):
I definitely wanted to dig into that a little bit deeper, this issue that folks in our line of work run into, which is unstructured time and having to create your own structure. I had the same exact problem when I started this thing, before I even started the newsletter. How do I use my time well? How do I create some kind of deadline for myself? So I'm curious what other tricks you found to help you stay productive and focus, because there's Twitter, there's Instagram, TikTok, there's all these things that pull my attention. And I've learned a couple things I'll share that have been helpful, but I'm curious, what have you found to help you focus and get things out the door? Two posts a week, which is a lot of work.

Gergely Orosz (00:35:49):
So a problem that I have, and this might be unique to newsletters, I'm not sure. I use Twitter for a lot of research. And unfortunately what that means is when I start to write something, it can really pull my attention, because I have Twitter open and then I get a message from someone. It's a little bit like Slack, but I'd argue it can be worse, because also Twitter for me is also something that is very useful in generating people [inaudible 00:36:16] raising awareness. So whenever I tweet, it helps my business. So that's a good thing. But it also justifies for me spending more time on, for example, Twitter than I would want to. So I find that I come up with a method, and it works for a few months, and then I need to change it because my brain just learns to work around it. So I'll tell you a few things that I did, and I'll tell you where I'm at right now, but I use for example apps. I use this app Centered, but I know you're also there.

Lenny (00:36:45):
Yeah. I love that app. Also an investor [inaudible 00:36:49] disclaimer, but I love it.

Gergely Orosz (00:36:51):
Yeah. And I found that helpful, the idea of focused time and [inaudible 00:36:56] turned on, but it might just be me, but after a while I get used to these things, and I find it not as efficient. I found the Pomodoro method for a few months useful, when you have the 25 minute intervals. And the one thing that has never failed me, but I just find it hard to do, is I find it hard to start. I have this benefit that I have all this time... Sorry, there's two things that always work. One is, it's almost time for me to go home, and then I'm super focused. So when I have this external thing, and I know that there's no way [inaudible 00:37:30] I need to focus on basically the deadline. So if you have deadlines, that works.

Gergely Orosz (00:37:36):
The other thing is, if I start to spend three or four minutes doing something focused, and I get the flow of it. So a trick I sometimes do when I'm just, I just don't feel doing anything, is I set a timer of 20 minutes, and then I say, "All right, no distractions." I have a script where I just kill... I use a [inaudible 00:37:57] host file, I just kill all LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, whatever sites. So I just cannot reach it. It's just a very simple Python script that I wrote for myself. And then in the first few minutes I'm grumbling, I'm like, "I wish I could do this, I wish I could just look at Twitter to research," but about five minutes in, there's a switch, and I'm now actually heads down and doing it. And this has been the thing that has consistently worked.

Gergely Orosz (00:38:21):
The interesting thing is that I feel guilty a lot of times that I'm not working as hard as I could. And I do wonder if it's guilt, or if it's my mind or body telling me that it just wants a break or it wants to do something else. I still haven't figured it out, but I'm on the way there.

Lenny (00:38:39):
Awesome. That's a really cool trick, the host file trick. So that's [inaudible 00:38:43] something that you have to be technical to do. I imagine there's some chrome extensions that could do that to some extent for folks. But the whole idea there is, force your brain not to have any way to look at something that'll be distracting, by blocking your computer from even being able to go to the site. That's awesome.

Gergely Orosz (00:38:59):
Yeah. So there is definitely going to be extensions that you can use, and on this podcast we'll have a variety of people. If you're a software engineer, it's pretty simple, and even if you're not, you can look it up [inaudible 00:39:10] when you override your host file, you can actually block [inaudible 00:39:13] what you do. And I did this because I wrote a script where I need to run the script, and I need to run the script again to unblock it. And it's kind of cool, because I put it together for myself. So I usually find that the tools that other people use, maybe this is just me or maybe this is software engineers, I don't like them because I feel they're either too opinionated or they're not opinionated enough. So I don't know if this is just the fact that I used to like to build my own tools and my own scripts, because I can, so I found that my scripts worked the best for me.

Gergely Orosz (00:39:44):
But as you said, there's a bunch of really good tools. So my advice to people would be, look up all [inaudible 00:39:50] let's try them out. You won't know until you try them. And again, I had stuff that worked really well for a certain amount of time. I don't know why, maybe I just get bored easily or something, that I just need to rotate. But for example, when I went back to Centered... I have no affiliation by the way, so I'm just telling this. But I really liked how they keep evolving as well to do cooler things. They have a community element where you're competing with people on uninterrupted time and closing stuff. So that to me is a... I'll do one last [inaudible 00:40:23] Centered again. I have no affiliation. What I really liked about Centered is, it allows you to turn on your video camera, and I felt really forced to do work, because I knew that people on the other side of the world might be watching me, even if it was not true.

Lenny (00:40:37):
Yeah. I love that feature. It's centered.app, by the way, if folks want to check it out. So to summarize some of your tips, which I love, Centered, deadlines, totally work for me too. Blocking sites so that you can't get distracted by Twitter and LinkedIn and TikTok and all the things. And I guess that's the three that work best for you.

Gergely Orosz (00:40:55):
Yeah. And the simple thing, start a 20 minute timer, and you say, "For 20 minutes, I need to focus on this thing," on your iPhone or somewhere else. It's just 20 minutes, but during that time you cannot do anything else. And just try it. It works for me, like a charm, once I decide to actually do it.

Lenny (00:41:13):
It's cool Centered does that for you, and it has music and all the things. So I that a lot. Awesome. What do you love most about this life that you lead now, versus what you used to do? And then I'm going to ask you the opposite, but let's start there.

Gergely Orosz (00:41:27):
I really like that it forces me to have my calendar empty, because for so many years my calendar was this giant mess of meetings on top of meetings, and I would barely have any time to actually have focus time. Now I actually have the opposite. I usually have a lot of focus time, and I have very, very few meetings or things. And even now I get a little bit cagey [inaudible 00:41:51] I have this one meeting in the whole day. So I like how it's [inaudible 00:41:55] manage your time [inaudible 00:41:58] so that's the best part.

Gergely Orosz (00:41:59):
And I also like how much in charge I am. Initially it freaked me out, in the sense of how much creative freedom I have. I can write about whatever. I can change a format, I can do this, I can do that. It can be a little bit overwhelming, because I also know that people are going to be reading this, and what are they going to think about it? But I do like that it's very entrepreneurial, so I get to experiment a lot as well, which reminds me a little bit of my old job, because at Uber we also experimented a lot, and obviously more in a corporate setting. But I guess that's just gotten extended. So these are the two favorite things, is the open calendar or very few meetings, and experimenting, trying out stuff and being able to decide what I want to try out.

Lenny (00:42:46):
Plus one on both those. I have a rule of no meetings before 3:00 PM, and it generally works 99% of the time. And the reason I do that is, to your point, if there's a meeting at 11:00, I just can't do anything really deep until that point, and then afterwards I have to get back on track. And having that deep focus time is so important for this work, even though half the time I'm on Twitter and distracted, as long as I get enough time to focus, good things happen. Okay. Opposite. What are some of the most surprising downsides and sucky parts of this path that you've taken?

Gergely Orosz (00:43:24):
One is obviously it's lonely. I do miss... I had a really good team at Uber, and it wasn't just a team, it was the people. I liked... Everyone has different views on remote work. I actually didn't enjoy remote work as much, because I just liked hanging out with people. I guess I'm that more outgoing type, and I really like walking up to the coffee station and having a chat with people, or at lunch sitting next to someone and talking about it. And obviously in some sense it was annoying, because I wanted to get work done, but for the most part I miss it more than I have. And so I miss not having that. I compensate for that by working in a shared workspace, a shared office, which is a techy workspace. So everyone needs to work in tech. So I actually get to say hi to people and have a little small talk.

Gergely Orosz (00:44:08):
The structure is weird, because I felt really guilty for the first few months, because I felt that at Uber I was more productive, because I had to be. I was doing so many things. In a day, I would start my day let's say at 9:00 or at 8:30, and I'd finish it up at, I don't know, 6:00 or 5:30, it depends. I would probably have, on an average day, I would have a good eight meetings, I would finish two or three documents, I would send over this, send over that. I actually have... Looking at my output, now I write a lot, but I wrote a lot. I think I wrote almost as much in terms of emails, chat messages, et cetera. So the downside is, I felt very guilty and a little bit frustrated for myself, for feeling that I'm slacking off. That's one.

Gergely Orosz (00:44:55):
And the other thing, it is surprisingly stressful. So when you start off, it's kind of lonely. Not many people do this, what we do. That's also one of the reasons that we connected, because it's a very small community. And even within the community, I feel, in the newsletter community, it's different. You're all running your own business, and there is some level of competition. So you might not... Because it's a little bit of attention economy as well. People are not going to subscribe or pay for ten newsletters on the same topic, so that makes it a little bit more... It's not the same as when you work in tech, and you just share exactly everything that you do, because you can only win.

Gergely Orosz (00:45:35):
So there's that part, but there's a lot of external validation, so whenever looking at your subscriber numbers, which brings a bunch of stress that I didn't expect. And I'm a successful newsletter [inaudible 00:45:47] I think my success is quite rare. There will be one or two or a handful of people who have similar success, but I'm an outlier. So that's another thing that I think is just good [inaudible 00:45:58] putting out there. And the downside is, you don't really know how well you're doing. External goals are kind of meaningless. Internal goals, either you smash them or you don't reach them. So there's this constant sense of, where am I? How am I, and how do I judge myself? Did I make a mistake for leaving my job? I actually asked myself for several months actually, after I started. Or did I make a good one? And I think for a lot of these questions and doubts, having past professional experience working at a company is really useful to set yourself grounded.

Lenny (00:46:33):
I actually want to ask you about that, but I'll add a couple things that I also find are major downsides of this life, because it's not all rainbows and butterflies. One is, with a paid newsletter especially, but even with a sponsored newsletter, you basically have to get something awesome out every week, in theory for the rest of your life. People are buying an annual plan every day, so that means at least a year you have to write something awesome, if you want to stop. But it's hard to stop, because as you pointed out, the income is very meaningful, and that's a hard thing to give up. And so I'm not sure exactly the exit path that exists for us, where we might have to keep writing something awesome for the rest of our life, but I imagine something will emerge and we'll think of something else that we could do.

Gergely Orosz (00:47:19):
Yeah. And it's a really good example, because for a lot of companies, and I assume a lot of listeners are working in tech, typical thing is you work hard, you build equity at a company or you build the value of the company, and then you can sell that company, and then you can have an exit and you can do whatever. For what we're doing, it's really tied to us. So however much or little my newsletter will make, it'll have a value let's say four or five times the annual revenue as a business, but you cannot really sell it like that and you cannot really walk away.

Gergely Orosz (00:47:49):
So that makes it unique, it makes it harder to compete with, which is cool, but it does not create that much of an exit path unless you start to build a company around it, build an organization that can run without you, for example. This is what a lot of book publishing companies... So basically you build a publishing company where you start to hire people, who start to write some of the articles initially, and then later more of them, but it's not a one-person newsletter any more. Or you keep doing this, until you either stop and then the revenue stops, or you might be able to sell it, but at really under value.

Lenny (00:48:24):
Yeah. I really don't want to manage people. I don't want to have employees. And so building a media company with writers, that doesn't sound too fun, but maybe that's where this goes. That is one route, for sure. The other downside I'll just add is the fact that you have to write something awesome every week, it's hard to take meaningful time off, because if you stop producing great stuff, people leave. And I invented this PTO policy for myself where I take four weeks a year off, where I don't do a newsletter, but that means I can't take more than a week off usually [inaudible 00:48:58] weeks in a row, I don't know, people probably won't care, but it feels like things start to not go great if I just don't keep producing great stuff. So that's another downside, just [inaudible 00:49:08] topic.

Gergely Orosz (00:49:09):
Yeah. But a lot [inaudible 00:49:11] very early. So I think the whole concept of paying users is new, so I think we're going to do a lot of experimentation. And also a lot of it, I think you need to figure out what your needs are. So in the first year, I did not take a holiday in terms of... Or even when I [inaudible 00:49:25] I was writing, and it caused a bit of friction with my family. And now I'm solving it in a different way, so I am planning to take more time off now, and I'm doing it by working ahead with some of the less time sensitive things. But it is tough.

Gergely Orosz (00:49:43):
So a downside we haven't mentioned, but I'm just going to call it out, is holiday. The great thing at... I never felt... Well, I felt a little guilty sometimes taking holiday, but when I want a holiday, I took it off. When I had my son born, at Uber, they gave me a four month paid holiday. I took the whole four months, I just logged off. It was great. It wasn't my company. I was still getting stock. The stock price was independent of mostly what I was doing, just being honest. And that was really, really good. So this might be true, by the way, if you start any business, especially while it's just yourself, it's hard to turn off. And I think most people don't mind, I don't mind, but it gets to you. We should be conscious about burnout as a whole. So you need to solve for that, and I'm starting to solve for that as well.

Lenny (00:50:30):
Yeah. Okay. Enough about the downsides. Overall, it's pretty amazing making hundreds of thousands of dollars writing an email once a week/twice a week. So just to wrap up on that, I'm curious, where do you think this goes long term for you? And then I want to talk about just what it takes to be successful, but before there, do you think this goes long term?

Gergely Orosz (00:50:50):
I stopped making long term plans, because three years ago you would've asked me what I wanted to do, and I was like, "I want to be, I don't know, a manager of managers." And then I became one. And then [inaudible 00:51:01] what is my dream? I would've been like, "It's a stretch, but maybe I want to be a site lead." And I didn't become one per se, but I never thought of writing a newsletter, or now writing a successful newsletter. So I'm going with the flow. I'm seeing this less, by the way, as a newsletter or creator, or creator economy as people like to see it. I see this as a business, and I'm trying to put on that business hat. I'm building a one-person business. I want to make it sustainable, I want to make it successful, and I find that this thinking really helps me detach as well. I can actually enjoy my weekends as opposed to thinking, "I need to write this, or I need to write that." So I also want to make it work for me.

Gergely Orosz (00:51:40):
And I'm not married to the idea of, it always needs to be a newsletter, et cetera. Right now it is, but where I see us going is, I'll keep building the business, I'll keep playing to my strength, which is I love talking with people, I love writing [inaudible 00:51:56] I love software engineering. So this is a great format, but over time it might shift. So I'm keeping my options open. And what I've learned from this journey is, you need to create time for that spark to come. So one of my goals for next few years is to not spend 50 hours a week on a newsletter, which I'm doing right now, but spend 20, and then maybe take a few weeks off and have that spark come. Because the reality is, this newsletter only came because I gave myself six months of unpaid... I'm not going for work, I didn't ask for any LinkedIn emails. And the idea came and the inspiration came and the motivation came.

Lenny (00:52:36):
There's a lot of similarities with my approach. I don't think too far long term. I have no idea what's going to happen. I just take it to... I see where pull is coming from, and if it feels like an interesting opportunity and something that I'd be excited to work on, I explore it, like the podcast for example. And on that point, I will say, once you find that you can spend maybe 20 hours on a newsletter, I guarantee you'll find more work to fill that gap, because that's what I've been doing.

Gergely Orosz (00:53:00):
Yeah. And one last thing to touch on, you said something really important [inaudible 00:53:06] pull, and I want to double down on that. One of the biggest, best things about doing what we do when you're in charge of your time is, you can double down on pulls. So [inaudible 00:53:18] Uber, like I said, my plan was, I'll write this book for six months. Two months in, I just put a draft [inaudible 00:53:24] a really long blog post about mobile engineering, and I got a ton of messages, a lot. I usually used to get like three or four messages on Twitter per day. I got 20 in an hour, people saying, "Can I read the draft?" And I was like, that's interesting. I just felt this pull, of this huge interest of people caring about this. It was this really long blog post about mobile engineering at scale, and someone suggested on a private message, "You could probably turn this into a ebook." And I was like, that's a good idea, because it's a really long blog post. So I said, "It's going to be an ebook, and it'll be pay what you want." And then people started to buy it. And I was like, that's interesting.

Gergely Orosz (00:53:57):
So I didn't have much else to do, so I was able to double down. I said, for the next two months, I'm going to write this book, because it seems there's an interest in it. And [inaudible 00:54:07] I turned it into a book that was free for two months, but I got sponsorship. The point was, I was able to double down on this pull. And same thing with the newsletter. So we're going to talk about how I got the first few thousand subscribers, but the point was, I was able to double down on something that I felt like, this is super interesting, I never expected that people would care about building a large mobile app, more than a few hundred people. Turns out they do. Thousands do.

Lenny (00:54:30):
Let's actually jump to that. Let's talk about just how to get started, for folks that are like, "This is cool. I want to do a newsletter." Let's talk about just how you got started briefly, and then what you think it takes to be successful in the life of a newsletter person. So how'd you actually get your first thousand subscribers?

Gergely Orosz (00:54:51):
I'll tell the story that is kind of true, and people will think it's amazing, and also the real deal behind it.

Lenny (00:54:57):
Okay, great.

Gergely Orosz (00:54:58):
I announced my newsletter, I told people, "I'm going to go full time on this." I had maybe 10,000 Twitter followers and, I don't know, maybe 1,000 on LinkedIn or something that. And people started signing up the next day. I had 100 subscribers in the first day before I published anything. And within six weeks, when I published my [inaudible 00:55:15] I had 1,000 paid subscribers. And this sounds like a fairytale. And if you do this, I guarantee you're not going to get the same results. In fact, you'll probably see way smaller numbers.

Gergely Orosz (00:55:25):
What I didn't tell is that there was at least six years of accidental work behind this. I started a blog six years before... Actually, I've always been blogging since I graduated. I had this personal blog where I just published all sorts of random things about software engineering, but it was really... Sometimes it was about an app that I published, sometimes it was a problem that I came across. It was is all over the place. And I got fed up with this, the blog wasn't going anywhere, and I was just writing for myself, by the way, but I didn't how it was just all over the place.

Gergely Orosz (00:55:56):
And I said, "I'm going to start a blog, it'll be about software engineering and I'll call it The Pragmatic Engineer." I bought the domain, and I read this blog post from Jeff Atwood, who's the founder of Stack Overflow, and back in 2010, or I think in 2007 when I was still in college, he had the most popular blog on the internet for software engineers. It was called Coding Horror, and all the software engineers I knew read it and were drinking it. It was next level wisdom every single week, twice [inaudible 00:56:26] a week. You read it as well?

Lenny (00:56:29):
[inaudible 00:56:29] Yeah. I used to be an engineer, and I was all up in that. And I think Coding Horror came from a... I forget the book, but there's a book with that graphic.

Gergely Orosz (00:56:36):
There's a book, and there's a graphic. Yeah. And he wrote a post which really stuck with me for years. He said, how to be famous on the internet. He said, there's three simple steps. One, write a blog post. Two, do this three times a week. Three, do it for two years. And I guarantee, if you do this, you're going to be famous. And I always thought it's kind of ironic, but the more I read it, the more I thought he actually means something with it. And when I started this blog, The Pragmatic Engineer, I said, "I'm tired of my old blog being all over the place, and there's no focus, and no-one really cares about it. I'm going to do what Jeff Atwood said. I'm going to publish... Okay, it's not going to be twice a week, but every two weeks I'm going to publish an article, and I'll do it for a year." So I started to do this. I published six blog posts about software engineering, going into topics that I [inaudible 00:57:25] research and all that, and then I gave up.

Gergely Orosz (00:57:27):
And I'm saying this because I kind of gave up, and I left it for a few months, but then something interesting happened. I had a huge traffic spike, and it crashed my shared hosting at the time. And it came from a site called Hacker News that I [inaudible 00:57:41] heard about, and people were discussing my posts, and they were adding a lot of things. And I was like, that's interesting. People care about what I wrote six months ago.

Lenny (00:57:49):
What was that post, by the way?

Gergely Orosz (00:57:50):
It was called, "A comment is an invitation for refactoring." I wrote my view that if there's a comment in a code, that means that comment should be deleted and you should just refactor the whole thing. And it exploded on Hacker News. Some people called me an idiot, some people called me absolute wisdom, and it was these two crowds battling it out. And I was like, wow, I actually made software engineers in Silicon Valley argue about my stuff. I saw some of the [inaudible 00:58:17] people, some really high [inaudible 00:58:18] people were really going for [inaudible 00:58:21]. So that's when I thought [inaudible 00:58:23] my writings, some people might read it, it's not guaranteed.

Gergely Orosz (00:58:26):
And I started to write on that blog once every few months, depending on my mood, but I never stopped doing it. And I partially did it [inaudible 00:58:35] always hoped that it would get onto this site called Hacker News. But by the way, for a while, I didn't even know you could submit it, so I never submitted my own things. But the other thing was, I just kind of liked it, and I had this habit, and over years... I had this blog from 2015. For six years I was writing that blog, and in the last year... When I worked at Uber, on the side I wrote about my work, in terms of the things that I could write about, not about the details that we did, but some of the learnings [inaudible 00:59:02] for example, distributed systems. And more and more of these posts just started to just pop up on Hacker News. People would either submit it, or sometimes when I submitted it, it would just do well. And I was thinking, so people... I started to get this validation, people care about what I write.

Gergely Orosz (00:59:16):
And to question of the success of the newsletter, by the time I launched a newsletter, I had a lot of posts that a lot of software engineers read, and there was a very famous post about performance management, how to do performance reviews. I wrote one about the tri-modal nature of software engineering salaries, where I observed that there's three different tiers that are... There's big tech and there's local companies. And I think what happened is, when I announced that I'm going to write this newsletter, I also put it on the blog. A lot of people realize that they... "I've been reading this Pragmatic Engineer, I don't know who is behind it, but I like it. Let me sign up. I do want to get an email every week, instead of the things that were every now and then."

Gergely Orosz (00:59:56):
So there was years of work, and I wish I could tell you how to build a successful newsletter, but the best advice I have is still what Jeff Atwood does, except I have less conviction. But if you start writing, and you do it regularly, two things will happen. First of all, you're going to [inaudible 01:00:11] you write for yourself and you keep improving, you'll be a better writer. That's for sure. If you're lucky or if you're right about stuff, you might start to attract people who think similarly. So step one is get started. Step two is keep it up. And my suggestion is [inaudible 01:00:26] for yourself. The weird thing is, until I started my newsletter, I never thought I would turn this ever into a business, but it always felt rewarding. So I never... If you're starting out writing a newsletter to do what I'm doing one day, it might work out. But interesting enough, I never even thought that this was an opportunity.

Lenny (01:00:48):
So people listening to this that are thinking about, should I explore this life? If you think about your story, you wrote a book, you blogged for a while before this, you worked at Uber for a number of years. In a sense, it comes across a little bit like, there's no way I can be successful if that's the background I need to have. I have to have written things and worked at an awesome tech company. What advice do you give folks that are coming to you being like, "Gergely, should I start a newsletter? Does it make sense for me?" Do you need the background that you have, do you think?

Gergely Orosz (01:01:21):
Don't forget that when I started my blog, I didn't have any of this.

Lenny (01:01:24):
And this is while you were at Uber. This is before you started the newsletter.

Gergely Orosz (01:01:28):
It was before I was at Uber. So I was maybe at Skyscanner, or maybe at Skype, but I was even blogging before. I was talking to conferences before. So my advice really would be, if you're thinking of a newsletter or something similar, start teaching and sharing what you know and what you're observing. This could be a newsletter, this could be a YouTube video, this could be going to meetup. Actually, ten years ago I went to a lot of meetups where I presented all sorts [inaudible 01:01:54] I met a lot of cool people. I would say, share your knowledge one way or the other. And as you're doing it, you're going to learn a lot more.

Gergely Orosz (01:02:01):
So what I find... This is true, when I was a manager, we had to set goals, and I told people there's two types of goals you can set. One is [inaudible 01:02:12] people set this goal, I want to be promoted the next thing, or I want to lead this big project. And those are bad goals, because it's not in your control. So setting a goal that I want to have a successful newsletter with, I don't know, 20,000 subscribers, that's a goal where you're not in charge. A good goal is what you can do. So a good goal for example is, I want to learn this new language in the next year, which I'm going to spend time on, or I want to leave work at 5:00 PM on Fridays to be home with family. So set those goals that you can control.

Gergely Orosz (01:02:41):
And this is how actually my blog started initially. My goal was, I want to write once a month. And I did that for a while, and I was proud about that. Or whenever I learn something, I actually want to share it every now and then. So I would say set those goals, and the rest will come, probably. Again, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to talk people out of doing it. But for me, a lot of this was luck. And the other thing that I would suggest is be curious, and look at your professional career as well. One thing that definitely helped me is getting pedigree. I come from a small country, from a really good university which no-one knows about, but I didn't grow up in let's say Silicon Valley, so I actually made a subconscious point to try to work my way up. And after I got to let's say JPMorgan in London, I was pretty picky of where I would go next. So that's why, when Skype came along [inaudible 01:03:36] this is great. Everyone knows Skype, I love Skype. And it was same thing with Uber.

Gergely Orosz (01:03:40):
So especially these days, people would not pay nearly as much attention to me if I worked at Small Parts Limited. So there's that part as well. So you need to manage some of these things, figure out what you want to do. For a long time, I pretty much thought that I just want to climb the corporate ladder and prove that I'm good enough at all these companies. I was just doing all this stuff on the side. It's interesting how it's now flipped, and now doing these things, this is my main thing, which used to be my side project.

Gergely Orosz (01:04:07):
And I guess one last advice is, do some side projects. All of this starts as a side project. At work, no-one's really going to appreciate that you're doing a newsletter or this or that. Try stuff on the side, assuming that you have time. Or if you don't have time, try to make time. Because I feel a lot of what we're doing is pretty entrepreneurial, and the only way you're going to get these muscles, if you start some small things.

Lenny (01:04:31):
You talk about the pedigree being important. I think there's also an even deeper point, that you actually need real experience doing real things that scaled and worked and mattered and worked with amazing people, to actually build a foundation to write about, share wisdom from. And that's really important. There's a lot of people starting newsletters and tweeting who haven't done much and don't have a lot of real life experience to share. And I think that's the core of a lot of what we do, is it needs to be based on real things that worked and that you've learned, or that you have access to other people who have learned these things.

Gergely Orosz (01:05:06):
I would say that, but one thing that I'll double down [inaudible 01:05:09] that's a really good observation is, if you're serious, like one day I will want to write a book or a newsletter, it's kind of the same thing, or teach people about stuff, look at the people that you look up to that you actually trust. Maybe it's me a bit or maybe it's you, but it's more likely people like Kent Beck, for example. He's the creator of TDD, and he's written a lot of books. He's one of my favorite people, I think he's coming up 50 or 60 [inaudible 01:05:36] if he listens to this, sorry if... I don't want [inaudible 01:05:38] seem old, but what I love about Kent Beck, is he's been in the middle of it. He has always worked in the industry, and that he wrote about it. But for example, I think he invented or he was a co-inventor of... Was it TDD or extreme program... Anyway, one of these methodologies.

Gergely Orosz (01:05:58):
And then [inaudible 01:05:58] went to work at Facebook. He took a title cut to be a software engineer, and then he hosts the TDD workshop, the test driven development workshop, and no-one showed up at Facebook. And Facebook did no testing, which went against all commercial wisdom. And he took that risk joining this company where he could have been... People would've knelt down to him anywhere else, but he went to this company where he just wanted to learn. He's this lifelong learner. He's right now writing a book. But what I think [inaudible 01:06:26] if you want to be someone who people listen to, yes, do cool and interesting stuff, push yourself to get into places that do these interesting things.

Gergely Orosz (01:06:33):
That's how, when I went to Uber in 2016, it was one of the highest regarded places back in 2016, and in 2017 it was the other way around. But back in 2016, people were turning down Facebook and Google offers to go at Uber, which we all thought would change the world. So you do need to get into those teams that are doing interesting stuff, prove that you can do that, and you'll have a lot more interesting stories to share, that's for sure.

Lenny (01:06:59):
If you had to boil down advice for how to be successful in this life of a newsletter, you had to boil it down to just one or two key pieces of advice, what would you say?

Gergely Orosz (01:07:10):
One is habit of depth in the field, whatever field you do. So this might mean that I think... I don't want to say that if you don't have experience, don't start one, but it's kind of true. So become an expert somewhere, somehow, before you start, because you'll be a lot more credible. I think there's no shortage of reporters and journalists who don't know about stuff, but they can interview people, but that doesn't give anything extra, and I think people feel that.

Gergely Orosz (01:07:38):
So I would say choose a field that you're going to be good at. And you can start on the side, doing this. Assuming you have something, you're someone with experience in the industry or you have insights, wisdom, observations to share, start doing so, in whatever format. I do newsletters. There's actually YouTube, a lot of people are becoming pretty successful on YouTube sharing their thing. Three, have a cadence and stick to it, to some extent, because you do need to keep repeating it. And then four, don't be afraid to try out new things. A good example of a person who did these is Steve Yegge. Steve Yegge is... Have you heard of Steve Yegge?

Lenny (01:08:17):
Yeah. He wrote some epic long...

Gergely Orosz (01:08:19):
He used to work at Amazon, and then at Google he wrote this internal email about platforms, about how Amazon is great at platforms and Google is terrible. And he was really well known at Google, because he wrote stuff inside Google. So he's experienced, knows a lot of stuff, and then he quit Google and he started to do a podcast that's on YouTube. You could check it out, it's called Stevey's Podcast. And what he did is, every week he recorded an episode and he talked about a bunch of his learnings, a lot of stuff, and he was pretty clear up front when he started the first one, he said, "What I'm doing is, I'm going to do this for six months and I'll see if it sticks, see if people care about it or people watch it."

Gergely Orosz (01:08:55):
Now, this guy had a lot of experience, really fun [inaudible 01:08:59] I think it's really fun to listen to. And in the end, it was I think successful. It got a couple thousand or maybe even 10,000 subscribers, but it wasn't this rocket ship. And I think what he did, he just stopped after six months, and he actually started head of engineering at Sourcegraph, he actually went back [inaudible 01:09:15] industry. But what I love about this, it shows that you cannot guarantee having success, but you can do what he did, which is start something, do a cadence, see if it sticks. If not, either pivot or do something else. I feel the world is kind of about that as well.

Gergely Orosz (01:09:30):
If you think about... Take a step back of, what is a successful newsletter? What is a successful podcast? What is a successful YouTube channel? And it's stuff that's interesting. It's either entertaining or educational. But all of these things, you can't really put a finger on. If you watch YouTube, Mr. Beast is someone who you probably came across, I actually like watching his videos and [inaudible 01:09:56] how good he does it, but it's not something you can [inaudible 01:09:59] anyone would have written in a book. So there is a sense of trying to understand what people care about, and a good way to understand is either experiment or observe or just try out stuff.

Lenny (01:10:12):
This is great. I feel like I can boil this down even further from everything you just said, which is, build depth in an area, then write a blog post twice a week for two years, and good things will happen.

Gergely Orosz (01:10:25):
I'm pretty sure. And here's an interesting thought as well, just for closure. I was talking with someone on why my newsletter is so successful. It's really successful, and I honestly don't know why. And this person told me something interesting. This is a person who had a really successful YouTube channel with about 200,000 subscribers, so more than my newsletter. And he said this. He's like, "What I noticed is, you started your blog in 2015, 2016, and I started my YouTube channel in 2019 or something like that. And on YouTube, there's so much quality, there's super high great productions, everyone is doing YouTube." And he said, "You know what I don't see? I don't see many blogs that are writing in depth stuff regularly. I feel everyone went over to YouTube or TikTok. So there is the other angle of the medium." And I'm saying this, not [inaudible 01:11:16] but it might be an advantage. These days, fewer people write, because I think a lot of people find it hard and more people will do videos. And you can take advantage of some of these shifts, which might be good or bad.

Gergely Orosz (01:11:27):
So if you're going to be a really well known person on YouTube, you might get more people watching you, but you'll have a lot more competition. And the last thing is that for me, writing, especially with software engineers, it's really efficient, because I can scan through it. I don't like YouTube videos, especially for learning about stuff, because I can't even scan through the whole thing. It's just really time consuming.

Gergely Orosz (01:11:47):
So I think, decide if you want to do entertainment, which for these podcast listeners, I don't think that's in the question, you're competing with the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Education, which is a little bit more dry, but it's really useful. Or edutainment, which is entertaining education. And once you figure that out, either if it's education or edutainment, you can figure out what format might work both for the medium and for you. And at end of the day, you need to enjoy it. I personally have learned over time to love writing. I love being in the zone. So for me it's not really work, but it's fun. And once you find that thing, whatever that might be, it just makes it easier.

Lenny (01:12:27):
Gergely, it's always so fun talking about newsletter stuff. I don't have many people to talk about this life with. I hope this was useful to people who are exploring this path, thinking about it, or even the different creator path. Just two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Gergely Orosz (01:12:45):
You can find me at pragmaticengineer.com. There is a bunch of stuff listed there from the Twitter, LinkedIn, my talent collective, some of the companies that I invest in, et cetera. Everything's there. And you can also sign up to my newsletter. Listeners being useful to me... If you work in tech, consider signing up to my newsletter. I always tell people we're a complimentary newsletter. If you work in product or have an interest in product [inaudible 01:13:11] newsletter is an awesome choice. With software engineering management, it goes the other way. And it's not just... People are telling me when they're data scientists or even product folks, sometimes they get some value out of it.

Gergely Orosz (01:13:23):
I write this column called the scoop every Thursday. If you hear of any interesting scoop happening, especially relevant for techies, this might be some change in the workplace, like your company is just rolling out agile [inaudible 01:13:36] team at Twitter did, feel free to ping me, just a short search for sending scoop to the Pragmatic Engineer. I treat everything as anonymous, so you can tell me interesting stuff. I'm typically interested in the stuff that you might not read about in the traditional media, but us techies really care about.

Gergely Orosz (01:13:51):
And finally, if you work at Google and you want anonymity to talk to me, just ping me, because one of my next articles will be Google's engineering culture. I wrote one about Facebook, one about Amazon, and I tried to talk with mostly software engineers to get a sense of how these companies work from a software engineer and engineer manager perspective.

Lenny (01:14:11):
Awesome. I hope this comes out before that post comes out, but if not, then enjoy that post. Gergely, thank you so much for being here. This was awesome. And maybe we'll do a V2 as things continue to grow.

Gergely Orosz (01:14:23):
Awesome. It was great being here, Lenny.

# Customer-led growth | Georgiana Laudi (Forget The Funnel)

## Transcript

Georgiana Laudi (00:00:00):
The problem with funnels and pirate metrics and the favorites that I love to pick on are MQLs and SQLs is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. Right? It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured. Also, it just kind of feels gross for people, this idea of pushing people through a funnel. And then probably a particularly relevant for SaaS companies is that recurring revenue businesses, you cannot think about marketing and growth and the business overall as ending an acquisition, otherwise you're not in business anymore. And the vast, vast majority of these models don't take post-acquisition, retention, expansion, all of that into account. So yeah, in a nutshell, funnels are bad.

Lenny (00:01:04):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Georgiana Laudi. Georgiana, aka Gia, runs a consultancy called Forget The Funnel, where she works hands on with SaaS companies to help them unlock and accelerate growth.

Lenny (00:01:30):
As you'll hear, she often finds huge unlocks and opportunities often doubling or tripling conversion in various points in their product flows. In our conversation, she shares the exact process that she goes through to help companies figure out where their biggest growth opportunities lie, and also how to execute on them. We chat about how to identify your most important customers, how to very practically map their journey through your flows and set goals, and then execute on your ideas. There's a lot of wisdom and some fun stories packed into this episode. So with that, I bring you Gia.

Lenny (00:02:05):
I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (00:02:10):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (00:02:11):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launch a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (00:02:23):
What we've always thought of Amplitude is being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experimenting CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (00:02:44):
Supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (00:02:48):
Yeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched Starter Templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (00:02:57):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John. Head to amplitude.com to get started.

Lenny (00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman. So I finally gave it a shot earlier this year, and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1: One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently, they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself.

Lenny (00:03:58):
Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.

Lenny (00:04:33):
Gia, welcome to the podcast.

Georgiana Laudi (00:04:36):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:38):
It's my pleasure. So we actually met over a decade ago, I think, maybe just around a decade in Montreal. I was working on my startup. You were helping companies with their websites, optimize their websites. Then you went on to lead marketing at Unbounce and a bunch of other great stuff. So just to set a little bit of foundation for listeners, can you talk about what you've done in your career in 55 seconds? That's your time box.

Georgiana Laudi (00:05:03):
55 seconds. Okay. So marketing for probably about 20 or so years, which sounds completely ridiculous when I say it, but I started working for my father's retail business in the early 2000s, probably 2000 actually. Worked there for a number of years, and then eventually left and started freelancing, worked at an agency. Terrible. And then actually probably around the time I met you, I had this little catalyst moment where I joined Twitter in late 2008, and I discovered the tech scene and startups. And that was, again, probably around the time that you and I met, maybe 2010 ish. And that was-

Lenny (00:05:43):
2011.

Georgiana Laudi (00:05:43):
And then I... What's that?

Lenny (00:05:45):
2011.

Georgiana Laudi (00:05:46):
2011. See, there you go.

Lenny (00:05:47):
Mm-hmm.

Georgiana Laudi (00:05:48):
So it was right around that time, and then late 2011, I decided supporting five, six companies at a time in their marketing and stuff like that. I was starting to get burnout, I was doing a lot, and I was like, "What would it feel like to sink my teeth into one brand?" So I decided to go in-house and I moved out west, and joined the team at Unbounce. I was there for five years. And then in late 2016, early 2017, I decided it was time to move on, and so I decided to go back independent and just started working with companies and supporting them through marketing and growth and product marketing. And that's what I've been doing ever since.

Georgiana Laudi (00:06:27):
But in mid 2017, I actually paired up with Claire Suellentrop who led marketing at Calendly, and her and I have been working together since about mid 2017. That's when we launched Forget The Funnel, and we started pairing up on working with companies and sort of married her customer research background in my strategy, marketing background. And we developed this framework that we now use when we work with predominantly B2B SaaS companies, is who we work with right now.

Lenny (00:06:57):
Awesome. So we're going to spend a lot of time on what you've learned working with companies through Forget The Funnel. Why did you call it Forget The funnel?

Georgiana Laudi (00:07:04):
Because funnels are gross. I mean, it's a really antiquated idea. It's not just funnels that we sort of take issue with, it's buyers' journeys or even... I remember actually at Startup Fest 2012, I want to say, Dave McClure was talking about pirate metrics and I was like, "Huzzah, marketing has a role post acquisition. Everybody understands now." It was a real moment for me. But the problem with funnels and pirate metrics and the favorites that I love to pick on are MQLs and SQLs is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured.

Georgiana Laudi (00:08:01):
Also, it just kind of feels gross for people, this idea of pushing people through a funnel. And then probably a particularly relevant for SaaS companies is that recurring revenue businesses, you cannot think about marketing and growth and the business overall as ending at acquisition. Otherwise, you're not in business anymore. The vast, vast majority of these models don't take post-acquisition retention, expansion, all of that into account. They also leave the problem stage out. So the world that customers are living in prior to discovering you, which is a really critical, that context is unbelievably valuable, especially for marketing. So to delete that out of the equation is a big problem. So yeah, in a nutshell, funnels are bad.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Okay. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of stuff you've learned, but I have a couple other things I just wanted to talk about to set the foundation.

Georgiana Laudi (00:08:58):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:08:58):
One is, can you talk about some of the impact that you've seen working with companies through the process that you've come up with? What kind of impact have you seen? What kind of numbers have you seen?

Georgiana Laudi (00:09:07):
I would say, far in a way the biggest, most immediate impact of the type of work that we do is realigning with that ideal customer. Generally, the lowest hanging fruit outcome is realigning around better positioning and messaging. And identifying more resonant positioning and messaging that speaks to that context that I was talking about before, before people discover that you even exist, have that moment where they're like, "Oh my god, this has to change. This sucks," ties that in, ties in what they care about and what is valuable about your product and then also that desired outcome. I mean, for those in the know, jobs to be done is a big sort of influence here, but if you can identify that type of information about your customers and get to know them at that level, then you are in a way better position to be able to not only position your product but also use much more powerful messaging.

Georgiana Laudi (00:10:06):
So typically, what we do is, we'll identify those gaps of almost, I mean I shouldn't even say nine times out of 10, 99 times out of a hundred, a company's website is not doing as much as it could do. It's not being as effective from a messaging and positioning standpoint as it could. So websites tend to get update. We will do a lot of overhauls on messaging on a website and improve performance there. One of my favorite examples of that is a social media tool that we worked with where we did really very simple research for them, honestly, identified two different jobs to be done, zeroed in on one of them, and then updated the messaging on the website.

Georgiana Laudi (00:10:46):
We shortened the trial from 30 days to seven. The conversion on the website went up with this new messaging by 89%. But the thing that I love the most about that particular story is that we didn't even touch anything after the signup experience. We hadn't even gotten there and the trial-to-paid conversion rate increased 40%, and we didn't touch it. It was just because a more qualified, better fit customer was coming through the door. So there was more of them and there were better qualified. So that's a really specific example that is very typical of this type of work.

Georgiana Laudi (00:11:19):
There's other examples, though, of product adoption and using that messaging and positioning past the website, even in the product onboarding itself, email and app, whatever, and just making sure that they're getting to and have the calms to get to the parts of the product that they care about the most, which can increase trial-to-paid or product activation. With Autobooks, the product usage of the North Star product usage jumped by 300% or something within quite a short period of time after rolling out email onboarding to support that product experience. I know SparkToro as well, which I think we might end up talking about again when we talk about the process, they doubled their trial-to-paid conversion rate when we worked with them because of post acquisition optimization to their messaging.

Lenny (00:12:01):
I imagine people are listening to this and they're like, "This is what I'm waiting for, some kind of huge win, some huge conversion, a success." I'm curious, how often do you find companies have something like this, like a latent opportunity to double, triple conversion? Everyone's hoping a conversion like this.

Georgiana Laudi (00:12:18):
Oh, boy.

Lenny (00:12:19):
Yeah. What's the general hit rate?

Georgiana Laudi (00:12:22):
So many. I mean I would say, pretty well every company we've ever worked with has... Not pretty well. Every company we've ever worked with has learned something new about their customers that they can apply at some juncture of their customer's experience, whether or not it is in campaigns to reach the right people out in the world, whether or not it's doing a better job with their messaging and positioning on their website, or their go-to market or acquisition strategy on their website using a sandbox account or getting a faux freemium account to let people kick the tires of their product prior to getting on a sales call. That's something that could potentially happen.

Georgiana Laudi (00:13:06):
The post-acquisition experience I'm talking about, it is so often an afterthought somehow where that additional of layer... I think part of the reason why it's an afterthought is because product onboarding in particular, and you've probably heard this too, it tends to be kind of like no man's land. Who owns that? Is it marketing? If it's freemium, in my opinion it should be marketing because freemium is a marketing tool, but not everybody subscribes to that. Not every company would necessarily agree that that's the case. A lot of companies might say, "No, it's product." So we end up seeing a messy middle there because there's no natural handoff. So pretty well, every company that we've worked with has had an opportunity to improve, especially product onboarding and product activation.

Lenny (00:13:53):
Awesome. So basically everybody will benefit from what we're about to talk about.

Georgiana Laudi (00:13:56):
A hundred percent.

Lenny (00:13:56):
Amazing. Great.

Georgiana Laudi (00:13:56):
Yes.

Lenny (00:14:00):
All right. We've got wrap detention as a way to maybe transition into your process. So you're visiting a site once, and I invited you to the Airbnb office we were having a happy hour, and I gave you a tour. You told me later that something you saw while you're walking around the office transformed the way you think about growth and inform the way you think about approaching this problem. Can you talk about that?

Georgiana Laudi (00:14:24):
Yes. This is one of my favorite... It was 2013, so you and I might have met in 2011, and then a couple years later I was in town for a conference and we toured the office, HQ and everything. Of course, it was all stars in my eyes because what a beautiful office too. So it was quite like, I would've remembered it regardless. But we went downstairs, very different from the very polished upstairs. We went downstairs to where your working area was, where the product team was, and there were sheets of paper taped to the wall, a bunch in a row. And it would've been easy to miss because it's kind of chaotic down there, but it was the customer journey of an Airbnb customer through two posts.

Georgiana Laudi (00:15:12):
What struck me, I was like, "Oh that's interesting. I'm in the middle of building one out for us." Leading marketing at Unbounce at the time. And I was interestingly with the customer success, he was also with me. So Ryan Engley was there with me, and it was the perfect sort of that him and I saw it together. It was a customer journey that was focused on the customer. So versus that pirate metrics problem or that the typical buyer's journey problem that I was talking about earlier, it was the complete reverse of that. It was illustrated. The emotional journey was part of it. The role that Airbnb played as a direct touchpoint and also indirect, what was going on in the person's life that had nothing to do outside of Airbnb, which I thought was really interesting.

Georgiana Laudi (00:16:01):
It was like, the beautiful little milestones really encapsulated in a sort of snapshot way, such that anybody walking by it or anybody being reminded that it existed could understand in a glance what the goal was at each of those milestones. I was like, "Well, shit, this is completely through the lens of the customer versus the business and the grossness of the funnel." It's just so far removed from that experience that I was like, "Ryan, look at this. We need this." He was like, "Oh yeah, this is good." I took a picture. Can't find it for the life of me.

Georgiana Laudi (00:16:39):
But we returned back to the office the following week, and co-founder and head of product, head of CS, so Ryan, Carter Gilchrist, who's head of product and co-founder, Ryan, and I, head of marketing, the three of us locked ourselves in the room for two days and made our own. It was a circle. I mean looking back, it's hysterical, but it was sort of democratized to the rest of the team in a way because it had that buy-in. Everybody was like, "Oh yeah. Okay, this makes sense and I understand." It made everybody feel a lot better about what they were doing because it was about value, delivering value at each of the points.

Georgiana Laudi (00:17:13):
So that grossness sort of goes away and we're like, "Oh cool." I don't want to be too kumbaya about it, but it was a bit of a moment. And also, it made communicating with especially the product team and the engineering team a lot easier for me. So we were using a shared language. The rest of the company who aren't necessarily customer facing really understood, I think, at a different level what we were all doing together in KPIs, yada yada yada. So it was amazing. Honestly, I mean I can't credit only that obviously to our growth, but it was a pretty impressive couple years that followed that. I think the alignment that that brought us was huge. Yeah. Anyway, that's the story. Sorry, that wasn't super short, but it was big.

Lenny (00:18:02):
That's great.

Georgiana Laudi (00:18:03):
It was a big thing. Yeah.

Lenny (00:18:05):
We're going to link pictures of this on the show notes. Internally, it was called Project Snow White because it was inspired by-

Georgiana Laudi (00:18:13):
Oh yeah, that's right.

Lenny (00:18:13):
Yeah. It was inspired by Brian reading the biography of Walt Disney, and they needed to create the storyboard basically to create Snow White because it was so complicated to make that movie. It might have been the first animated film with storyboards.

Georgiana Laudi (00:18:24):
Okay.

Lenny (00:18:25):
So it was basically a storyboard of a trip on Airbnb of a host and a guest.

Georgiana Laudi (00:18:30):
That's right.

Lenny (00:18:30):
And in detail, I forget if I told you this, but Airbnb hired a full-time storyboard artist from Pixar to draw these key frames.

Georgiana Laudi (00:18:38):
I think I did know that. I was very grateful to have seen it. I didn't realize at the time, but it changed the way, like you said at the beginning, it changed the way that I thought about marketing because it really made it obvious to not only me, of course, and to everybody, that customer experience layer, that marketers are so good at, has such an incredibly important role in driving revenue. Not just in building awareness, but in playing a major role in helping customers get value and catching them when they fall off and all that kind of stuff. So it changed a lot for us.

Lenny (00:19:19):
And it informed the way that you approach your consultancy with Forget The funnel. So as a transition to talk about that, the way I'm thinking we approach this is, imagine a customer, what is the process you go through? What are the steps? How do you go about helping a company figure out where they should invest, what they're doing right and wrong? I should also mention you're writing a book about this that's going to explain this whole process, that's coming out later in the year.

Georgiana Laudi (00:19:40):
Right. Yeah.

Lenny (00:19:41):
So we'll talk about that at the end as well. I'll turn over to you.

Georgiana Laudi (00:19:46):
Cool. I mean if I go down a rabbit hole and you want to pull me out and have me unpack something, let me know. Well, the process is pretty straightforward. At the highest level, the idea is, understand your best customers, map their experience, like we were just talking about, map their experience through the lens of delivering value to them, make it measurable, and then evaluate what you're doing today that is out of alignment with that. Pretty straightforward. I mean that doesn't sound too hard of a job, of course. But research is an really important part of that. So the story that I was going to use to illustrate this is, there's a company that we work with from time to time. We worked with them at least twice, arguably three times.

Georgiana Laudi (00:20:34):
So Rand Fishkin who was the founder of Moz, he's got a new product. It's an audience research tool called SparkToro. And when they first launched, actually even pre-launched, Rand and Casey came to Claire and I to help with their positioning and messaging as they were going forward to launch. I mean Rand and Casey, they're both very, very thoughtful and they take their time with stuff. So they were just looking for that extra layer of like, "Is this good enough to launch kind of thing?" So we help them with their positioning and messaging. And off they went.

Georgiana Laudi (00:21:08):
About a year later, they came back because though they were doing a decent job generating traffic and interest in SparkToro, I mean Rand is no small fish so he's got a good audience built in, which is fantastic, but those that were getting to the website... Those that were signing up for the product, those weren't issues. But the people that were signing up for their free product weren't converting to paid in the way that they believed they could. So we decided to work with them and basically go to the source and find out, from SparkToro's best customers, what can we learn from them that we can then reflect back in the product experience and the customer experience for them?

Georgiana Laudi (00:21:54):
So I mentioned it before, but we are heavy believers in the jobs-to-be-done theory, which is basically this idea that people don't buy your product, they buy the better version of themselves, yada yada. I don't need to explain any of that. But we use that to guide our research. And with SparkToro, we were in a position, and the purists will hate me saying this, but we were in a position to be able to run surveys. So yes, interviews are ideal always, but we did think that we could learn a ton from surveys to then, if needed, double down with interviews. We didn't end up actually needing to run the interviews because the surface that we ran were pretty decisive and clear in terms of what we learned. So what we did was, we identified SparkToro's best customers. Now, what I mean by best customers is those that get a ton of value from your product as of exist today, pay obviously. They're happy. They're low maintenance. And very importantly, they signed up for your product recently enough that they remember what life was like before.

Georgiana Laudi (00:22:57):
So generally, we say that's in the three to six-month range. Because if you go to somebody that's been your customer for two years, they're just going to fill answers with what they think might have been going on in their life. But if you ask customers who remember what life was like before, you're going to get a lot more interesting responses, a lot more accurate depiction of what was going on. So that's the criteria we went forward. Surveyed their customers. We're trying to uncover from them what was going on in their life when they were seeking out a solution, what happened, what was that trigger moment when they did start seeking a solution, what did they go to, who did they talk with, what were their influences? Which PS, that's what SparkToro does, it helps you identify those.

Georgiana Laudi (00:23:42):
But also, what were they looking for in a solution? What were the must-haves for them versus what were some of the anxieties that they had, some deal breakers, things like that? So basically unpacking what is it that was critical for them in their solution. And then of course, what is it they're able to do now that they weren't able to do before. So that desired outcome. So out of that, we identified a couple of different options, a couple of different jobs, customer jobs, and we have to prioritize one, of course, because if you start right off the bat with like, "Okay, we're going to solve for all of these different customers jobs," then you end up not being as resonant. You can't be as effective. So we focused in on one.

Georgiana Laudi (00:24:23):
And the way that you make a decision on which one you focus on is similar to best customers. So high willingness to pay. There's no question whether or not they would pay for a product like yours. The handholding that they would need would be minor or less so. And I say that understanding full well the difference between product-led and sales-led. I'm not saying that sales-led is not good, but sometimes there's a decision to be made. If you're not set up today to support a sales-led or high touch, then you may want to opt for the more product-led approach. And the reverse is also true if you've got a robust sales team, well then, you might actually be better off leveraging sales more in that scenario and might want to attend towards that. But there's that criteria that you would think through.

Georgiana Laudi (00:25:10):
So willingness to pay, it's really obvious. Maybe the most important one is that they have an urgent problem. So the whole pain killer versus vitamin thing, you always want to be selling a pain killer. So who has an urgent problem that needs solving, not something that they might have a problem with six months down the line? Who has a high retention or even expansion potential is also really advantageous for very obvious reasons. So customers who would have a long-term need for this type of product and even potentially have that need expand or change over time and evolve in ways that you envision the product can help them.

Georgiana Laudi (00:25:47):
And then there's other criteria too. So sometimes you might want to prioritize one customer job over another, if those customers congregate in a way that make them really easy to market to. That's an advantage. Or another advantage, and this was the case for SparkToro, is you have an unfair advantage with this market in some way. So there were two different customer jobs that were coming out of SparkToro. One was more focused on service providers and marketing and the other one was more focused on data. And those data purists and those that really wanted verifiable data, well, SparkToro has an advantage on the marketer side more so than on the data analyst side. So that was another thing too. So with that, we made the call to focus on one of those customer jobs.

Lenny (00:26:35):
Can I ask a question here?

Georgiana Laudi (00:26:37):
Yeah, go.

Lenny (00:26:37):
So there's two parts of this. There's figuring out who you're going to go after and then what problem you're solving for them. Which do you think is more important at this point? Because step one in this process, just to zoom out a little bit, is figure out your customer and what their problems are so that you can actually solve them well. Do you start with here's who we're going to go after and then here's the biggest problem? How do you think about that?

Georgiana Laudi (00:27:01):
They're sort of one in the same. So because we learned from SparkToro's ideal customers, we already know that they're a fit for the product. They're happy, happily paying, prime them out of their golden hands customers. They're the customers that we want more of. So we've already validated that there's a demand from that customer base. Now, what I'm describing about choosing between two different customer jobs is really just, of those ideal customers, which customer job do you want to lean into? It's not that you wouldn't necessarily still be able to solve for that other customer job, it's just not the one that you would lead with. And I always cautious around this too because sometimes with founders, what'll happen is, there's a level set that just because we were prioritizing one customer job in the short term, doesn't mean you can't serve that other customer job down the line.

Georgiana Laudi (00:27:57):
A classic example of that is products that serve both brands and agencies for example. So the customer job for brands will be slightly different than agencies. And if you've got an advantage with one, you would just start with one and then you would go back after it. That's a bit of a level up after the fact. It's not part of the core processes, it's what you would do after. But it doesn't mean you can't solve for the other customer jobs, it just means put one foot in front of the other, do a really good job of one thing first, and then we'll add that on later. I don't know if that a hundred percent answered your question though.

Lenny (00:28:32):
Yeah. Yeah.

Georgiana Laudi (00:28:33):
Okay.

Lenny (00:28:34):
The reason that you start here is... Basically what you're trying to do is help SparkToro, in this example, grow faster.

Georgiana Laudi (00:28:40):
I mean we're trying to help them figure out why they're free-to-paid conversion rate was lower than what they wanted. Right? That was the challenge they came to us with. Our traffic numbers are good. Even our signups on our website, our positioning and messaging on our website is clearly doing a good job. But once people get into the product, there's not enough of them getting to value quickly enough. I mean they still had healthy customer base, but they knew that that number could be increased. So we knew what we were solving for.

Lenny (00:29:11):
Got it. Okay. That helps.

Georgiana Laudi (00:29:13):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:29:14):
So step one here is figure out who do you want to focus on, not just... Because a lot of people would go at this problem like, "Okay, conversion is whatever, 10%, how do we increase? Let's look at this data. Let's look at it. They're bouncing. Let's look at why people are confused." And your approach is, "No, let's focus on the people we really want to get into this product and focus on making them convert, and not focus as much on the general case of conversion."

Georgiana Laudi (00:29:39):
Right. We would get to that though. That's a really important part of the process, but it comes after figuring out who you're even solving for. But it's definitely important to look at those numbers. I mean, I'm not saying don't look at the data. Obviously you have to. They wouldn't have identified a problem had they not been looking at the data. So the challenge that happened so, so often, and I mean this happens with a lot of teams, particularly marketers fall victim to this tactical way of approaching things and piecemealing things, piecemealing campaigns or programs to prove that we're doing something and we're driving up numbers, and they don't take big enough sort of swings. So this is like, zoom out for a second, figure out who is it that you even want coming through the front door. I mean, the social media platform tool that I mentioned, the trial-to-pay conversion rate bumped up 40% because a higher qualified person comes through the front door. So it matters.

Georgiana Laudi (00:30:40):
So if you can zoom out and keep in your mind's eye that ideal customer job, that thing that you're solving for. We're not at personas. We don't care about personas at all. They're important when you start talking about advertising and targeting and that demographic data that you have to know when you're doing advertising and things like that. That is not what I'm describing here at all. I find that jobs be done too helps tie and bond marketing and product and customer success together a lot more because all three of those teams, or arguably four with sales, should all be focused on this theme customer that's not revolutionary. So this is just a sort of helpful way to do that.

Georgiana Laudi (00:31:24):
Product teams know and subscribe for the most part to the jobs-to-be-done theory. So marketers should follow suit, and there's a lot to be gained anyway on the marketing side. So anyway, the short of it basically is that because we knew we were focused on increasing that free-to-pay conversion rate, the next step after the job is the mapping. So it's identifying, okay, for this ideal customer, what are those key milestones in their relationship with our product? What are those big of leaps of faith is how I describe it. I mean I don't need to explain. The Airbnb customer journey tells that story. Where's a value moment in this relationship? Where are they reaching value?

Lenny (00:32:06):
Make some examples of that for folks that are trying to do this for themselves potentially. And then also, how many of these moments would you suggest people have?

Georgiana Laudi (00:32:13):
Yeah. So it completely depends on the product and the customer for that matter. I shouldn't leave that part over it. Obviously that's important. In general though, what we would do is, we'd break it down into a struggle phase and evaluation phase and a growth phase. Struggle phase is, they're experiencing the problem, life sucks, they're using the old way, something's got to happen, they've got to solve this thing. In general, the struggle phase would break down between out in the world experiencing the problem for the first time. So we call that a problem. And generally there would be another one called interest, where it's like, "Okay, now they're starting to shop around. They're getting into solution seeking mode." They might be on your website. They might be on your competitor's websites. They're reading product reviews, things like that. That's interest stage.

Georgiana Laudi (00:33:00):
And then there's the evaluation phase, which generally breaks down, I will say two or three milestones within the evaluation phase. I say two or three because if you have a more complex product, more complex customer is the more likely scenario. There may be more leaps of faith or more milestones, heavier lift for you to take. So we have worked with companies where the evaluation phase has been three or four milestones, I would always default to as few as possible. So if I'm cutting it down to lowest common denominator, I would say a first value would be the first milestone within evaluation. So you want to get them to that product activation really, really quickly. And then value realization is the milestone where you're solving that customer job. So they reach a point with your product where they're like, "Hell yes, this is it." And for the first time, they reach this critical threshold of product engagement. Now, what that product engagement is with your unique product for that specific customer is up for debate, but there still needs to be that moment.

Georgiana Laudi (00:34:08):
And then there's the growth phase, which is about the continued value. So getting to frequency of usage and a healthy building of that habit, getting into a cadence that makes sense. What type of feature usage and end product usage should you want to see there and then on what frequency becomes really important. And then there's another milestone generally after that where you're like, "Okay cool, they're in. They're pro. Now, what else do they need?" What else do they need from a product? And also, how else can we amplify them or work with them to either start teaching our tool to other people? I mean there's all kinds of things that can happen about growth. That's where the promise that exponential growth assess sort of comes into play.

Lenny (00:34:54):
And as people listen to this, just to maybe help if it's not super obvious, what people shouldn't imagine is like a little key frame, a storyboard frame of like, "Here's something your customer is doing." Right?

Georgiana Laudi (00:35:04):
Yeah. We often talk about it and describe it as the story of how I met and fell in love with your product. It's like this documentary of being out in the world, finding it, realizing that like, "Hell yeah, this might actually solve a problem for us. This might be it." Getting that enough value to convince them to keep going to full value realization, to continue value-to-value growth.

Lenny (00:35:28):
This episode is brought to you by Maven. I've been an investor, an advisor, and a customer of Maven from day one. I even taught my product management course through Maven. Maven is a cohort-based learning platform where you learn alongside peers with a direct connection to your instructor. Maven got a ton of courses for product managers, founders, and executives to help them level up in all kinds of ways. Over 10,000 people from Airbnb to Coinbase to Google to Tesla have taken courses from real experts and operators that have spent decades honing their craft.

Lenny (00:36:01):
As part of their fall season, which Maven just launched, there are over 100 new courses starting in the next few weeks. Many of the people I've had on this podcast are teaching courses like Jackie Bavaro on product strategy, Arielle Jackson on startup branding, Emily Kramer on B2B marketing, plus Annie Duke on decision making, Nir Eyal on behavioral design, and how to break into product management with Marily Nika. Check out all of my favorite courses and learn more at maven.com/lenny.

Georgiana Laudi (00:36:31):
Now, again, I'm saying that as if it applies to all customers and products, and that's not actually the case. Sometimes it's more complicated than that, but in general, that is what we have found. So that's what we did for SparkToro customers based on the research that we did. The research that we do, we basically take all the responses, we identify the critical patterns, and that's how we identify the customer job. From those critical patterns, if we segment down just that customer job, we can look at responses and say, "Okay, here's what they're likely doing when they're out in the world experiencing this problem. This is how they described the pain of their current solution. And then here's what they say about how their search for a solution started. Here's what they told us about how they started to do that research or find a solution."

Georgiana Laudi (00:37:17):
And then there's questions that are asked in the research like, "What was the moment that convinced you that our product was going to solve this problem for you?" And the answers to that question are going to tell you what your first value should look like, which of that first product activation experience, whatever language you like to use, what should that look like for them? What parts of the product do you need to push right up to the front of that experience so they can get to it really, really quickly after they sign up?

Georgiana Laudi (00:37:40):
And then value realization obviously would be close to, if not, the desired outcome of that customer job where you're solving that customer job. And then you've got all kinds of... Generally, what happens when I'm going through this process with teams is, all kinds of ideas start to come up about what more they could be doing, even post solving that customer job, especially the product team gets really exciting because they've got all kinds of ideas about where the product can go. So that really helps tie everybody together too.

Georgiana Laudi (00:38:10):
A critical part of that process obviously is identifying we have to measure success along the way. There should be a KPI for each of those stages in that customer journey. And for the most part, they won't be a big surprise on the struggle side of things. People out in the world experience the problem, how are we going to know we're doing a good job reaching them? We bring in new unique website visitors. In general, that would be the measure of success for the problem milestone. And then next piece of the puzzle is like, okay, once they discover that we exist, even if they are visiting, reading product reviews and visiting competitor sites or whatever, we'll know we've done a good job of convincing them that we can help solve their problem and deterring the people that we don't want.

Georgiana Laudi (00:38:53):
We know we've done a good job when the conversion rate on whatever our primary CTA is on our website, whether or not it's start a trial or request a demo, something like that. Generally, the struggle phase is very straightforward in terms of measurement. That's like marketers' bread and butter, that's where they live and breathe all day long. Where things start to change though generally when we're working with companies is helping them figure out how should they be measuring first value or product activation and how should they be measuring actual product engagement. Generally, what we do there is, we can associate basically what they told us brings them the most amount of value with the product attribute or parts of the product that deliver that value. We try to tie the KPI obviously to some sort of meaningful product usage of that key part of the product or product attribute.

Lenny (00:39:49):
Can you share some examples of that? Because that's a really important piece.

Georgiana Laudi (00:39:52):
Yeah. I'll use SparkToro as an example just because it's the one that we started with. So for SparkToro, I don't remember the exact customer job statement necessarily, but for them, what they said were, the parts of the product that gave them a ton of value was two specific features: lists. So being able to organize their findings in a way that made it not only easy for them to organize within their own files but also share because a lot of them were with clients or stakeholders that they want to be able to share with. So lists were a specific feature that honestly, it was in there, but they weren't front loading the product experience with that. I'm not going to say it was hidden, but it wasn't front and center enough. So that was one feature that we could associate with being able to organize the data, being able to continue to build on it and make it usable over time and also share.

Georgiana Laudi (00:40:55):
And then there was another feature as well, which was an exporting feature. Again, it's not that it was hidden, but it wasn't front and center enough. So we tied KPIs to them making use of those features, coupled with obviously the core feature, which is searchability. It was like pairing the search functionality with the list functionality, and then pairing the search functionality with the list functionality, with the export functionality. It's a bit abstract to me just saying the words. It's easier with a visual. But the story is basically, help them use the search functionality first. Right after that, make sure that they're using lists. And if they don't use lists, let's help them get back to using it so that they get to that important critical value moment. And then the same applies for the exporting features that we were talking about.

Lenny (00:41:43):
Got it. And to be clear, you basically said a metric for each of these moments.

Georgiana Laudi (00:41:48):
Yeah, milestones.

Lenny (00:41:50):
Milestones. Yeah.

Georgiana Laudi (00:41:50):
Or just whatever. I mean you have to. I mean it always surprises me when a team is like, "Oh yeah. Yeah, you're right, we don't do that." I'm like, "What? What do you mean?" So at a given milestone, unless they've reached that value moment, you can't keep them on the train to something else. If they haven't even discovered that really, to them, most valued part of their product, you would need to focus on getting them to that value. Otherwise, you can't just keep firing off emails and hoping they're going to jump back into the product as if they're going to care. So a lot of what we'd do is actually proactive customer experiences, whether or not in app or email or whatever tool, to help them get to that moment within the product.

Georgiana Laudi (00:42:32):
And if they don't get to that moment, which is measurable, again, that's why it's a KPI, then we can be reactive in helping them get back in. So identifying, "Okay," not that you would say this like, "it fell off the train," but just helping them nurture them back into, the product didn't really discover that feature if they missed it the first time around. So it's proactive and pushing them forward, but then also catching them if they fall. And the only way to catch them if they fall is if you're measuring something meaningful along the way.

Georgiana Laudi (00:43:02):
We have that storyboard that we were talking about. We also have a map where it's the experience to get them to a certain value moment, but then that win back experience to get them back in should they fall out for any reason. I mean, people get hungry and get distracted, and there's a ton of reasons why. I mean there's a lot of stats on the percentage. I think it's like 70% of people log into an app, log into a product once and never come back. It's wild. So the fact that so many companies don't have some sort of win back or re-engagement always blows my mind.

Lenny (00:43:41):
So just to recap and then we'll keep going with the process. Step one, understand what your customers are going through, figure out the most important customer and their biggest problem, then map out the journey that they go through, the struggle they go through before they discover your product, the steps they go through to evaluate, decide to use your product. And then once they use your product, then continuing to use your product and using it more and more. And then once you figured out these steps... And is a rough number like 10, 12 steps? What's a good number just to put-

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:13):
Oh no, I would hope it's more like six.

Lenny (00:44:16):
Six, okay.

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:17):
I'm always trying to bring it down lowest, only as long as it absolutely needs to be. I mean that goes for all pages, landing pages.

Lenny (00:44:25):
Okay, all right.

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:25):
Same thing for customer journey mask.

Lenny (00:44:27):
Okay. Airbnb had 12, I think. So you're involved in-

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:29):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:29):
I liked that. Okay. And then you've come up with a metric to tell you if that step is performing well.

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:36):
If they'd gotten there, did they get to that value?

Lenny (00:44:37):
If they've gotten there. Cool. One last question before we move on to the next step. Can you give two maybe examples of an actual movement, say in SparkToro's case, and then the metric that they use to measure, if they've gotten to that point?

Georgiana Laudi (00:44:52):
Yes. So the measure for success at that tip somebody over into evaluation is performing their first search. So when you're on their website, you perform a search, it's not signing up for a trial or signing up for free, although it does tip you into signing up for free when you perform your first search. So signing up for getting your first search and seeing your first search results is that first measure. And then following that for first value, it is using search again. I mean this is very product specific like I said, but generally, a first search is a kind of an experiment where you're sort of trying the tool on for the first time. Generally, searches start to get better when you do your second and third. So we try to encourage at least five plus.

Georgiana Laudi (00:45:38):
So that first value KPI, I think it was five plus searches, plus at least one list. So it's the combination of those two things that have to happen before somebody's going to really see what this thing does. It's not that they won't get value if they don't use lists, but because we know that SparkToro's ideal customers really get a ton of value out of lists, people can hang out in that stage all day long if they want to. We're not going to worry about them. We're going to worry about the people that really want the actual functionality of the real fully featured tool. So that was the first value, that's how we would know that they got to product activation.

Georgiana Laudi (00:46:21):
And then the next one, as I mentioned before, is a combination of actually three things. So it is conducting a minimum amount of searches within a span of time, creating at least a certain number of lists, I can't remember exactly what it is, and then discovering exporting at least once. And then that is, they've reached a meaningful enough threshold of product engagement. And then value growth was that they do all of that on a regular enough basis so that we know they're not a flight risk basically. So that we know that they're getting continued value from the product. And if they ever fall out of that ongoing engagement measured success, then we can trigger either one-on-one outreach, an email, whatever. I mean obviously it can't be an app because if they're not logging into the app, then you can't reach them. But to help them back in and to say, "Hey, what's up? Can we help? Is there anything that we can do?" And basically be proactive in getting them back in. And then value growth, I believe I think it was expansion or upgrade in their case. I can't remember exactly.

Lenny (00:47:27):
Cool. So you end up with these say, six KPIs.

Georgiana Laudi (00:47:29):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:30):
I imagine this becomes goals you track, and then you probably pick one of these to focus on say, per year, per quarter. Awesome.

Georgiana Laudi (00:47:37):
Yeah, hopefully not per year.

Lenny (00:47:38):
Okay, per week.

Georgiana Laudi (00:47:40):
Hopefully short, because I mean I will say that with some of the KPIs, it's very straightforward with new unique website visitors or the website conversion rate. I mean depending on who owns the website, that's not something that should take you a year. You should never be focused on only your website's conversion rate for a year hopefully. But these other KPIs and these other milestones, I mean I have no disillusions about if it impacts the product, obviously there's a lot of implications there. So yes, generally, once you tip over into that sort of in-app and more product experience, timelines vary widely, to say the least.

Lenny (00:48:18):
Okay, cool. Let's move on to the next step.

Georgiana Laudi (00:48:21):
Okay. So after that point, we had a rich voice of customer document that came out of that research. We had a messaging guide for them to use not only in their marketing materials but also through the entire product experience, and also identifying the parts of the product that were so meaningful. Actually, their VP of marketing, the new VP of marketing, Amanda Natividad, actually rolled out checklist. They built a checklist, a product onboarding checklist and also product onboarding emails. And their trial-to-paid doubled. We were like, "Okay, cool, let us know if you need any help or whatever." And they're like, "Oh, we're good. We got this." Checked in two months later and their trial-to-paid had doubled.

Lenny (00:49:03):
I feel like you skipped the important staff of, "Hey, we got KPIs." And then you're like, "Oh, we gave them all this information." So I'd love to spend a little more time on there. You came up with messaging for them, positioning stuff. what happens there?

Georgiana Laudi (00:49:16):
Well, this is the thing. They have a team in place. They've got very highly skilled, a huge team but highly skilled marketer there at the helm. I mean not the list of which is Rand Fishkin, their CEO. So basically, what we did was we gave them, it's like a framework. So it's like, "Here are the bones of this. So got a messaging and positioning guide for you." Generally, I mean when we do them, they're five to seven pages long. They hit on the value prop. They hit on the major competitive advantages. They hit on the major value themes that you want to focus on. Those value themes can be broken down by the emotional benefits and the functional benefits tied to the product attributes that drive that value. So that document, and there's more that goes into it, but that messaging guide basically can be used as the baseline for all kinds of marketing collateral and material, but also email onboarding.

Georgiana Laudi (00:50:16):
So when they're writing their email sequences for whatever it is they're trying to solve for, whatever milestone they're solving for, they can use that as their baseline like, "This is what we're going for. This is the goal here." And that messaging guide rules up to the job to be done. So the job to be done is sort of like the top line. And then we've got that messaging that serves that job to be done. And then we've got the sort of operationalized customer experience with those milestones and KPIs. And then you sort of zoom in on like, where is the experience most broken right now? We already knew that for SparkToro. We knew that we wanted to influence that first early product experience. So that's where we zoomed in and decided on what programs they should roll out. And email onboarding was a natural, as was the checklist.

Lenny (00:51:03):
For folks that want to work on messaging, say kind of just like, "Hey, here's a bunch of messaging advice," any tips for how to message well, how to think about messaging once you have a sense of your journey, maybe some goals, any just pro tips here you could share?

Georgiana Laudi (00:51:21):
Oh, boy. I mean that research and the voice of customer, I mean I'm always going to go back to that. You can guess and you can do use your best judgment. You can use internal stakeholders and the internal team knowledge. And I'm not saying that that is not valuable and that you shouldn't use that at all. You can, but it should never come before learning from and listening to your best ideal customers and using the language that they use. You want to reflect them back to them. That is what is going to show them that you understand the problem that they have and that your product has exactly what it is that they need.

Georgiana Laudi (00:52:06):
The hierarchy of messaging is really important as well. So I mean, there's the classic, sometimes it's hard to see the label from inside the jar, so it's really helpful to get out and be like, "Okay, how do customers see us?" Generally, you can identify the hierarchy of what is important to them, what is the thing that they say is most valuable about their product? What was that aha moment or what was that first value moment? Or what is the thing that makes you stand out over everybody else? And it can literally be a numbers game. If you take a hundred or so survey responses, you can break that down like, "Here's the thing they said they cared about most. Here's the thing they said they cared about second most and third most," not to be so paint by numbers about it, but there's art in the science. But in general, you want to reflect back what they said they care about, not what you think is the coolest thing about your product. That's obviously not the best way to go.

Georgiana Laudi (00:53:05):
That's something that we all inherently know, but it becomes really hard when there's a lot going on and things are changing and the product is evolving and there's a lot of teens and people are coming and going. It's easy to lose sight of that, especially when you're just trying to get shit out the door. So that messaging guide is mentally like, "Okay, here we are. This is my baseline, these are my guardrails for everything that we produce." It's also really handy to hand off to copywriters when you bring in... I mean not just copywriters, lots of people, but particularly when you're producing copy, providing that messaging guide is solar platter for them.

Lenny (00:53:46):
Is this available anywhere, the template that you end up sharing with a customer? Just like, here's a guide, the layout, messaging, recommendations.

Georgiana Laudi (00:53:53):
Oh, we have so many.

Lenny (00:53:55):
Maybe a little-

Georgiana Laudi (00:53:55):
We have so many templates and stuff. Yeah, I'll include a couple links.

Lenny (00:54:01):
Great. I'll put it in the show notes.

Georgiana Laudi (00:54:02):
We got lots of stuff like that. Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:04):
Okay, great. A few final questions around jobs to be done.

Georgiana Laudi (00:54:09):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:10):
So you said that they doubled their conversion from free to paid.

Georgiana Laudi (00:54:13):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:54:13):
Amazing. What was their job to be done in the end? And then I just have a few questions about the jobs to be-

Georgiana Laudi (00:54:19):
I think it was when they're struggling to identify opportunities that aren't as obvious. So generally, when you're doing marketing research, you'll end up signing the same things over and over again. And if you are a service provider or if you're in-house for that matter and you're tasked with always coming up with novel and new and more and more and more, you tap that pretty quickly. So what customers were coming to them for was like, "Give me more. I need to impress here. I need more to work with. I need to identify opportunities that I wouldn't otherwise be aware of." Actually that was exactly what it was. I helped me identify opportunities as I wouldn't otherwise be aware of. So the customer job statement is, "When I am in a certain situation, help me," which is filled in by what those things that they're looking, for those motivations, "so I can," which is the desired outcome.

Georgiana Laudi (00:55:18):
The help me was about, I believe it was in a way that is organized and that is shareable and usable over time that I can build on and really rely on over time. And the desired outcome was about, I mean this isn't going to be surprising, but it was about getting stakeholder by hand and getting people on board with, and sharing and looking good, looking like a pro, and doing their job more effectively and driving better results for either their own team or for their clients.

Lenny (00:55:48):
Awesome. We got there. We gloss a little bit over jobs to be done. I imagine many people listening have no idea what this is. So maybe as our final question, can you just explain what this framework is and how folks can learn to use it, or any resources you recommend that comes to mind?

Georgiana Laudi (00:56:07):
Yeah. I mean a heavy influence for us definitely is Bob Moesta, who's one of the original architects of jobs to be done. There are lots of materials online for jobs. I am not the foremost authority in jobs at all. I think jtbd.info is a good website. There's a bunch. Also, Bob Moesta wrote a book called Demand-Side Sales that goes into it. There's also a lot of books written about jobs to be done. When Coffee and Kale is one that a lot of people love. I digress. Point being that what matters is identifying what it is that customers are trying to accomplish. So demographic data doesn't matter. The classic example is, if you look at... Oh, King Charles, now the example has changed. If you look at Ozzy Osbourne, and it was Prince Charles the original, but now it's King Charles, if you look at those two men, they're the exact same age and live in the same area. They both have a dog. They both love cars.

Georgiana Laudi (00:57:04):
From a demographic standpoint, they are identical, but they obviously lead very different lives. What motivates them is very different. So that is where typically personas sort of fall down. So what jobs to be done, to us, is help you figure out what is that desired outcome, what does that better life that customers are seeking out. You were just the vehicle to get them there. That's all it is. I mean there's so many tired analogies so I don't even want to use them but-

Lenny (00:57:34):
Milkshakes maybe.

Georgiana Laudi (00:57:36):
What's that?

Lenny (00:57:37):
The milkshake analogy.

Georgiana Laudi (00:57:38):
The milkshake one, it's not even the analogy. I think that was one of the original job stories that is the milkshake one.

Lenny (00:57:45):
Any other things you want to share about the process that you go through with the companies, things you've learned, before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Georgiana Laudi (00:57:54):
Yeah. One of the objections that we often get to this type of work is that research takes a long time and that research can often lead to more questions and can slow everything down. You can end up in analysis paralysis, but it doesn't have to be that way. It can be very straightforward, honestly, in a survey scenario. With SparkToro, in just that scenario, I have lots of examples of companies where we ran surveys, it can be a couple of weeks. Two or three weeks, you can actually come out with something solid to move forward with, and you don't get stuck in the bickering or all those stakeholders, the too many cooks in the kitchen. You can come to something decisive. You can get value out of that.

Georgiana Laudi (00:58:47):
The other thing too, the other objection that we get a lot from founders in particular is because they build products to solve a problem that they had, which is cool and it definitely makes you one of the most knowledgeable people about your solution. But products change, markets change, customers change, teams change in a ball. Not everything can live inside of your head, and there's a ton of value in learning and getting inside the heads of your best customers that you may have been really close to the inception of the product. But if any span of time has changed, you'll always learn something new. I've never been in a scenario like this where a founder has not learned something new from their research and been able to leverage it in a way that makes their product experience better.

Lenny (00:59:35):
Awesome. We'll come back to how folks can reach out to you if they want to experience this process, could work with you, learn more. But before we get there, we've gotten into a very exciting lightning round. I've got five quick questions for you. We'll go through them quick, whatever comes to mind. That's what we're doing. Okay, sounds good?

Georgiana Laudi (00:59:50):
Okay.

Lenny (00:59:51):
Okay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to people looking to get better at marketing?

Georgiana Laudi (00:59:58):
I very, very, very rarely read marketing books, but there's two that I think are pretty foundational and recent. So Obviously Awesome by April Dunford. I'm sure you've heard that one a ton. It's kind of required reading, I would say, especially for founders. I told April when she first wrote, I'm like, "I'm going to require every single founder I work with to read your book before we work with them," because it's foundational, you have to know that.

Georgiana Laudi (01:00:23):
And then the other one that I really enjoyed flip side was Hooked by Nir Eyal. That one was great too. But like I said, I don't read many marketing books. The other one that I would be remiss not to mention is ours that we're writing about the process, which is really about the step by step how to do this thing. So as much as we love going through this process with companies, I sort of took a page from April here too, in that telling the process and having people be able to rule this out and do this internally themselves has been wildly gratifying. We do it with a training program and this is our next step in getting out into the world even more. So you absolutely can do this stuff yourself. So that process is later in that book. And then another book that I read recently, which has nothing to do with marketing at all, but was really nice was 4000 Weeks. I don't think-

Lenny (01:01:15):
I'm reading that right now.

Georgiana Laudi (01:01:15):
Oh yeah, I enjoyed it. It was a nice sort of coming back to base a bit. I don't know when I read it. I just finished it a couple of weeks ago. It was just the timing was perfect. I feel like what's going on in the world right now and how everybody's probably feeling right now, it's a good solid read for now.

Lenny (01:01:38):
I'm enjoying it. I just started. I'm glad to-

Georgiana Laudi (01:01:40):
Okay.

Lenny (01:01:41):
Well, you encouraged me to keep reading it.

Georgiana Laudi (01:01:43):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:43):
Okay. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Georgiana Laudi (01:01:46):
I have young kids. I just bought a second property. We're renovating three houses right now. I do not watch movies almost ever. The only thing that I'm currently binging is YouTubers that do DIY interior design and renos. Reason being my partner and I bought a property with four very, very old cottages lakefront, almost like tiny houses, little cottages. We are slowly renovating each of them. So my sort of fill is learning about interior design and DIY home rentals. Yeah.

Lenny (01:02:31):
Who's had the most impact on you in your career?

Georgiana Laudi (01:02:31):
This is the worst question. I hate saying this, but it's probably my dad. I have to say my dad because he's an entrepreneur through and through. And I remember very vividly, I worked for him for I think eight years early in my career. One of the things that he always said was like, "It was the joy of the business." He didn't care what, he's like, "It doesn't matter what you're selling." He could be selling anything, but it was the joy of entrepreneurship. And that really stuck with me. So even when I was in house, I always knew that I needed to do something on my own and be in charge of that journey. His joy in it has impacted me a lot. He was the reason why I knew I was always going to do this.

Georgiana Laudi (01:03:26):
Other than that, I would say I have an incredible network of women that I have been very lucky. We're part of a group that we call Shine Crew. I think I'm supposed to copyright that or something to somebody because I think the term Shine Theory is what it's based on basically. But I'm very, very lucky to be heavily influenced by April Dunford, Tara Robertson, Joanna Wiebe, Talia Wolf. And then obviously my business partner, Claire, obviously changed everything for me. Having that partnership in business, I don't think I would've lasted this long. So yeah, definitely a huge influence for sure.

Lenny (01:04:10):
What's one thing that helps you stay focused and productive during the day?

Georgiana Laudi (01:04:15):
Definitely carving up time, like time blocking. I do a lot of time blocking in advance with a little brain emoji of safeguarding my time. Because we're a small team and we use Slack obviously, something else that we do to protect each other's time is not time stamp, but we put a little code in all of our messages that's either like, "You don't have to listen to this before the end of the day," or, "It's timely," or, "It's no rush," so that we know when we need to mentally process messages in Slack, so we can drop in there just periodically. And then the only other thing that I would say that I do maybe once a month or once a quarter is, we're pretty buttoned up about our time tracking, so we go back and it sort of keeps us honest about how our time is actually spent. And then we can sort of adjust and time block accordingly to make up for the shortcomings of our previous quarter.

Lenny (01:05:10):
That was really clever. I haven't heard of that trick. What's the emoji for "You can do this later"?

Georgiana Laudi (01:05:15):
We actually just use no rush or EOD for end of day, or timely. We do have the alarm emoji, is the "Now. This is going to be dealt with ASAP."

Lenny (01:05:29):
Amazing. Gia, thank you for making time. For this final question, where can folks find you online? How do they pre-order your book? How can they learn more? And then also, just how can listeners be useful to you?

Georgiana Laudi (01:05:39):
Thank you for asking. Twitter is probably the best way. My Twitter handle is atrocious, @ggiiaa is me on Twitter. I'm on LinkedIn every once in a while obviously. My email address is gia@forgetthefunnel.com. So if anybody has any questions, whatever, feel free to email me. If you want any templates or whatever that don't get included in the show notes, just ping me. I've no problem with that. And then forgetthefunnel.com, we've got a book page where there is a wait list for the... Well, we're going to do presale, and then the published physical book will be early in 2023. But we are going to do presale because... Get it in those hands. Why not?

Lenny (01:06:18):
Love it. Gia, thank you for being here.

Georgiana Laudi (01:06:21):

# 35 years of product design wisdom from Apple, Disney, Pinterest and beyond | Bob Baxley

## Transcript

Lenny (00:04):
Gibson Biddle, whose name is really fun to say, by the way, has directly taught and worked with more PMs than only a handful of other people in the world. Before going full time on teaching, he was VP of product at Netflix and at Chegg, and has written what is almost surely the most popular Medium post on product strategy.

Lenny (00:21):
In our chat, we learned about Gibson's very popular product strategy and prioritization framework, and we go through a bunch of real life case studies from his time in Netflix to see how they apply in the real world. I love how Gibson comes up with such clear and memorable frameworks, which help demystify the vagueness that surround strategy and prioritization. We're really lucky to have Gibson share these with us, and I hope you enjoy it.

Lenny (00:45):
This episode is brought to you by Flat File. Think the last time imported a spreadsheet. Did it work the first time? Chances are it did not. You probably got some weird error, had to try a bunch of things like removing the blank title rows above your column headers, or Googling how to save with UTF-8 encoding. What even is UTF? Who cares?

Lenny (01:50):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda is an all in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers, and it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.

Lenny (02:15):
Over the years I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life, with an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda doc gallery, including resources for many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda. Some of the best teams out there, like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber, use Koda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.

Lenny (02:43):
If you're ping ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda. You can take advantage of a special limited time offer just for startups. Head over to Coda.io/Lenny to sign up and get a thousand dollar credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/Lenny to sign up and get a thousand dollars in credit on your account.

Lenny (03:14):
Gibson, I am so excited to be doing this. We've collaborated on some writing. We've done a couple of fireside chats together, but we've never really dug deep into anything, and so I'm really excited for this opportunity to chat. So, welcome.

Gibson Biddle (03:27):
Great, Lenny. Thanks for having me. It's fun to virtually be in the same place at the same time. Someday we'll do that in person.

Lenny (03:35):
Oh man, I can't wait. For folks that aren't that familiar with you, could you just share a very brief overview of your journey through product?

Gibson Biddle (03:43):
It's hard, because I'm older than dirt, to be very brief, but I'll give my best shot. The intro was, I discovered I loved teaching early. I ran a sailing school, took a year off from college. That was my first startup. And then, the three chapters of my life. The first one was in marketing, so I actually started in the mail room at an ad agency, and then went into account services and created a service that helped name new companies and products, like if you're in the Bay Area, the Versatel, or the Versateller, it's a Bank of America name.

Lenny (04:10):
I've always been so curious about that industry, but that's a discussion for another time.

Gibson Biddle (04:14):
Oh yeah, well, we can come around to that. But at the end of the day, it's all about packaging and positioning and branding. And so, I was curious about that. I got good at it. And then, I lived in Silicon Valley, and I wanted to go into tech, and so I decided to go back to business school, and I went back to Tuck, which is at Dartmouth. It's the only ski... it's the only business school that has its own ski area, which is why I went there. It's in Hanover, New Hampshire.

Lenny (04:35):
Okay, that feels like a product market fit for Gibson.

Gibson Biddle (04:37):
Exactly. And then, after the school, this is the tech journey, I joined Electronic Arts. Punk kid in the right place at the right time. I joined in marketing, and then I switched over to product. It was a great place to learn product. They called it Producer College. I learned a ton, and my first startup was actually a joint venture between Electronic Arts and Disney. We created what's called EA Kits at the beginning, and that became Creative Wonders, and we sold that company to Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank. He was the CEO of the Learning Company that made Reader Rabbit software and Oregon Trails. That dates me, because most of the listeners have probably played Oregon Trails as a kid.

Lenny (05:13):
Dying of dysentery. That's what I remember.

Gibson Biddle (05:15):
Yeah, yeah. And so, the product roles I grew up into, I call it a muckety muck, but a VP of product or a chief product officer. Joined Netflix in 2005. I left out some failed startups. That's important. It's important to let folks know I had some failed startups, but you can gloss over in the brief version. Netflix 2005, and then 2010 I went back to my heart, which is teaching. Chegg was a textbook rental and homework help company. It continues to exist. We took that public sort of 2014.

Gibson Biddle (05:44):
And then, last five years I stopped direct deposit, and I'm really back to the coda in my career. I'm back to teaching, which I really love to do. So I do talks, workshops all over the world. I do more writing, which really saves my voice, and then experiment with different ways to really try to be helpful to product leaders around the world.

Lenny (06:02):
Awesome. We're going to be spending time digging into some of that stuff. Did you describe this point in your career as stopping direct deposit?

Gibson Biddle (06:08):
I did.

Lenny (06:09):
That's amazing. Wow. I've never heard it that way.

Gibson Biddle (06:14):
At least you understood that.

Lenny (06:15):
I totally get that. Amazing. So, a question I ask folks in your line of work especially is, how many PMs would you say you've helped train, free workshops and advising and online courses, and anything else you've done?

Gibson Biddle (06:28):
I thought it was going to be a, how many PMs does it take to screw in a light bulb? I thought it was going to be a joke. Yeah, yeah. Okay, my SWAG. SWAG is a stupid wild-ass guess, important idea. So, my guess is, in real life I've worked with product leaders where I was in the building with them. It would be like 500 to 1000. When I would manage an organization, there might be 200 or 300 people in it. So, that's in real life.

Gibson Biddle (06:53):
The next one would be via talks, workshops, newsletter. That's probably, I kind of can SWAG my way into that. Probably 50 to 100,000 a year. The reason I sort of know, I'm a feedback freak, so there's a Survey Monkey at the end of everything I do. So for instance, every morning I wake up, it's always feedback for the same talk. I did a Branding for Builders talk for Product School and there'll be like 10 surveys. I've got like 6,000 surveys for that. They're all watching and recording. My guess is, that means like 60,000 people have watched that one video, for instance.

Gibson Biddle (07:26):
Anyways, and then lifetime, it's probably getting into 500,000 to a million. So, that's my SWAG. I could be 2X wrong on either side.

Lenny (07:34):
Okay, a million, potentially.

Gibson Biddle (07:36):
Well, your number's bigger. You could just go off of, what, 115,000 subscribers your newsletter?

Lenny (07:43):
Yeah.

Gibson Biddle (07:44):
You're getting to a billion, Lenny. You're going to get to the next level. 500 million to a billion.

Lenny (07:49):
I feel like the level that you've helped PMs is at a deeper level for most of the folks, especially the courses you've done and things like that. So, it's a little hard to compare. But anyway, that's really impressive, and I feel like when I ask people this question, I feel like this is going to be a high bar to meet.

Lenny (08:04):
So, I'm excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that you've learned along this journey. Maybe the area you spend most of your time on is helping PMs build their product strategy, muscle through your workshops, and you have these legendary Medium posts about product strategy. So, I'd love to spend the majority of our time talking through just helping people build this muscle. And maybe just start, you have this really simple model for describing what product strategy should be for companies: to delight customers in hard to copy margin enhancing ways. So, there's kind of these three parts, customers, hard to copy, margin enhancing. I'd love to just kind of hear your take on each of these three parts, how you came up with this, and then maybe a story or two of how you relied on this and used this at Netflix.

Gibson Biddle (08:42):
Sure. You got the model right. And I mean, the short answer is, I definitely learned it from Reed Hastings when I started at Netflix. Actually, he did a reference check to a friend of mine, checking up on me, and the only question he asked my pal, whose name is John Daz, was, "Hey, John, is Gib ready? Can Gib delight customers?" That was the only question he asked in the reference check.

Gibson Biddle (09:05):
Luckily, I built really delightful kids software. Back then, people were talking about satisfying customers, listening carefully, understanding them, et cetera. And the delight, it just said, no, no, no. The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better. Delight is trying to work in that magnitude.

Gibson Biddle (09:28):
The hard to copy part, definitely I learned that. I had a product leader who worked for me, his name was HB Mock. He was focused on the non-member page. That's where people sign up for. They put in their email, their credit card, they would get a free trial. He'd looked like crap, like everything at startups sucks at the beginning, but he put a happy family on the couch on this screen, and that's where you put in your email. And that got a lot more people engaged. And so, it delighted customers, but it was helping to build the business, because more folks were setting up for a free trial.

Gibson Biddle (09:58):
I'm like, that's great HB, but I'll bet my paycheck that within a week, Blockbuster's going to put a happy family on their couch, too. And this is the problem of doing things that are easy to copy. So in the long term, if you can delight customers and create hard to copy advantage, things are just a lot better.

Gibson Biddle (10:17):
And so the last phrase, margin enhancement, that's just a fancy phrase for making money. Margin technically would mean profit. I just gave you example with that non-member page, with the happy family on the couch. It delights folks, it helps build a better business, but in that case, Blockbuster was able to copy it.

Gibson Biddle (10:37):
So, that's the model. The hardest part in that model is, how do you balance delight versus margin? So if Netflix said, hey, everybody, you're paying $20 bucks a day, but you're going to get exactly the same service tomorrow for $5 bucks a month, you'd be just like, this is fricking awesome. You'd be really delighted. But Netflix would not, the business wouldn't work.

Gibson Biddle (10:56):
So, one of the first places we sort of experiment on how to evaluate trade offs between delight and margin, in the old days, Netflix was a DVD by mail company, and if you ask customers what they wanted, then they all said the same thing. I want my new release DVDs faster, right? Back then, most customers would have to wait a week or two or four weeks. Back then, a movie came out in the theater, two months later it came out on DVD. We just couldn't afford to buy for that initial demand. So, the way it worked was, some people got it the next day in the mail, and some people had to wait two months.

Gibson Biddle (11:31):
And so, the A/B test we set up, we said, okay, everybody says they want this, in focus groups and qualitative and surveys. Well, let's A/B test and see what we really learn. So, the AB test was called the Perfect New Release Test. Imagine we're at about a million customers circa 2005. 10,000 peeps are in a test cell. They get their new release DVD the next day in the mail. Awesome, right? And the control gets it whenever. Let's say, average maybe two weeks later.

Gibson Biddle (12:01):
And so, the way we measure delight in this A/B test is, will you improve retention for the folks that are getting their DVD the next day in the mail? That's how we measured, it was retention. When Netflix started, it was like 10% canceled every month. 2005, it was about four and a half percent canceled every month. Today it's about 2% cancel every month. So, I'll just put it back to you. Do you think, when we looked at the AB test results... By the way, you can't get this wrong, Lenny, so just relax.

Lenny (12:35):
Excellent.

Gibson Biddle (12:35):
Do you think the Perfect New Release Experience improved retention?

Lenny (12:40):
My guess is, because you're telling this story, it's going to be a surprise, and I would guess that it did not.

Gibson Biddle (12:45):
Okay, so your guess is we won't see an improvement in retention. And I'm guessing people listening to us right now, there's going to be some folks that, oh, shit, yes, that's what everybody's asking for. Of course we should deliver it to them, right? Well, in this case, both right, right? We saw a very small change in retention. That was the surprise. And so, it went from something like 4.5% canceled in the control. It was 4.45. Very small change. We can measure it.

Gibson Biddle (13:13):
And so, now you get in the math of delight versus margin. If you push this out to all million customers, you would essentially save 5,000 customers. And so, what's the value in saving 5,000 customers? The way we valued it, we said, well we've got 5,000 customers. The lifetime value of a customer then was a hundred bucks. And then we multiplied it by two, which is our word of mouth factor. So our theory was, if you loved it, Lenny, you'd tell your friends about it, you'd rave about it, and you'd bring in one other customer for free into Netflix. And so, we used this 2X word of mouth factor. And so if you do that math, it was worth about a million bucks to us as a company.

Gibson Biddle (13:52):
So now you get into, okay, what's the cost of that additional inventory? And the answer was $5 million bucks. So on one hand, you're bringing in a million bucks of value by retaining more customers, but you're spending $5 million more, so it doesn't seem to make sense.

Gibson Biddle (14:06):
Okay, so easy question. I don't overthink this one, Lenny. Would you roll this out to all customers?

Lenny (14:10):
I would not.

Gibson Biddle (14:11):
You would not. Okay. Can you help build an argument for somebody who would choose to roll it out?

Lenny (14:17):
Oh, no. Give me the hint. I'll take it.

Gibson Biddle (14:18):
The hint was, there was an assumption in my formula. I said 5,000 customers times $100 bucks lifetime value, times a 2X word of mouth. So the argument for why somebody might do it, they disagree with the 2X word of mouth, and what the algorithm is.

Lenny (14:33):
Yeah, I see where this is going. Basically, the experience is so much better that word of mouth increases. It's so delightful.

Gibson Biddle (14:38):
Yeah. Amazon would use a 10X, right? And so, sort of a wash there. You'd probably lean forward and do it. We actually worked hard to try to isolate what that word of mouth factor was. It was really frustrating. And then, the reality was, Barry McCarthy was the CFO. He was apoplectic about the idea of using a 2X, because it means you'll invest more in building a better product. If you let the product team use 10x, Barry's like, "We don't have the money. We don't have the money to spend $5 million on DVDs."

Gibson Biddle (15:03):
Anyways, this is where we sort of refined our thinking about the model of delighting customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. Pop quiz, I know the answer, Lenny, but want everybody else thinking about it. What makes Netflix hard to copy?

Lenny (15:18):
The licensing deals and content that they're creating.

Gibson Biddle (15:22):
Original content, yeah. Keep going.

Lenny (15:24):
Their brand that they've built over time.

Gibson Biddle (15:26):
You trust them with their credit card every month for $20 bucks, right?

Lenny (15:28):
Oh, absolutely. I think I've been a customer for five years.

Gibson Biddle (15:31):
Yeah, yeah. What else makes them hard to copy?

Lenny (15:34):
I imagine, their tech that used to be the ranking algorithm recommendation engine.

Gibson Biddle (15:37):
Yeah, so there's unique technology. Personalization is a great example. You just brought that up. There's only one other idea that I think is... Well, there's probably be two others for Netflix. So keep going, dig deep.

Lenny (15:48):
Maybe, I don't know if this is an answer you're thinking, but just the talent they've built up over time is probably something.

Gibson Biddle (15:53):
That's really interesting. People go to culture, and then I sort of specify, what makes the Netflix product hard to copy? So, I won't allow that one.

Lenny (16:01):
Oh, man.

Gibson Biddle (16:02):
Okay, keep going.

Lenny (16:03):
What makes Netflix hard to copy?

Gibson Biddle (16:05):
I'll give you one clue.

Lenny (16:06):
Okay.

Gibson Biddle (16:06):
What made Facebook wicked hard to copy?

Lenny (16:08):
Their network effects and growth loops.

Gibson Biddle (16:12):
Yeah, yeah. We actually tried to experiment with friends and social, getting movie ideas from your friends. The idea is, your friends were on the network, you wouldn't want to leave. And you'd also get great movie ideas. By the way, that was a failed hypothesis.

Lenny (16:25):
Right, I was just going to say, I remember that did not work out. I don't see it anywhere.

Gibson Biddle (16:28):
Yeah. It did not work out. Yeah, I guess we could make an argument today, every screen in the world is magically prewired so you can watch Netflix anytime, anywhere. There's sort of a kind of flywheel or network effect at work. But anyways, that's great. So, that's just a model. But I have found that model to be helpful in my thinking a bunch of times.

Lenny (16:44):
There's a couple things I wanted to follow up on there, because there's a lot there. One is this idea of testing the ideal almost, and kind of working backwards from that. That's something I always find found really helpful. Is that something that you espouse and find to be really powerful?

Gibson Biddle (16:58):
Honestly, I think of these product strategies as these high level theories, these hypotheses about how you will delight customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. I just gave a failed hypothesis, the social one. You actually brought up a winning hypothesis. Personalization delights customers, because it makes it easier to find movies you'll love. It's hard to copy. Netflix sort of knows the movie tastes of a billion people worldwide. That's 222 members times about five profiles per. And then the margin, this is an interesting one.

Gibson Biddle (17:27):
When Netflix is making an investment in a TV show or movie, they kind of can guess how many people will watch it. So, they guessed that 100 million people would watch Stranger Things, so they were willing to invest $500 million. They guessed that 20 million people would watch BoJack Horseman, I'm a freak, so they're willing to make $100 million. I call that right sizing the investment, but that's how personalization helps Netflix to build margin, or to build a better business.

Gibson Biddle (17:54):
Anyways, back to your original question. I mainly was just trying to find these high level theories and hypotheses that I hoped would delight in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. The reality was, we'd have 10 ideas and probably six of them would fail, but a lot of value in the three or the four that worked.

Gibson Biddle (18:10):
When we went to TV based systems, we actually couldn't A/B test at first, so we were going back to qual and they were looking over people's shoulders, and focus groups, et cetera. But eventually, Netflix could A/B test what's a good experience on a TV based system. They have server based systems now where they can create different experiences for different folks. So I guess my short answer was, so hard to find these product strategies that worked. There was no notion of building a perfect experience of all these things together, so we just took it one theory at a time.

Lenny (18:40):
Got it. And then, on that concept of delight, I always wanted to ask you this question. I've never had a chance. For B2B, do you find this is also something companies should really prioritize and do? Because not a lot of B2B products are delightful, and a lot of them are still really successful. How do you think about that kind of framework in B2B?

Gibson Biddle (18:55):
Okay, first, I think that most all of the frameworks I use work for both consumer and B2B. Personally, I've spent my whole career on consumer. The thing about consumer is, you're sort of trying to catch lightning in a bottle, right? Where enterprise, you can actually walk into it a little bit more thoughtfully. You can always find your first customers, et cetera.

Gibson Biddle (19:15):
Anyways, I was thinking about what's different. For instance, one of the hard to copy advantages of B2B is switching costs, right? I didn't bring that up in the context of Netflix. It's wicked hard to cancel. It's wicked easy to cancel Netflix and restart Disney+, whatever you want to do.

Gibson Biddle (19:29):
I was thinking about, I used to complain that the user interface for B2B software was horrible, and it's like, you've got to do better than this. And of course, at Netflix we proved that a simple, easy experience actually improves retention. So I would advocate, this is important, and they would explain to me all the basics. Hey, Gib. Actually, one of the basics surprised me. The people that are using our software are using it 10, 12, 14 hours a day. That's very different from a Netflix experience. And in fact, they want and need to engage in the complexity. There's stuff that they're trying to do that is really complex.

Gibson Biddle (20:07):
You can just think about our use of spreadsheets to build a cash flow statement. I'm highlighting some differences, but the model I think is still there. If you're starting a punk B2B SaaS company, I think at the end of the day, you're trying to find something that's 10X better than what's currently out there today, and then over time, your hard to copy advantage. It will be different from Netflix. It'll be different for every startup. But if you can delight your customers in these hard to copy ways, that also builds a business.

Gibson Biddle (20:36):
I mean, the reason you do that, you want to feel like you don't have to compete with peeps, really. You don't like it when you're always on guard about what your competitors should do. You sort of want to get to this place where you don't really care, and your sort of true North is okay, how can we best serve our customer? And that's what I really love about that particular model.

Gibson Biddle (20:53):
Lenny, I would be very careful about anything I say about enterprise and B2B, because I've spent zero hours in this, okay? Now, you said half of my audience is in B2B and enterprise, and you hear a lot about the consumerization of enterprise software, and I think that's good. I think that's helpful and important.

Lenny (21:13):
Awesome. That's a really helpful caveat for folks listening, that if you're building a B2B business, maybe don't follow all this advice to the letter. But I imagine there's still a lot you can pull out.

Gibson Biddle (21:21):
Well, honestly, it's so idiosyncratic. It's going to be different for each company, or each startup, or different stage. And that's why the tools, the models, the frameworks I use, they have to work generally, but then people have to apply their own good judgment.

Lenny (21:33):
Sweet. Okay. What I'd love to do is get a little more concrete using this model, and go through a few examples of how you may have thought through problems you were tackling at Netflix through this lens, to kind of see how it actually works in practice. Does that sound good?

Gibson Biddle (21:48):
That sounds like we're going to do some rapid fire mini cases.

Lenny (21:50):
That's exactly right.

Gibson Biddle (21:51):
And I'm going to put you in the hot seat, Lenny. You're the proxy for the listeners today.

Lenny (21:55):
All right. Just make sure they're easy questions.

Gibson Biddle (21:58):
No matter what you say, I'll make you look smart.

Lenny (22:01):
I like this. I just want that applied to all of life. Okay, so the first mini case study is something that I've seen a lot of people build, kind of hack together, is this idea of watching Netflix together with friends. I think one app is called Netflix Party. So the question there is, should Netflix launch a Netflix Party feature? Basically letting people watch Netflix together but in different places?

Gibson Biddle (22:22):
Yeah, yeah. It's kind of a real case. A bunch of engineers at Patreon, six or seven of them, they actually enabled, if you're using Netflix, they let you connect with your friends on Netflix, watch the same TV show or movie at the same time, and chat with each other while you're watching it, trash talk each other or use emojis, what have you. They called it Netflix party. The Netflix lawyers noticed it, and so they renamed it Teleparty. It exists. You can use it across multiple games, across Disney and Netflix, whatever you want.

Gibson Biddle (22:52):
Okay, so the hypothesis is, Netflix should launch this idea for real, not just download the silver light, download the...

Lenny (23:01):
Chrome extension?

Gibson Biddle (23:02):
Chrome extension. There you go.

Lenny (23:03):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I've tried it, actually. It's pretty cool.

Gibson Biddle (23:06):
Yeah. It's complicated, right? I mean, you and I are both freaks, so we can figure it out. So the idea is that we'll delight customers, because this sounds like fun, especially during COVID. We can have this connected experience when we're also disconnected. Hard to copy advantage. We're kind of building a network effect. You and I will be connected and watching on Netflix. We don't want to quit because we don't want to leave each other behind. And then, the margin. For Netflix, it's largely about will it improve retention? Netflix today, 2% are canceling. Netflix has just ticked away at it point by point. It's just, it's these kinds of things that create a little bit more value, that improve retention.

Gibson Biddle (23:45):
The way I think about this is, the way that addition of this feature would actually improve retention is if some reasonable number of customers actually used it. And so, what I look out for is, I don't like two percenters. So if you find an idea that only works for 2% of your customers, now you're creating complexity, one more thing to choose. What happens when I hit this button?

Gibson Biddle (24:10):
And frankly, some complexity that everybody else building the product forgets, right? This happened to me a lot. We'd have, in the old days, there was a profiles feature. When we launched streaming, we forgot about the profiles feature for DVD. Like, oh, crap. So, as a rule, I never used rules as thumbs, but these two percenters, I would kill them. If I launched something and it was only 2% we'd, we called it scraping the barnacles, just get rid of it.

Gibson Biddle (24:34):
So, I think the key question here is, what percent of Netflix members would use Netflix Party if you launched to all? You want to guess at that, Lenny?

Lenny (24:44):
Let's say 5%.

Gibson Biddle (24:46):
5%. Okay. I think that's good guess. I'm going to give you some historical context. We actually did Xbox Party back in 2008, 2009. My guess with the Xbox team was it would be a two percenter. I think it barely squeaked to 5%. And then, because it was only at 5%, we killed it. So I think that's a great guess. If you had said 10 or 15%, then I would've been scratching my head. Could that actually have a shot at improving retention?

Gibson Biddle (25:14):
Anyways, Netflix hasn't launched this. They could, of course, test it, but I think the history, the failed hypothesis of social, kind of leans against it, and I just gave you two examples. The friends network getting, giving ideas of friends and Netflix, and the second, the Xbox Party. Those are two failed instances of social. Netflix will keep experimenting with this, but in this case they chose not to. So, not enough delight despite the fact that it could build hard to copy advantage. And if you don't have enough delight, enough usage, there's no shot at improving margin.

Gibson Biddle (25:45):
Okay. You were awesome, Lenny. I told you, you sounded exceedingly smart. Okay, what do you got? What's the next one?

Lenny (25:51):
Nailed it. Just real quick, I really like the reminder of just focusing on reach and making... As good as the idea might be, just always coming back to what is the reach of this thing? Even if conversion increases like 50%, if like 10 people see it, it doesn't really matter.

Gibson Biddle (26:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (26:05):
That's such a good reminder.

Gibson Biddle (26:06):
Cool.

Lenny (26:06):
Okay, next one is, something that you've shared is that during COVID, Netflix auto-canceled, apparently, something like half a percent of its members because they were inactive. And so, the question there would be, why do they do that, and how would Netflix have thought about that?

Gibson Biddle (26:20):
Yeah. Probably seen Netflix's stock history. But the beginning of COVID, they thought they were going to have 8 million new members, Q1 2020. They picked up 16 million. So, that was awesome. It was about that time that my perception as the product manager at Netflix was looking at the data focused on non-member experience, I think his name is Eddie Woo. And he was looking at the data, and he noticed half percent of the members weren't actually enjoying the service, like for a year. They clearly had entered their credit card, their email a year ago, and then just forgot that they had the service.

Gibson Biddle (26:51):
And so, when he thought about it, he said, you know, I feel like it's the right thing to actually auto cancel people who aren't using the service they're paying. Of course, he was doing it a time where there was great growth, okay? So, let's use the delight and hard to copy margin enhancing model. Is this a delightful thing to do?

Lenny (27:10):
Absolutely. I feel really good.

Gibson Biddle (27:11):
That's my question. Okay.

Lenny (27:11):
Yeah, if a company's like, hey, okay, here, take your money back. You're not using this thing.

Gibson Biddle (27:15):
Exactly. And what's the hard to copy advantage that you'd be building by engaging in this best practice?

Lenny (27:22):
I imagine there's kind of a brand halo, just you feel good about Netflix being really good to you.

Gibson Biddle (27:27):
Totally. So if I told you, and this is the case, Netflix chose to auto cancel these folks like, huh, that's a really cool thing to do. And then the margin, the bad news, you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. So, there is delight, there is hard to copy advantage, and you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. Does that delight and hard to copy advantage outweigh the negative of losing a hundred million?

Gibson Biddle (27:50):
I'm just going to ask you two more questions. Is this a high stakes decision or a low stakes decision? Eddie's decision to auto cancel these folks and lose a hundred million bucks. High stakes or low stakes? You're the product manager, Lenny.

Lenny (28:04):
It all depends on how much a hundred million is worth to the business. I imagine Netflix is such a large scale where it's not a huge deal, and it's a one off that's not recurring, and so you could give it a shot.

Gibson Biddle (28:13):
Okay, so you've skipped ahead. You're looking too smart. On magnitude, it's a hundred million against a company that's doing 30 billion in revenue. And then, the second thing you brought up is, it's reversible, which is, he could do it now, but he doesn't have to continue this practice forever. And so, my joke there, I got married 30 years ago. I was anxious about getting married. My friend said, "Gib, if it doesn't work out you can always get divorced." So they're saying it's reversible. Now I've been married 30 years, so it's worked out.

Gibson Biddle (28:39):
But my point here is, as product managers, we feel like every decision we make is high stakes. It's good occasionally to think about, hey, what's the magnitude? And then, is it reversible? Amazon calls those, this was a two-way door decision. It's reversible. The one way door, those are the bigger deal. And I think frankly, most people would argue that getting married is a one way door, but hey, half of folks don't.

Lenny (29:01):
Yeah, very hard to reverse. Reversible but expensive.

Gibson Biddle (29:04):
Okay, what else you got?

Lenny (29:05):
Okay, so you touched on Netflix's recent troubles with growth. And so, something that's always come up is this idea of why don't they offer a really cheap plan, or a free plan that's advertise supported. And so, I imagine you've thought about that a lot, and Netflix has thought about that a lot. How does that work with your framework?

Gibson Biddle (29:21):
Well, let's fast forward two years. Netflix earnings Q1 2022 were bad. For the first time in 10 years, they actually lost customers, and they'd like to get the growth going again. Okay, that's a different context, right? Today.

Gibson Biddle (30:18):
So your question is, should Netflix have a lower-priced, advertising-supported plan?

Lenny (30:25):
Okay, great.

Gibson Biddle (30:25):
Okay, let's do it. We'll DHM it. Would an ad-supported plan that's lower price be delightful for customers, Lenny?

Lenny (30:33):
I don't know if delightful is the right word, but if I didn't have a lot of cash, it would feel really nice to be able to use Netflix.

Gibson Biddle (30:39):
Okay, so the possible delight is, it might only cost you five bucks, or who knows, it might be free, I don't know. But for a set of customers who are ad tolerant, that might be a reasonable trade off, right? You don't have to pay $10 or $15 or $20 bucks. You could pay maybe five, or two? I don't really know what the right price is.

Gibson Biddle (30:56):
Okay, so the next one is, would Netflix be building hard to copy advantage if they did this?

Lenny (31:00):
I guess the hards of copy pieces, if there's a network effect, they just accelerate that further, and that gives them some advantage. I don't know.

Gibson Biddle (31:06):
Maybe. So if they pick up a new set of people, a new set of profiles, it's a technical term, as you get big, is you build economies of scale. So if they are able to grow, Netflix, they'll spend about $18 billion on content this year, whereas poor Amazon will only spend $8 billion. I just love saying poor Amazon. Because Netflix can amortize it across 220 million members. So, more growth, more customers, and hopefully a different segment of customers that they haven't gotten yet, so it's not just cannibalistic, could build more hard copy advantage.

Gibson Biddle (31:39):
My argument, I'm just going to skip ahead, if you cross fingers, I mean, you are picking up a new customer profile, new customer type, so you're going to have incremental revenues, which is really what Netflix is looking for. For me, I just want to tell you why Netflix hasn't done advertising yet. We actually did do it, 5, 6, 7, 8... 2005 through 2008. We put big-ass ad banners on every page on the site, even for the members. We did a retention test, and it actually did not hurt retention. A big surprise. And that was the first year that we generated an operating income of $20 million bucks. It was like the first profitable year.

Gibson Biddle (32:14):
We also did this at our business. We were selling used discs, previously viewed discs. That's how we first made money, and Reed Hastings, the CEO, came to me in 2008 and said, "Gib, I need you to kill advertising and previously viewed, because I think we can deliver a profit in our core business." And he wanted to keep things simple, create this simple experience that's part of a subscription.

Gibson Biddle (32:34):
You have had this. We had a lot of pride and ownership. He didn't involve me in the decision, all of these things, right? He's just sort of sticking a gun to my head. He only asked me two questions. He said, "Gib, who's going to be the best in the world at advertising?" And I said, "Google." And then his second question is, "Who needs to be the best in the world of personalization?" I said, "We do." And his argument was to kill previously viewed and advertising to create a simple experience for the customers, and so that we could stay manically focused on personalization.

Gibson Biddle (33:02):
Now fast forward, so on the earnings call, for him, the debate is really between simplicity, which he's a huge fan of. But during the earnings call he said, "Actually, there's something I believe in even more, and that's customer choice." And he was saying, you know what? I think for this new set of customers, giving them the choice to have a $5 a month plan with advertising... He did not say the $5 bucks. I'm just plugging that in. In this case, customer choice may be more important than delight. And in this case, rather, customer choice may be more important than the complexity of advertising, or maybe the stinky experience.

Gibson Biddle (33:39):
Whew. There's something important. What he said is, today it's relatively straightforward to execute an advertising-based business doing this. There's a zillion partners who could do it, so we could continue to focus on the core of what we do, which is personalization. Which I thought was a really thoughtful response. So my guess is, they will do advertising, but he was very contrite. Stock had half of its value. He felt he had disappointed shareholders. So I think he was looking for ways to earn back that trust.

Lenny (34:05):
Yeah. The market sometimes forces you to do something you didn't expect. I really like the Socratic Method that Reed uses in the story you shared, where he kind of asks you these questions that help you get to the same conclusion he got to.

Gibson Biddle (34:16):
Honestly, I reflected on that for five years. Why didn't he engage me in the decision? And then I just realized... I mean, by the way, this being a CEO is a really hard job. But I realized I had so much pride and ownership, he just knew that I wouldn't want to kill it, that it would be hard for me to be objective. And he felt strongly that he believed he knew the right answer and said, hey, I just need you to do this. And he was right. So, it took me five years to process that, but there's a lot of things you do to support the CEO, because that job is really hard.

Lenny (34:47):
We're going to talk a bit about the role of a CPO and what you learned on that journey, but one final mini case study. Should Netflix charge for customers to share their accounts with other people, outside of their home, especially?

Gibson Biddle (34:59):
Yeah, this one's got a lot of history. Okay, so I sort of told you a bit of the story, which is Netflix's growth has been excellent until now, and the reason they had that challenging earnings call is, it was just really hard to forecast. They had the influx of customers at the beginning of COVID, I call them fence sitters, that just happened to join en masse. And then, are they going to leave when COVID lifts? Are they going to leave when the theaters open up again? They shut down, for 700,000 Russian members, they shut off the service. You can imagine that in Eastern and central Europe, churn was a little higher than expected. Just nasty.

Gibson Biddle (35:38):
One of the things that this cloud of COVID forecasting did, obscured how the large extent to which sharing happens. And so, what they said was, in the US and Canada, there's a hundred million customers total. They think there's about 30 million folks that are sharing their email password outside the home.

Gibson Biddle (35:57):
So, how did Netflix get here? Netflix generally, they've got three prices, $10, $15 and $20 bucks, and they're always trying to give people reason for choosing the $20 one. And so, if you looked at their, I call it the price and plan page, it looks like a gas pump. Do you want to the left one, the middle one, or the right hand one? One of the incentives that they provided for folks to choose the $20 a month was the number of multiple streams. They had gone all the way to four streams at the same time. So in my household, four people could be watching the same time.

Gibson Biddle (36:27):
And of course people shared outside the house, right? And by the way, I don't think Netflix was clear that you couldn't. So now, if you look at the price and plan page today, they're not sort of pitching for multiple streams as the reason you should go to $20 bucks. They're pitching other things. There's better resolution. That's the key one. Better sound quality. You're going to have HDR sound and video. And then, they did clarify in the fine print that you can use one, two, or four streams for members in your household.

Gibson Biddle (37:00):
And that was a new clarification, because it used to be kind of with a family. Kelsey and Brit are my daughters. They're in the house, of course they can use it. They go off to college, they're still my daughters, they're part of the family. Of course they can use it. Kelsey gets married. Okay, so this is the first time they clarified it.

Gibson Biddle (37:14):
So now, I come all the way back to your question. As a potential growth opportunity, they'd obviously like to clarify how this should work, and they started testing in three different countries. Peru is one, and I think in the Caribbean. These smaller countries, I'm sure they're focused with new members to figure this out first. And so, they have two different things. You could let a person outside your household, you could actually pay a little extra for them as the primary, as the sponsor, if you will. And the other is a function where a person who's sharing your account in a different household can bump up to their own membership.

Gibson Biddle (37:48):
So, this is just complicated. Can I make the DHM model work with this? Well it explains why they did it. They were giving multiple streams because it was a really delightful experience. And Netflix says it in the rules. They were very permissive. I don't really think they worried about this. Was it building hard to copy advantage? Absolutely. More taste profiles, right? And you wouldn't leave because you didn't want to cancel the service to your daughter's and using out on the east coast. And was it building margin? Actually, it was driving people up to the $20 price point, and it was improving churn. You're getting more value out of service, okay?

Gibson Biddle (38:21):
So now, what do they do? For me, this is just testing and math. Like, honestly, let's try it, Lenny. Well, think about those 30 million folks. If you get an email saying, hey, we've noticed you're enjoying the service on somebody else's nickel, would you like to upgrade to your own plan? What percent of those folks are going to say yes, right? I mean, do you have a guess on that? I don't have a guess and I don't have an answer. But this is the game, right?

Lenny (38:47):
I find with emails, open rates and all these things, it ends up always being really tiny. So I guess, again, probably 5%, maybe 3%.

Gibson Biddle (38:54):
Okay. I think that's a fine guess. I'll just give you a different perspective. This is kind of like a free trial, right? they've been using a free trial. And the free trial conversion at the end of a month was 90% at Netflix, right? 90% enjoyed their first month so much that they continued with the service.

Gibson Biddle (39:13):
So, I mean, I agree with you, it might be five or 10%. I was just giving you that 90% to get you to imagine, huh, maybe it could be 10%, right? Maybe it could be 20%. This is just speculation. I think they're experimenting in these smaller countries. As we do this, if it were 10%, they'd pick up an additional 3 million in a quarter. I think that's going to help them when their growth is at a standstill.

Gibson Biddle (39:36):
The other question would be, would the primary account quit when you tell them their daughters on the east coast can no longer use the service, right?

Lenny (39:45):
Right.

Gibson Biddle (39:46):
I think where I'm going on this is, I don't know if we can give any real insight. The team at Netflix, this is what they live for, and the team at Netflix is testing and experimenting. They've probably put in an assumption like yours, 5% will convert, and now they're seeing if they're right or wrong, and they're figuring it in on these smaller countries, and a year or two from now, they will have worked it all out and we'll see the answer in North America. But I think it's going to take them a year or two to figure this out, because it's really hard. But they're keenly motivated, because they're trying to get the growth going again.

Lenny (40:17):
I was trying to watch Super Pumped on Showtime recently, and Showtime wasn't working, and I have to call my dad, because I'm leaching off their cable login account. And turned out that they moved and they changed their cable plan, and I'm probably the reason they're keeping a lot of it.

Gibson Biddle (40:32):
Well, so, Lenny, I was thinking about it. I'm open. I don't know the answer on this one, but just you and me comparing notes, what do you think? This is the kind of behavior that I love all product leaders to engage in. I call it building your personal board of directors. You're on mine, because I've been learning a lot about newsletters from you, right? Super helpful.

Gibson Biddle (40:51):
But when I would have questions like these, I would reach out to my pals, like, okay, what's the right level of investment on a mobile app versus desktop? That was a moving target for years. And I would just text my pals, and they would just give me the data. That's amazing insight, just by having peers in the business that you talk to, which this is the behavior that I want everybody out there engaged in. I call it building your personal board of directors.

Lenny (41:14):
I'd love to hear a little bit more on that, actually. How do people do that? Is it pick a few people on a topic and have them as your standing board?

Gibson Biddle (41:21):
I didn't even know I was doing this. This concept began for me, I was probably 30-ish. 30, yep. I got promoted to VP and I asked my CEO, "How do I learn how to do the job well?" And he said, "I don't know. Reach out and build your community of peers." Like, oh, that was good advice. It really was.

Gibson Biddle (41:39):
So, at any moment in time... You actually had one of my board members on a podcast, Melissa Perri. She's on my board, right?

Lenny (41:46):
Amazing.

Gibson Biddle (41:46):
Yeah, you voted for her. So, short answer is, it's really easy to build your community of peers. Just keep up your former colleagues. Keep up on LinkedIn. The harder part is building the mentors. And the first rule of thumb is, don't ask a person to be your mentor. That's really awkward. First, identify them. Say, this is a person I think that could be helpful to me. And then, find ways to be helpful. Everybody needs help. Everybody, everybody, everybody.

Gibson Biddle (42:13):
So, to help you understand the kind of help I need, my greatest fear is aging ungracefully, right? So I'm trying to understand what's going on. Okay, I asked you earlier, should I be on Discord, right? Like, oh, crap, do I have to be on Discord? But in many cases, somebody can help me to understand Discord. That's super helpful to me. And that's how those sort of mentor relationships eventually end up, and between the peers and the mentors, the mentors can help you to see around corners.

Gibson Biddle (42:43):
Actually, my favorite story of somebody who did approach me, they were in data, they wanted to be in product. They kept asking me, "Hey, do you have any startups I can work with on the weekends?" That's a good idea. I didn't have any answers. I got sort of frustrated with them. I said, "Just build me a website, a baby website." He said, "I can't build a website." So I gave him my credit card and said, "Get on Squarespace." If you go to GibsonBiddle.com, that's my baby website that John Lou built for me. That was incredibly helpful to me. Someday I should get a real one, but I've decided it's not that important.

Lenny (43:13):
I also have a baby website on Squarespace.

Gibson Biddle (43:15):
Exactly.

Lenny (43:16):
We're in good company.

Gibson Biddle (43:17):
Anyways, that's the concept of a personal board of directors. It's really important and helpful career advice in the long term.

Lenny (43:23):
Awesome. I'm glad we chatted about that. That wasn't something we planned to chat About. Something else I wanted to dive into, beyond strategy, is prioritization. You have a really great model for our prioritization called the JAM model, that I share often with folks. I'd love to just kind of hear your overview of this model, and when it makes sense, and just roughly how to use it.

Gibson Biddle (43:39):
Yeah, well, it's a lot easier because it spells something, right? As opposed to saying... I'll just give you a good case. I joined Chegg 2010. We were inventing a concept of renting textbooks to students instead of buying them, saving them a lot of money. And my first week was challenging, because on one end of the hall, the CEO, Dan, was saying, "Grow, baby. Grow. The most important thing we can do as a startup is grow." And at the other end of the hall, I had my CFO partner, Greg, saying, "Slow, slow, slow. We actually don't know if we have a business model that works." And I could tell he was sort of, the company's got like 40 people, sort of driving folks crazy.

Gibson Biddle (44:15):
So, as the product leader, what the heck should I do? And the answer was, I got them in a room and I said, "Listen, I just need you to force rank these three factors for me: growth, engagement, and monetization. And I need the two of you to agree." So, you could say growth is most important. When we say growth, it's basically year over year customer growth. Do you want it to be 50% or 10%?

Gibson Biddle (44:40):
Whatever the answer is, engagement is how I think about product quality. A more engaging product is a better product. So if you think investing in building a better product is super important, then you go with engagement, and the proxy metric that I use for that at Netflix was retention. And then, the third is monetization. You have these customers, you have this product, and how much effort do you put into turning that into a business?

Gibson Biddle (45:04):
So, Dan said, "Well, that's easy. Growth, engagement, and monetization." And Greg said, "Yeah, that's easy. Monetization, engagement and growth." He did the flip, right? I'm like, "I'm going to come back in two hours. You guys got to fight this out." Which is sort of what happened.

Gibson Biddle (45:19):
So, they agreed on growth first, engagement second, monetization third. And then, a couple months later, it started to happen again. Greg started to say, "No, no, no." And so, it was that point that Greg actually left the company. Which was, these are the kinds of fundamental misalignments that can wreck startups. I'm not saying that one or the other was right or wrong, but as leaders in the organization, we've got to get some of the basic stories straight, including how do we fundamentally prioritize growth versus engagement versus monetization?

Gibson Biddle (45:56):
This is really the number one source of misalignment that I discover among startups. And startups, you're always flipping back and forth between growth and engagement. Grow faster, build a better product. Grow fact forth, and then later, you get a little later to monetization. But this model, I find it super helpful to get leaders across an organization fundamentally more aligned.

Lenny (46:17):
So, if you're a PM, or maybe a founder, thinking about using this model, would the first step be get your leaders above you to kind of align with you on, of these three things, here's how we stack rank it?

Gibson Biddle (46:27):
Personally, I'd start with a SWAG. I would take a shot, a stupid, wild-ass guess of what I think is right, so at least I started with a point of view before I shared it with my team. And frankly, the next most important thing that happens is, if you're trying to create a metric focused organization that appreciates data and learning through numbers, deciding, I mean, the hardest one is, what is your engagement metric? How do you measure product quality?

Gibson Biddle (46:52):
At Netflix, it's monthly retention, but that's a hard conversation. The growth story's pretty, like, it's usually some percentage year over year of customer growth. I mean, but it's always different, but the only variation on what you said was, have a point of view yourself, and then get everybody's feedback.

Gibson Biddle (47:07):
That's frankly, when I would join a new company, I would give myself two weeks to develop the product strategy for that company, which is a little outrageous, but I would just do it fast. I would develop the SWAG, but then I'd go to one person. "Hey, this is my best thinking, what do you think?" And of course, they had been there for four years. They were much smarter than I, and they would refine my thinking.

Gibson Biddle (47:25):
I'd do that one by one, and then maybe six weeks later, I could share a product strategy across the company. But this is the value of a SWAG, which is a stupid, wild-ass guess. And don't be afraid to start at that level.

Lenny (47:36):
I really like that strategy, versus going in a little hole, spending months just thinking about the perfect answer, and only then presenting. I find this works better.

Gibson Biddle (47:44):
We're hiring a consulting company to do it. Go shoot me, okay?

Lenny (47:47):
I like that you're hiding your mouth as you say that.

Gibson Biddle (47:50):
Yeah. Only Lenny can see. Yeah, but this is a podcast, Gib. Nobody can see you.

Lenny (47:54):
Yeah. I will reveal. Okay, so on that topic actually, I'd love to transition and talk about our last topic, which is around career, or product manager. So, you're the CPO at two very successful companies, or maybe you're called the VP of product, but roughly a head of product. You have these two muckety mucks, right? Chief Muckety Muck. And in theory, this is kind of the end state of a PM career if you stay along the path. A lot of PMs go on different paths, but in theory, this is kind of where your career is heading. What would you say it takes to become a CPO someday? What kind of skills do you think you need to build that are maybe not obvious to someone that's not in that role yet?

Gibson Biddle (48:28):
Yeah, let's take a little step by step. Individual contributor, and then to manager. When you're just starting, you're just trying to learn the job. And I'd say, at a high level, you're just trying to optimize for learning in your entire career. But for individuals, building products is hard, and there's a number of technical skills that are required. So yes, some technical, but a lot of creative skills. There's some consumer science, that's the A/B testing. There's the management. How do you get people working together to actually build stuff? These are technical design skills, right? These are the technical skills.

Gibson Biddle (48:59):
So, early in your career, you're just trying to learn the job. And by the way, the job is hard. And second, it's different from every company to company in different stage. So you, Lenny and I, we're just trying to be helpful in a leveraged way. But the key thing is, the job's a little different in everything. So, just try to become expert in your area, expert in whatever your one thing is that you're building.

Gibson Biddle (49:19):
And then, the next step to become a manager is, there's a lot of, communication is sort of the heart, and that's why I try to... Product strategy is a great way to communicate what's important and what's not, try to demystify it. If you're early in your career, ask if you could be on interview teams, even if you're not hiring, because then you're starting to practice something that's really important as you want to grow your career later, which is it's really hiring and recruiting people.

Gibson Biddle (49:45):
When I was in the thick of that, I spent one to two days a week hiring and recruiting. It's really the most important thing. And then, some amazing opportunity would come along at the company and they'd say, you know what? Maybe somebody on Gib's team should do it, right? Because they knew I could replace people. There's always somebody new to pop in. So, I really was expert in hiring and recruiting later in your career.

Gibson Biddle (50:07):
If you want to be a muckety muck, my theory is the skills of a leader are the same, whether you're head of product, or the chief financial officer, or head of data. When I'm interviewing any of those kinds of candidates, I am looking for leadership skills. Can they do inspired communication of a vision? I do look for product strategy skills. That helps you to frame what that vision is. I do look for management skills. Have they built and managed teams?

Gibson Biddle (50:38):
I look for people who are proactive, results oriented. For me, leaders lead. You can't be a follower. So, I look for really proactive, results oriented folks. And this is pretty nuanced, but later in career, I look for folks who understand how important culture is, because culture helps people to understand the skills and behaviors that are wanted of everyone within the building, and they let you provide leadership in a highly leveraged way, instead of using evil processes and meetings and rules. I look for people who appreciate culture as a tool to help lead organizations.

Gibson Biddle (51:18):
And then, of course, they had to grow up as a builder. They had to learn all those damn technical skills for product manager. If I abstract outside of all that, honestly, the thing that I probably did best, I think maybe I did three things best. To know me, I was an English major. I'm non-technical, and I didn't care. First I was in marketing, and then I went into product, which I just loved.

Gibson Biddle (51:37):
I think I did a good job with sort of optimizing for learning. Actually, one of my hacks was, I started doing talks. I used to call it Topic This and That, on Friday mornings, about something I had just learned. That was the easiest way for me to learn something. So, optimized for learning.

Gibson Biddle (51:50):
We talked about building a personal board of directors, and that has been incredibly helpful for me, and that probably gets to the third thing. I was a pretty good picker, and the reason I was a good picker of companies is, I would lean on my personal board of directors. Some of them were CFOs. I'm like, "Hey, Barry, I'm thinking about joining this startup, Chegg." Hey, as a CFO, as a VC, would you invest in it, right? It's the same question I have to ask, should I invest my time?

Gibson Biddle (52:16):
So, I had people like that who helped me to isolate, was Electronic Arts a good company to join in 1991? Yes. Was Netflix a good company join in 2005? Yes. Was Chegg a good company to join in 2010? Yes. So, I was fundamentally a good picker, and I would really give a lot of credit to that personal board of directors that I had for that.

Lenny (52:36):
What about just day to day as a PM, what have you found to be really good habits, and kind of like a routine that PMs follow, that you've seen to kind of contribute to the success of an ICPM, especially?

Gibson Biddle (52:49):
My short answer is, begin your day with intent, okay? What are the three to five things I'm hoping to do today? Second, minimize meetings, okay? Minimize meetings. That sucks the life out of everybody, including you.

Gibson Biddle (53:03):
Spend a lot of time with your customers. It could be focus groups, it could be usability, it could be looking at survey data, it could be digging the dirt to understand their behavior to the data, and it could be designing and executing A/B test results. Those are all ways of becoming the voice of your customer, and that's a big part of your job as a product leader.

Gibson Biddle (53:24):
Find a balance between doing and thinking. Most of us do, do, do. Occasionally stop and ask yourself, okay, what's important here? What should I really be doing right now, as opposed to the things that I enjoy doing? Self-managing yourself. The only reason people need managers is that we need someone to force us to do the things that are important that we don't enjoy doing. So, I'm always self-managing myself. Gib, you have to do an invoice. Crap, I've got to bill people. That's no fun, right?

Lenny (53:56):
That inside voice, inside Gib.

Gibson Biddle (53:57):
Yeah, that invoice voice. Yeah, our in-voice. Gib, you should write a damn book.

Lenny (54:02):
Or not.

Gibson Biddle (54:02):
We're ignoring that inside voice. Yeah, you and me both. And then, I don't know, for me, exercise is awesome for me. It keeps me happy. And don't watch too much TV, and I watch too much TV. So, there you go. And don't do what I do. Do what I say.

Lenny (54:17):
Right. Yeah. I also probably watch too much TV. Funny coming from someone that helped build Netflix, but I totally get it. So, too good. It's too good.

Gibson Biddle (54:25):
Well, my wife's trying to cure cancer. She's like, "Oh, congratulations, Gib. You helped invent binge watching, you idiot. What good are you doing for humanity?"

Lenny (54:34):
Oh, man. Brings us delight, and that's valuable.

Gibson Biddle (54:37):
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.

Lenny (54:39):
Final question. You've had this illustrious career. What's one piece of advice that you'd give a PM in the beginning stages of their career, and then maybe as a bonus, I want maybe mid stage. What comes to mind?

Gibson Biddle (54:50):
Yeah, I think I did the early stuff. Pick the right company. At some point, understand that you are responsible for your career, not your workplace. And that's one of the reasons I encourage people to start building that personal board of directors, so you can compare notes. The other thing I say is, don't listen to your parents, because they're a generation ahead. They really don't know what the future looks like. I mean, I know I would give bad advice to my daughter, and so don't listen to your parents.

Gibson Biddle (55:16):
And then later, ever since I stopped direct deposit, I think of myself as just purely career hacking. So in your career, it's just a lot like building a product. You have theories and hypotheses, you find ways to experiment with them, and then you were successful or you failed. So one of my hypothesis, whenever it was, six years ago, was I would enjoy teaching. I actually tried it. I taught at Stanford, entrepreneurship for graduate level engineers, and I really liked it, but I didn't love it, largely because I was required to be in Palo Alto every fall. I couldn't travel as much as I like to, right?

Gibson Biddle (55:52):
Okay, so on one hand, okay, don't teach in the classroom, and my next vector was, what if I teach outside the classroom? That's what I really love to do. I do talks, workshops, all around the world in the last two years, virtually. I just love doing that, and I have a ton of flexibility. So, that's just a little example of me treating my career like, what's my hypothesis? Finding where to experiment with, and then, based on the results, do the next thing. And I've really been doing that my entire career,

Gibson Biddle (56:16):
So, if you embrace this idea of experimentation, you're like a product, you need to have hypothesis, you need to try see what works. The next thing you need to do in building a product or building your career is be bold. So, don't wimp out. At some point, when I'm working with different companies, they all kind of get attracted to the small, incremental wins, and they sort of forgot what made them a successful startup in the beginning, which is taking on fundamental risk. And so, I just nicely encourage people to be bold, to go a little bit out of your comfort zone, because that's where you learn more, and that comes back to this idea of optimizing for learning.

Gibson Biddle (56:52):
Anyways, and how do you encourage people to be bold? How do you encourage them to try new things? And the simple thing is, just start. Try it tomorrow. For me, the baby step was when I, on talks, I would just ask my friends if I could drop by and do a talk. I just did it. I didn't overthink it. I didn't spend 97 years setting up my display and getting the right clicker. I just gave a really bad talk. But that's how I started, and then I sort of optimized from there.

Lenny (57:21):
What a perfect way to end our chat. Really inspiring and helpful advice that I'm going to try to re-listen to and use myself. Just to close, where can folks find you, reach out to you, and then also just, how can listeners be useful to you?

Gibson Biddle (57:33):
That's a great question. Thank you. The first, I would say that Lenny has been a mentor for me in "Ask Gib" Product Newsletter. So, I reached out to him via a Twitter and asked him lots of stupid early questions, so he was incredibly helpful. So, probably the most important thing is to know that I write a newsletter every two weeks. That's the cadence I'm on now. Lenny knew me at the beginning when I was doing dailies. He's like, "Dude, don't burn out." It's called Ask Gib. I've answered like 63 questions so far. I really have enjoyed it.

Gibson Biddle (58:04):
Second thing would be my baby website GibsonBiddle.com. I have the advantage of being the only Gibson Biddle on the internet. I'm sure you're the only Lenny, but nobody can spell your last name, right?

Gibson Biddle (58:15):
Yeah, and then the third, how can people be useful? I'm a feedback freak, so you'll notice at the end of every talk I do, every essay, whether you find me on Medium, or Ask Gib, wherever, there's a link to give me feedback. And it's always the same question: On a scale of zero to 10, where zero sucks, 10 is excellent, how likely would you be to recommend this to a friend?

Gibson Biddle (58:38):
That has been incredibly helpful to me, and that's how I've learned to slowly get better at everything I do. The insight I get each day from folks is amazing. And I'll ask one follow up: but what'd you like, and what could be better? And it's just been incredibly helpful. So, don't ignore that link at the end. Don't treat it like United Airlines asking how is your flight? This is important, damn it! And your feedback is incredibly helpful to me, so thank you.

Lenny (59:04):
I'm going to go answer some of your surveys now. Thank you so much for doing this. I learned a ton, and I really appreciate your time.

Gibson Biddle (59:10):
That was great fun, Lenny, and thanks a ton for your help with my Ask Gib newsletter, as well.

Lenny (59:15):
Forever and Ever.

Gibson Biddle (59:16):
Okay, cool. I'll hold you to that.

Lenny (59:19):
That was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoyed the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at LennysPodcast.com. I'll see you in the next episode.

# Scaling Duolingo, embracing failure, and insight into Latin America’s tech scene | Gina Gotthilf

## Transcript

Gina Gotthilf (00:00:00):
Communication is constantly underrated.

(00:00:02):
And communication isn't about being able to convey a message, it's about being able to convey a message in a way that the listener receives it, and understands it, and remembers it. And that's really hard to do.

(00:00:13):
One of the things I've helped employ at Duolingo that I think is still there today, it's definitely not just me, it was an amazing team, is a unique voice. And what that means is not just another language learning app where we give you instructions and you follow directions.

(00:00:25):
There is always a quirk, like it's unexpected. The way we talk to you is a little bit funny. It doesn't take ourselves too, seriously and it makes the person receiving this message feel something. Again, it's about how you make people feel. And you feel like either you giggle, or you're like, wait what? They just did what? And using that to your benefit.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Today my guest is Gina Gotthilf. Gina is most known for leading growth and marketing at Duolingo, helping take them from 3 million to over 200 million users, primarily through organic and non-paid growth channels, which we explore in depth.

(00:01:01):
She also worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign, where she oversaw a historic digital ad budget, and she shares learnings from that experience. She also led growth in community for Tumblr in Latin America.

(00:01:12):
Currently, she's the co-founder and COO of Latitude, which is a company dedicated to helping build the next generation of iconic tech startups in Latin America. In our wide-ranging conversation, Gina shares a ton of new insights and tactics on how Duolingo grew early on, how they grow today, and most interestingly, what they did to become one of the very rare successful consumer subscription businesses.

(00:01:35):
We also talk about how every life and career has an A-side and A B-side. Also, why PR and brand are way underappreciated by most startups. She shares a bunch of stories of failed experiments, and also some of her biggest wins. Also, why Latin America is so interesting right now as a hub for startups and for innovation. Also, there's a bit of philosophy sprinkled in, and a bunch of real talk.

(00:01:58):
This was such a fun conversation. Gina is delightful. I am excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Gina God Gotthilf, after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:09):
You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-Day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

(00:02:26):
A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road-mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian.

(00:02:36):
With Jira product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place, and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds. And it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team's already working, so true collaboration is finally possible.

(00:02:56):
Great products are built by great teams, not just engineers. Sales, support, leadership, even Greg from finance, anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free. No catch. And it's only $10 a month for you.

(00:03:12):
Say goodbye to your spreadsheets and the never-ending alignment efforts. The old way of doing product management is over. Rediscover what's possible with Jira Product Discovery. Try it for free at atlassian.com/lenny. That's atlassian.com/lenny.

(00:03:29):
This episode is brought to you by Hex. If you're a data person, you probably have to jump between different tools to run queries, build visualizations, write Python, and send around a lot of screenshots and CSV files.

(00:03:42):
Hex brings everything together. Its powerful Notebook UI lets you analyze data in SQL, Python, or no-code in any combination and work together with live multiplayer and version control.

(00:03:54):
And now Hex's AI tools can generate queries and code, create visualizations, and even kickstart a whole analysis for you, all from natural language prompts. It's like having an analytics copilot built right into where you're already doing your work.

(00:04:07):
Then, when you're ready to share, you can use he's drag and drop app builder to configure beautiful reports or dashboards that anyone can use.

(00:04:34):
Gina, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Gina Gotthilf (00:04:39):
Lenny, I'm so excited to be here. It's been awesome to see how you've built this, and just how far it's gone. Thank you for inviting me.

Lenny (00:04:47):
Really appreciate that. I'm more excited to have you on the podcast. And I know you just came off hosting a massive event somewhere in Latin America, I think you had 5,000-something people. You had Ben Horowitz keynoting.

(00:04:59):
And I wanted to start with the talk you gave. I think you described it as people having this A-side and B-side to their life, kind of like a record as an A-side and B-side. So could you just share what it was this conference? And then two, kind of just briefly share this concept as much as you can

Gina Gotthilf (00:05:17):
For sure, and thanks for that Lenny.

(00:05:18):
Look, I think for those of us here in the US, I became an American last year. I love the US. I've been here for 19 years. It's hard to imagine just how much is going on south of the border. There's actually 660 million people living across Latin America, and it's an economy of $6 trillion.

(00:05:36):
And Brazil is a huge market, just in terms of sheer size, over 200 million people. And also in terms of where the ecosystem is. I am Brazilian, so I am Latin American, even though sometimes Brazilians are not sure if they are Latin American because we speak Portuguese.

(00:05:52):
And so the future of the region really matters to me. And helping people get the opportunities that I've had, in terms of access to information and resources that could help them build scalable, very successful startups, can really change the economy across the board. I believe in that much more than I believe in government, and whether we're going to vote this guy or that guy next.

(00:06:14):
And so that's sort of the impetus for the company. The conference was a conference put together by my company. I'm a co-founder. We're three, Brian, Yuri, and I. We put this conference together to bring together the top entrepreneurs, operators and investors across Latin America, but also people who are interested in investing in the region, of which there are more and more here in the US and abroad.

(00:06:34):
More than 5,000 people came. We had over 70 speakers. It was across two days. We had amazing people like Ben Horowitz, who never gave a talk, or did a fireside specifically for and about Latin America and the opportunity. But we also had incredible founders who you, in terms of US operators, may not be as familiar with.

(00:06:54):
But if you've ever heard of Rappi, it's a really important delivery company in Latin America. So the founder of Rappi flew down from Miami for that. And then we had VCs from a lot of the top names that you've heard here in the region as well. And then a lot of unicorns. We've had a lot of unicorns in the region.

(00:07:09):
So they were all there. And the idea was to share learnings along the way, successes and failures, so that people can skip by not making the same mistakes as others. And I was asked to open both days. And then the first day, the opening talk that I ended up giving was this concept that I really like, which is the A-side and the B-side of a story. Which is that if you are old like me, and maybe you Lenny, I think we're similar age, you remember what a CD or what a mixtape was like. And we had the A and the B-side.

(00:07:41):
We are very encouraged in our lives, especially professionally, to talk about our A-sides all the time. Because that's what impresses people, that's what opens doors, that's what allows us to keep growing and it's so important. It means that a lot of what you hear in podcasts and on stage ends up being the Instagramable version of someone, or a company, or a country's trajectory. It's just the highlights.

(00:08:06):
And when I talk about my A-side, it's very impressive. I did things like we'll talk about, I met President Obama, I worked on the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign. I helped Duolingo scale from three to 200 million users. I worked with Tumblr, helping them scale in Latin America. Andreessen Horowitz invested in my company, et cetera.

(00:08:22):
But between all of those highlights, there were so many B-moments that get shoved under the rug because it's just easier for me and it's more impressive for others. But I really like to highlight those. Because I think that most of us have a lot of B-moments every day, every week, every month and every period of our lives. And it's easy to think that things aren't just not going to work out for us because we're in one of those B-moments, if we don't recognize them as moments.

(00:08:47):
And the story I ended up telling was how, much I have these A and B-sides that I don't talk about my B-side so much. Latin America also has A and B-sides. Because it's really easy to focus on, it's dangerous, we're behind the governments are a mess. There's financial insecurity.

(00:09:04):
But there's a lot of A side in there, and a lot of the A-side is the opportunity we have in terms of tech. Because in terms of percentage of GDP that tech occupies compared to other markets, it's very promising. We're at one third of India, one 10th of China, one 30th of the United States. Meaning that tech companies can grow a lot so that they occupy that space in terms of the GDP, which is believable. So that was the concept of the talk and the reason for this conference.

Lenny (00:09:34):
I love this concept. We're going to talk, as you expected about a lot of your A-side stuff. Is there any example of a B-side story of your life that would be interesting to share?

Gina Gotthilf (00:09:44):
Look, I think those are the most interesting, because they're funny or ridiculous. But I'll just say that I had a lot of B-sides and I still do. For example, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I actually, I thought I wanted to be an actress. I either wanted to be that person in SeaWorld who goes like this with a dolphin, this was before SeaWorld was canceled. Or I wanted to be an actress. But then my parents convinced me that I was probably not going to succeed because the odds weren't in my favor.

(00:10:13):
I applied to schools. I didn't get into any Ivy League, I didn't get into any of the top schools I wanted to go to. When I got to college, I actually ended up dropping out because I got so depressed, incredibly depressed. Couldn't get out of bed, depressed.

(00:10:26):
Ironically, I dropped out of Reed College, which is the same college that Steve Jobs dropped out of. So I was just destined for greatness. I knew it at that moment.

Lenny (00:10:35):
It all makes sense looking backwards, as he said.

Gina Gotthilf (00:10:37):
Totally. I was dropping out, being like, yes, this is exactly the path. No, I was miserable. I thought there was no path forward.

(00:10:44):
And when I finally went back and graduated, the college counselor looked at my curriculum and said, "What have you even done with your life? There's nothing to show for." And it was shocking. Because I was always the overachiever who wanted to do the maximum curriculum, and ace all of my classes, and do whatever. I did three diplomas in high school, the international, the American, the Brazilian. My one learning there that has stuck with me, and I think can work for other people too, is that it's not just about doing things that actually matter, and learning. It's about being able to tell the story, and it's about understanding what other people perceive as valuable.

(00:11:22):
I'm not talking about net value. But I'm talking about, if you want to grow in the world, it's understanding that psychology of how humans react to what you're showing them. So that was one lesson.

(00:11:32):
But then I went on to, I applied to a hundred companies. I didn't hear back from most of them. I finally got an internship at kind of like a tier B-slash-C digital marketing agency in New York City, because I wanted to live in New York so badly. And they forgot to apply for my visa on time, so I lost my visa and had to go back to Brazil.

(00:11:53):
And then I ended up leaving that organization to go work for another one. And I won't even go into the details of the shadiness of that company that I worked for, but then they ended up laying me off. So I lost my visa again, had to go back home. Found another opportunity, got fired that time. So there was just a lot of rockiness in my start that I don't think you would imagine when you see someone up on stage leading a conference for 5,000 people. That, I think, is important.

(00:12:19):
And even when I started working for Tumblr, I was like, this is it. I made it. This is a really interesting company. This is going to work out. That was super rocky because it was an early stage startup. So for example, they couldn't figure out how to wire money to Brazil. So I was not paid for six months. And at one point me and my colleagues were trying to get money out of the teller to pay contractors, because we had no money to pay them. And we borrowed money from people. And finally they also laid me off because they decided to sell to Yahoo.

(00:12:47):
And then I had to figure out, what am I going to do? No one's going to hire me. I've been fired and laid off so many times. This is all before I started an agency to help US-based tech companies and startups grow in Latin America, because I figured I was in this really great place to make that happen.

(00:13:02):
And it eventually worked for, well-known companies such as Duolingo. At the time, they weren't well known. They were a tiny little startup. They didn't have an Android app. And that's how I started working with Duolingo. Because their head of marketing connected with someone they had worked with at Flickr and said, "I noticed Tumblr grew a lot in Brazil last year. Can you recommend a company or an agency to help?" And they said, this girl. And I was 26.

(00:13:26):
And so that's how they connected me with Duolingo, and I started helping them grow in Brazil as a consultant. They were like, this is great. Can you help us grow in Chile, Argentina? And I was like, yes.

(00:13:35):
They were like, how about Mexico? And I was like, yes. Did I know anything about these places, Lenny? Did I know people there? No, but you can figure it out.

(00:13:44):
And then they ended up asking me to come on full-time, do that across the world. In Japan, China, Korea, Turkey, Spain, France, et cetera. And then to own growth, which ended up meaning communications, social media, government partnerships, anything to grow.

(00:13:58):
And then eventually became an AB testing growth engine with engineers, and PMs, and designers of which I knew nothing about. And even after that, I left Duolingo five years later, didn't know what to do with my life. You'd think, oh wow, you have it figured out now. You left Duolingo, you have the world in front of you.

(00:14:18):
And I'm like, maybe I can finally go work for nonprofits, which is what I actually wanted to do in the first place. Tried my hand at that, had a couple of experiences before going to work for the Mike Bloomberg campaign.

(00:14:29):
Working for the Mike Bloomberg campaign is impressive, but you know what? Mike Bloomberg didn't win. He's not the president. So that was not a successful campaign, if you really look at it. And yeah, latitude seems like it's a really promising path. But there's A days and B days.

(00:14:46):
So it's just a lot of that, and just staying resilient, and believing in yourself, and getting back on the horse when you fall on your face.

Lenny (00:14:53):
Amazing. That's such an important message. I think one of the threads from what you're describing, something that I think about a lot, is people kind of underestimate how long their career is. There's just so much time to do stuff, and for things to start to work.

(00:15:05):
This is going to sound really fancy, but I think Marcus Aurelius has this quote about how our life is actually very long, we just use it really badly. And we just waste a lot of our time.

Gina Gotthilf (00:15:14):
Wow. I think you're so right, Lenny and I love that. Because people are going around being like, life is short, life is short. But that's so true. We waste so much time. But also I think we don't recognize how much opportunity we have in front of us. And as a 26-year-old, I definitely thought my career was over. I was like, I blew it. And looking back, it's funny.

Lenny (00:15:33):
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I spent nine years at my first job, at a random company in San Diego in a startup. And I was like, what am I doing here so long? And it turned out that was really useful for the thing I did next. And then eventually, wow, things started to really take off.

(00:15:48):
So I think that's a really good lesson for people, just for a long time. This is my fourth career. I've switched careers many times. I was an engineer, then I was a founder, then I was a product manager. And now I'm whatever this is, whatever you call this thing.

Gina Gotthilf (00:16:01):
Okay, cool.

Lenny (00:16:03):
Yeah.

Gina Gotthilf (00:16:03):
I guess me too. I was an operator. I was a consultant. Well, I was an employee, I was a consultant. Then I was an operator, which is a fancy way to say employee at a startup. And then, now I'm a founder and a VC. And an angel, and whatever this is.

Lenny (00:16:20):
Awesome, awesome. So I think that's a really important takeaway. Just, there's a lot of time to do stuff. And don't stress if things aren't moving as fast as you want.

(00:16:28):
I want to try to bounce around between A side and B side in this conversation, that'd be a cool framework. And so we're going to definitely talk about Duolingo, and a little bit more about Latin America.

(00:16:36):
I wanted to touch on this Mike Bloomberg story. So what I understand from your experience there is, you deployed a historic amount of money into paid ads as a part of that campaign. I am just curious what you learned from running paid ads at that scale for a campaign or just broadly.

Gina Gotthilf (00:16:53):
So we deployed historic amounts of money in the campaign. It wasn't me, Gina, personally.

Lenny (00:17:02):
It wasn't just you spending that money, yeah.

Gina Gotthilf (00:17:03):
I think that's important to share. So my Bloomberg presidential campaign was spending roughly a million dollars a day. Which is crazy. And you can do a lot with a million dollars a day.

Lenny (00:17:11):
It's good to be Google.

Gina Gotthilf (00:17:12):
It's good to be Google. But yes, it's good to be Facebook. I'll share what I think is most useful here, and also what my experience ended up being.

(00:17:22):
Which is, they brought together a lot of great talent from across the US, especially in terms of tech. This is an organization called Hawk Fish, that they started working with the Mike Bloomberg. Basically, he created it. I don't know, it was embedded in there.

(00:17:37):
There were a lot of us who had large eagles, and had been sharks in our previous organizations, who had to figure out how to come together and work and in a very short amount of time. That was a very interesting experience, because it's hard to do that. It's not just important to be great and smart, but it's also important to understand how to most effectively deploy your resources and talent across an organization.

(00:18:02):
And that sort of takes a little bit of time to happen. And for a presidential campaign, I find that very hard to do, from that one experience. That said, it also meant that when you're looking at the paid ads, and the fact that we were deploying this massive amount of money, there were a lot of cooks in the kitchen when it came to figuring out exactly what we were going to do with those ads.

(00:18:23):
And how we were going to target them, and what are the campaigns we're going to run, and what's the copy, and what's the design? And after maybe a few days there, I realized that my best bet in terms of actually adding value was not to be another cook in the kitchen trying to figure that out, but to move into the next step of the journey, which nobody was paying attention to.

(00:18:45):
Which is, once you click on an ad, you land somewhere. And then whatever happens there is super important. Because if people then take the action you want them to take on that landing page, or don't, is definitive. But everyone spends all of their effort and money on the ads. And I think that this is true of almost everything. We forget to think about the step-by-step in growth, and what that experience looks like. And even just the second or third screen in an experience are as, if not more, important than the first one. Because that's where your "leaky buckets" can happen.

(00:19:17):
So if you're able to 2X the effectiveness of a landing page, you are able to actually, in a compounded way, increase the effectiveness of that first ad. So I spent a lot of time going rogue and figuring out how to make landing pages. Because the designers and the copywriters were all allocated to the actual ad.

(00:19:36):
So I was just there being like, I'm going to do copywriting and design, and figure out how we can increase these conversion rates. And the cool thing about that level of dollar deployment is that you're able to reach statistical significance very quickly.

(00:19:50):
Whereas in a company like Duolingo, where you already have a lot of users and you can reach statistical significance on an AB test within two weeks, at the Mike Bloomberg presidential campaign on a landing page, we could see that three times a day, so four times a day.

(00:20:04):
So I would be able to do something and be like, oh wow, this has a 3% conversion rate. And then get approval for a new version and deploy it and then be like, okay, we're at 6% now. And then actually improve. There was one day where I brought one page from three to 12% conversion rate with statistical significance. So that's, I think, the biggest benefit of having those dollar amounts.

(00:20:25):
I think the drawback, and that's the same for startups that have a lot of money to spend, is you start going a little wild in terms of like, oh, the world's our oyster. We can do whatever we want. And you lose sight a little bit about effectiveness, which is where growth is so magical.

Lenny (00:20:40):
What was that change on the landing page you did that increased conversion so much, do you remember?

Gina Gotthilf (00:20:44):
None of this is going to blow anyone's minds, I think, because it's very best practices. But it's easy to overlook when you're so focused on so many different steps of a process. The first one is making it mobile-optimized.

(00:20:56):
People who are working, are working on their computers, on desktop computers, even today. We forget that most people are looking at pages on our phones. And that has been the case for a while, and I think it's just increasing. So you need to make sure that that experience of looking at something on your phone, whatever your phone is, is great.

(00:21:11):
And what that means is from a landing page perspective, super simple. First, the core copy, the message and button need to be above the fold. Or, if you're not going to keep the button above the fold, which I still recommend, but if you're not going to do that for whatever reason, then you need to have a very clear indicator that there's something to scroll towards on your page.

(00:21:35):
The second thing, applies to both desktop and mobile, is people skim. And copywriters don't like to believe that, much like journalists don't like to believe that people just read headlines. It's just how it is. People are busy and lazy, myself included.

(00:21:47):
So you can write all of this beautiful messaging that you've thought through, but if people are not going to read it, it doesn't matter. So you have to approach a landing page with that perspective in as much as possible.

(00:21:58):
And so for me, what makes something particularly skimmable is first restricting copy a lot. And even copy that seems short is probably not short enough. Second, so people normally like to have a title, some sort of subtitle, and then an image and a button. Those are kind of core pieces of some sort of landing page experience. Having the title and the button speak to each other is really cool. Because if people only read the title and the button, they got it.

(00:22:24):
It can't be like, "Wouldn't you like the next President of the United States to blah blah blah?" And then a whole explanation of what. And then the button is like, I don't know, apply. Whatever, right? It's like, apply for what? Now I have to go read the thing and I didn't get it.

(00:22:36):
So just keeping those two things super speaking to each other. And then of course, making sure that that landing page speaks to the ad experience. And that's something that I think people do pay some attention to.

(00:22:47):
Finally, there's an element of emotion to it. Which I didn't get super deep in, but just very basic. My job was to create a landing page that made people ... So it was actually, funnily enough, before Covid hit the US. And then Covid hit the US. Half the people in the campaign got Covid on our sad goodbye Mike Bloomberg party. And I had already bounced, and I left New York. I was scared. I was like, the city's going to be a Petri dish.

(00:23:13):
And I spent months trying to convince the whole United States, as much as I could, that Covid was going to hit the United States. And there were going to be a lot of deaths unless we had a different president. And so I, of course, convinced myself very effectively that we were in grave danger.

(00:23:28):
And so to do that, we had images in the background of different sorts, Mike Bloomberg and whatever. But fear really inspires people, and that's just a truth about human psychology. Especially when it comes to a presidential campaign.

(00:23:43):
So having dark colors like black, having Trump in sort of a black scenario, kind of looking down and looking a little menacing is more powerful than having Trump looking ridiculous, for example. In the context of, we need to take action, otherwise there will be deaths because of this.

(00:24:02):
So it depends on the concept, but don't underplay the importance of understanding how people are going to feel when they see something, and whether that's going to lead them to take action. Keeping it super, super simple.

(00:24:13):
Because also the other thing I see is a lot of images. It is like, no, the image can't distract from your core message. It has to be a background thing that aids in the digestion of that message.

Lenny (00:24:22):
I feel like all these startups are going to start adding Trump, menacing Trump to their landing pages because they worked for you guys.

Gina Gotthilf (00:24:31):
Well, they're going to alienate 50% of the American population.

Lenny (00:24:34):
True. There's a few other things I wanted to dig into. One is obviously Duolingo, so let's just spend some time here.

(00:24:40):
So it's really interesting. With my newsletter, I've written over 200 posts. The number one, most popular post of all time, did not expect this, was about the story of Duolingo. And the way that the team reignited growth after it started to plateau.

(00:24:55):
This was by Jorge Mazal.

Gina Gotthilf (00:24:55):
Mazal.

Lenny (00:24:56):
Mazal, okay, cool.

Gina Gotthilf (00:24:59):
Jorge Mazal, yes.

Lenny (00:25:00):
Okay, there's the right pronunciation. And so...

Lenny (00:25:01):
There's the right pronunciation. And so clearly, there's a lot of interest in the Duolingo story. And you were there before Jorge. You were there really early. I think you were there from 3 million users to 200 million. That's what I hear you describe it as.

Gina Gotthilf (00:25:16):
That's right. That's my claim to fame.

Lenny (00:25:18):
Great. That's a large growth trajectory. So one thing I wanted to ask broadly is it feels like B to C subscription apps never work. They never last. There's so few success stories of consumer subscription apps. There's Duolingo there, Calm maybe, but I don't know, it feels like it's slowing down, Headspace, Grammarly. And there's a few that are okay, but most die. I guess I'm mostly curious, what is it that you think Duolingo did right to make it basically and continue to thrive, even these days?

Gina Gotthilf (00:25:56):
Very few people really believed that we were going to make it, not surprisingly. Even though we had this amazing team, et cetera, now it looks almost obvious, it's like B to C language learning just seems so niche. And plus education, there's no money in education. It's been stuck for so long. And what I kept hearing, "You guys, did you hear about Rosetta Stone? This solution already exists." So I think that there are a couple of things that really made Duolingo's success, which are very hard to replicate.

(00:26:25):
Number one, an obsession for the mission. That sounds cliche. I think a lot of founders and startup people like to talk about the mission, and I get it, and I think it's real. But I really mean it, because this obsession for solving a problem for hundreds of millions of people, and the problem wasn't just a vitamin. It was a problem in the sense that if you don't know English in today's world, your opportunities to get out of your socioeconomic zone are very diminished. More specifically, you can double or triple your income potential by learning English in a developing market like Latin America. And there are lots of those around the world. That belief that education should be free and that people should have access to that opportunity, not just in developing countries, but of course, also in the US really drove the organization in a way that drove how we built our marketing, how we spoke to our users, how we designed the experience, how we put barriers in front of taking decisions that would actually impact that mission. It helped our users rally around the business. It helped us hire the best people even if we were based in Pittsburgh and couldn't necessarily pay the Google dollars. So it's really hard to measure the importance of just really being obsessed about that mission. But I speak to a lot of education founders, ed tech founders, and I am very biased probably because of this experience. I will say that I had one of those, what's it called, the experiment where they looked at all of the shots that some plane got when it came back from war and then started fixing the plane. There's a name for this. And then they realized that-

Lenny (00:28:04):
I forget the name, but it's the pictures. The pictures are famous with the red dots.

Gina Gotthilf (00:28:06):
You shouldn't fix those spots because if they got back, they survived, they were missing the plane that fell. So I got to ride in a plane that survived. So I have, oh, it's called survivor bias, maybe?

Lenny (00:28:18):
That sounds right.

Gina Gotthilf (00:28:19):
I have survivor bias, but I really believe in this-

Lenny (00:28:19):
Survivorship bias.

Gina Gotthilf (00:28:22):
Survivorship bias. So if I speak to a founder and I can tell that they're building an ed tech because they believe that they will be able to make money from it, there's nothing wrong with making money, nothing. I want to make money. I think it's a capitalist world that we live in, and it's fine, but just that drive is what brings people to you, and it's what leads you to make long-term thinking decisions that really end up mattering. And it's what allowed us in many ways to grow organically versus with paid ads, which I think is crucial for an early stage tech startup. It's not the only thing, but I think it's one of them that's super important.

Lenny (00:28:59):
Just to follow that thread, that's something that I actually found. I wrote a post about this looking into of the ones that made it, what did they do consistently across them all? And one is just stay very lean and scrappy for a long time. Because to your point, it's so hard to build a big business, and you can't afford, like you said, the best people, you can't pay them as much as everyone else. So essentially it's just a long time of just being very lean and scrappy. That was the most consistent pattern across all these B to C subscription apps.

Gina Gotthilf (00:29:27):
Agree. And that's number two. When I was hired by Duolingo as a consultant and as an employee, my mandate was make Duolingo grow. Here is no budget. I had no budget. And people are shocked. They're like, "Oh, but when did you turn on the ads?" We're like, "We just didn't." Because I know this is between you and me, Lenny, I actually am quite bad at paid ads. It's just not a muscle that I ever developed.

Lenny (00:29:48):
We won't tell anyone.

Gina Gotthilf (00:29:49):
I'm only good at ... huh?

Lenny (00:29:51):
We won't tell anyone.

Gina Gotthilf (00:29:54):
Please keep this a secret. I think I could develop that muscle if one day I need it, but I'm particularly good at thinking about organic growth because I've had to, because that's what Tumblr and Duolingo required of me. And the logic behind it was, listen, with Duolingo, we started monetizing the platform very late, and it was a luxury because we had so much venture capital money to sustain us for a while. But we had some bets that we made in the early days that we thought were going to help really sustain the company, like translations that didn't end up panning out. And then the Duolingo English test that we started developing really early with Burr Settles, an amazing guy who basically was developing this test, we realized that was going to be super long-term. We didn't start really charging for subscriptions or having ads until, I don't know exactly, but something like year three.

(00:30:47):
So we didn't have an LTV, which meant that having a CAC made no sense. So that's number one. You need that CAC-to-LTV ratio that everyone talks about. That's an important thing. But it's more than that. First, I think there's the CAC-to-LTV ratio thing. The second thing is that even if you have a low CAC, I was just talking to an entrepreneur this morning, he was like, "Oh, we were able to hit a 10-cent CAC." And I'm like, "Yeah, but that grows." As you start targeting more people, the low hanging fruit dry out, and you end up having to pay more money. And then once you have those users coming in because of those paid ads, you can't cut it off because you still need that growth, because you're trying to prove to your investors that you're growing, or you need those users in order to continue AB testing or whatever. Then you become completely dependent, and it's really hard to turn it off. So it's almost like an addiction, that as much as you're able to limit in the beginning, the better.

(00:31:38):
And the third thing is that I really believe that ... I don't believe. I think we all know at this point that the most important thing for the growth of anything tech, maybe in general, is retention. Of course, you need acquisition, but retention is important. And I simplify it a little bit because retention, I don't think of it in terms of like, wow, I must retain this user. It's like, is this thing valuable or not? That's what retention is to me. Either it's actually providing real value or it's not. If it's providing real value, people stick around. It's as simple as that.

(00:32:11):
And if you don't force yourself to pay attention to retention and finding the users to whom this is the most useful really early on, you risk convincing yourself of metrics and glossing over some of this other important stuff, which means that even if you succeed at acquisition, you're just not going to succeed long-term because those users fall through. And you won't really understand why because you were building retention based on acquired users that weren't the ones who weren't necessarily going to ... And I don't mean to say that I don't believe in paid at all. I think paid has its value, I think especially when it comes to testing. Sometimes you don't have as many users as you need to run statistically significant tests. But with paid users you could, or you could just use paid ads to understand messaging and images and even value prop. On a landing page, that's super valuable. Or you find an amazing niche, and you know exactly who your target users are, and you figure out a way that makes sense. But then again, I would argue that if you found your perfect user and where they are, you should go figure out a way to get them organically, because if you can really provide them value, they would come and they would stay.

Lenny (00:33:16):
So far I've heard be really focused around a mission and be very clear about what you're trying to achieve. Two is just very low spend, essentially don't expect to grow this into venture scale business. Focus on a sustainable profitable business for as long as you can and constrain your spend basically. And then third is this focus on retention, which I think is a really important point. And this is true for any app you're building, but I think especially true for consumer business where people are just like, "Nah, this is cool. Okay, what's next? Okay, let's check out Snapchat."

Gina Gotthilf (00:33:47):
Totally. And I was going to have a different three, but I think it's related, so maybe we can add it as three B or four.

Lenny (00:33:54):
Three B. Let's do it.

Gina Gotthilf (00:33:56):
An obsession for the product. Again, sounds obvious but isn't. When we look back to products that existed before the internet, before the app store, you built this thing, you made it, and then you tried to convince people to buy it. That was it. So look, I made a chair, this is a beautiful chair. And then you spend all this money trying to get it out into the world, and people buy the chair. And you hire all these salespeople, and you hire an amazing marketing agency, and you try to sell the chair. It's no longer at all that because products are constantly in motion and evolving. And unless you're able to own that data and understand what it can tell you, you're never going to win.

(00:34:33):
So I hear a lot of people come to me and say, "Gina, Gina, we built Duolingo for this." And I'm like, "Okay, cool." And then they show it to me, and it looks exactly like Duolingo. And I'm like, "Okay, cool." And then I'm like, "How did you get to this design?" They're like, "Oh yeah, we used Duolingo." So I'm like, "Great." But then as I started talking to them, I understand they don't have the engineers and PMs there looking at Mixpanel or whatever it is that they're using every day, understanding how every single change is leading to other changes that enables them to ask the questions and come up with the hypotheses that allow them to get to the next step. So it's almost like they just copy-pasted something.

(00:35:09):
You know how I think of that? It's like those students who are able to copy the best student's answer on the math test, and then they get frustrated that they didn't get an A because the work wasn't there, but they copied the answer. But if you don't know how to do the work, you get another math question and you're not going to get it right. And so that I think still misses, and I would venture to say most early stage tech startups out there. It's certainly the case in Latin America, where people think they can outsource the code or outsource the growth, and they're not just looking like hawks at the quality of the data and statistical significance and running hypotheses and questioning them. And that rigor is a culture at Duolingo that was there from day one before me and continues to be there today.

Lenny (00:35:58):
Amazing. So I think if a listener is trying to build a subscription consumer app, I would suggest just rewind and listen to that again. I think there's so much gold there. And in my experience, I get a lot of decks because I do a bunch of angel investing. I just discount consumer subscription apps because they never work, except when they do once in a while. And so my advice is if you're building something in this space, just listen to exactly what you just said. There's a lot of important stuff, and actually internalize it. Stay really lean, stay really focused, obsessed with retention, obsessed with making sure the product is solving the problem you're going after.

Gina Gotthilf (00:36:33):
I'm so glad that you agree, Lenny. I really admire you. So it makes me very happy.

Lenny (00:36:37):
Well, we're both happy then. I wanted to switch to the B side, and I'm curious, what's a mess-up or a big mistake maybe that you made or your team made that was like, "Oh, wow, that was a big waste of time?"

Gina Gotthilf (00:36:50):
Look, a lot of things didn't work out. More than 50% of our AB tests didn't work out. We made bets that didn't make sense. I will say, though, that in the spirit of A and B sides, I, and think in general, we are really good at forgetting the B stuff. I talk so much about all the stuff that worked that it's hard to remember all of those moments that didn't actually work. And the thing that I tend to talk about, which is this mistake that we made as the growth team, is almost like one of those, when you get asked in an interview, "What's your biggest weakness?" And you're like, "I'm a perfectionist." It's one of those things that actually makes you sound good because it's the story about how my team really wanted to implement badges. We spent a lot of time playing all the games that were popular at the time, trying to understand how those gamification growth hacks that we could find in those apps would potentially overlay onto Duolingo and how we would do that.

(00:37:48):
And badges was just pervasive in all of the top games. And so it seemed like a no-brainer. But since we ranked all of our experiments in terms of ROI and return being how many users we think we're going to get from this, DAUs and time investments, it never made sense to focus on this, because we thought that the time sink would be too high. So I actually ended up not letting the team run this experiment for six months so that we focus on lower hanging fruit. So that's a mistake on my end. Then we decided to run this experiment in the most lean way possible. We're like, "You know what? There's MVPs, there's minimum viable experiments. We don't have to run a whole badges thing. We can just do something more simple and actually see if that leads to growth in an interesting way, and then we'll know."

(00:38:32):
And we ran this very simple experiment that was like, "You sign up and then you get a badge." And it was like this girl with a balloon, I don't know, she was happy or whatever. And of course, in retrospect, it led to no results, because no one is proud of signing up. It's not an exciting moment, and you don't even have badges to collect. You can't show it to other people. None of the things that make badges compelling were there, but we were like, "Well, we does it. It didn't work." And then we moved on. So we moved on for another, I don't know, eight months, and we didn't look back. And then when we did look back, first of all, at that point, we discovered that we hadn't been dogfooding, which also was embarrassing.

(00:39:06):
Looking back, we hadn't been dogfooding in the growth team. We'd just come up with hypotheses. We were super careful about prioritizing them and making sure that we were doing the best possible write-ups and all these things. But the dogfooding piece just, I didn't come from a product background. I was a marketer, and I didn't really understand the term dogfooding. But when we had a conversation, we were like, "You know what? If we had just tested that, we would have all known that this was a super lame badge." And I was like, "Why are we not testing our experiments?" And so that became part of our practice.

(00:39:38):
It's still relevant. I just had a conversation yesterday with engineers at Latitude. I haven't explained what we're building yet. Maybe we'll get there. But I was talking yesterday to engineers at Latitude, and they're awesome. In terms of product team, we have have the number eight employee at NewBank. You might have heard of NewBank, but it's this massive banking fin tech in Latin America, and we have people from other fin techs, and then we have this guy who's a lead PM at Twilio, and I was explaining to them why we should be dogfooding. And they were all like, "Oh yeah, we should dogfood." It's just easy to forget stuff like that.

(00:40:10):
So that was a mistake that we could have probably gotten to the growth that we got to with badges much earlier on. And not only did we get to growth with badges, but it became this amazing treasure trove of opportunity. Because once you have badges and people want them, you can now ask people to do anything like go find friends, go buy things, whatever it is. And so we impacted almost all metrics across the company positively, including some we hadn't expected, but it's easy to talk about a mistake that ended up being a win. So that's why I compared it to the interview thing in the beginning. But we tried making Duolingo a social app really early on and failed. It was called Duels, DuoDuels. You could duel.

Lenny (00:40:55):
Very clever.

Gina Gotthilf (00:40:56):
I know. We were clever, but people didn't use it, and we didn't figure out why. We tried making a Duolingo for Schools platform. We couldn't get it to pick up. I went and launched Duolingo in China, and it got downloaded by a million people in the first day, and then the app got blocked because of the government, and then we couldn't figure out what to do. And then everyone rated the app one star because it didn't work, and so then we had a lot of trouble actually recovering from that. We launched Duolingo in India and didn't realize because we couldn't have unless we went there, which we finally did, that most people set their phone UI in India to English, because typing in Hindi is hard, and of course there's a lot of languages throughout India. And we were making it so that when you downloaded Duolingo, whatever UI your phone was set to, we offered not that language for you to learn. That was your base language.

(00:41:48):
So we were telling people learn French, Spanish, German from English, and they were all trying to learn English, so they didn't find what they were looking for and they left. There were so many mistakes, and luckily I think we were able to bounce back from most of them in terms of how Duolingo is doing today.

Lenny (00:42:05):
Man, there's so much there. That was awesome. I like that you're like, "Oh, I don't remember any of my failures." And then like, "Oh, here's all these awesome stories." That was great. Just one thread there that comes up again and again in this podcast is the dogfooding piece, especially I think people don't trust their gut and personal instinct enough. I think a lot of times PMs are just like, "I need to do user research to understand what we should be doing." Versus just use the thing, see what feels wrong and keeps you from being excited and really trust that. I find that more and more. I don't know. When I read a thing and when I'm writing, I'm just like, "Oh, I don't like that. I should change that. I don't need to run this by three people." So I think that's a really good lesson there. Just don't underestimate the power of you just using it and relying on instincts and feelings you have when you're trying to use it.

Gina Gotthilf (00:42:50):
Totally. And that's so hard to do, especially when you're young. And I think I'll add that, especially when you're female as well, or maybe other minorities. It's just really hard to trust your instinct because you're constantly telling yourself, do I really know anything or am I just being lucky? But you have to, and I think that forcing yourself to pretend that you know answers and just finding out what this pretend person who would know all the answers would think is really helpful because it helps you develop your point of view, your voice, and to trust yourself, even when you're working on something that you don't fully understand.

(00:43:22):
As in we're building a banking platform at Latitude, I was looking at it, and they were having trouble understanding why people were having problems with wires. And I told them all about how I'm an idiot when it comes to wires, and I make these mistakes A, B, C, because I don't match the line. It's like, whatever. There's all this information you're supposed to input, and sometimes the information you get is not in the same order. And they're like, "Wow." And I'm like, "This is just me as a user making dumb mistakes." But that is our forte. When you're able to understand that when you don't get something, probably other people don't get it too at scale.

Lenny (00:43:56):
Absolutely. It's like if you're thinking about asking a question in class, many people are thinking of that same question, and they will appreciate you asking it. The other thing that stood out there, so the Hindi mistake you made, I actually made the same mistake with my podcast recently. I was noticing that the second biggest market of listeners is in India. So I'm like, how do I lean into that and help people in India find this podcast even better? So I added subtitles in Hindi to a number of the episodes and tweeted it being, "Oh, look at me go, I'm going to make this so great for people in India." And everyone's like, "We don't need this. We prefer English. People in tech in India, we know English."

Gina Gotthilf (00:44:33):
That's true.

Lenny (00:44:33):
"This is even harder." They're like, "I can read a lot faster in English, so please don't do this." So that was a really good learning-

Gina Gotthilf (00:44:39):
There's so many languages in India.

Lenny (00:44:41):
That, too.

Gina Gotthilf (00:44:42):
Really, it's crazy how people don't speak the same languages across the whole country, but also it means that people in India are fluent in so many different languages.

Lenny (00:44:52):
We live, we learn. I want to go back to the A side and just a couple more questions about Duolingo. You said that most of the growth was organic and you basically had to grow it organically. Is there anything that you can share that worked really well? Because everybody wants to grow organically through word-of-mouth. Is there anything tactical you did that really helped Duolingo that other startups can do and try?

Gina Gotthilf (00:45:12):
Absolutely. So first of all, I would actually say that AB testing and product-led growth is organic growth, because you're not spending money on it. And so the first thing that you can do, no matter what stage your startup is, is make sure that you are not overlooking the importance of people in your product team who really know how to evaluate data and how to use that and learn. And if you're too early stage, you're not looking at 5% growth, you're looking at 20, 30% growth opportunities. But I think that's number one.

(00:45:44):
Number two, actually, this is something I might have said is something that Duolingo did really well, but I think it goes hand-in-hand with mission. But throwing the mission thing aside, brand and PR. So the importance of building a lovable brand that really resonates with people and makes people feel something and want to stand behind an idea that's bigger than themselves is not easy to do, but possible and core to being able to increase word-of-mouth.

(00:46:19):
So at the bottom of this is the mission, which is Duolingo, the mission was always originally to bring free language education to the world, then to build the best education to make it accessible to everyone. I don't know how they're wording it today, but that's something most people can get behind. It doesn't matter if you think Bloomberg or Trump should be president. Do you think everyone should have access to great education? Most people would say yes. And so that's much more powerful than, do you want to download an app and learn a new language?

(00:46:48):
So if you're able to have that and things that you really believe in about what you're building that's changing lives or impacting the world, even if it is just helping business people do their jobs better in a way that's going to improve their lives and their ability to make a living, or it's going to improve a company's ability, whatever it is, the bigger idea behind it and focusing on creating something that people like, whichever your audience is. It might be a more serious audience and something like Duolingo, but for Duolingo it meant we have this owl, the colors, and then the way that the owl talks and the notifications and the emails that you get and the product experience.

(00:47:26):
All of that ties back into how people feel about your brand, which makes it so that people are more likely to talk about it, which makes it so that you are much more likely to get a reporter to write a story about you, if you have something that's meaningful outside of like, "Hey, TechCrunch, did you know that my app grew by 20% last month?" They're like, "I don't care." But if you're able to tell a story about people whose lives are completely transformed or something like that, that's much more interesting and has played an important role in, honestly, my work at Tumblr, at Duolingo, not my Bloomberg presidential campaign, but definitely Latitude as well.

Lenny (00:48:02):
That's amazing. I was going to ask, what does that actually mean, and how do you build a lovable brand? And so what I've heard so far is there's this personality and voice that was really fun that you all lead into make it not just a generic translation app. It's like, oh, this is really fun and interesting. And then this other piece is these stories of transformation.

Gina Gotthilf (00:48:21):
Yeah, there's more, there's more. So I think a brand that stands for something, that truly stands for something, that's where the mission piece comes in.

Lenny (00:48:30):
How do you communicate that? How do you people even know that the brand stands for that?

Gina Gotthilf (00:48:34):
So that has to be an integral part of your communication. In the early days, we tested a lot of stuff on social media. We made, again, mistakes. At one point we were posting photos of our team on Facebook being like, "Check out the behind the scenes." Guess what? No one cares. But we had a calendar, this is very tactical, but a social media calendar where one post a week is about effectiveness, because we knew that proving that Duolingo was an effective way to learn a language and actually having data behind that moved the needle. So making sure that was part of our communication in terms of our social media calendar, in terms of the PR pitches that we were making, in terms of whatever we were able to communicate out into the world, and then make sure that one post a week was something about the mission and what we were actually trying to accomplish.

(00:49:17):
But it also got embedded into a lot of things. For example, when we were testing screens to get people to convert into paid users on Duolingo, we found that including something like, "By paying for Duolingo, you're making language learning accessible to millions of people," that actually improved the metric. People cared enough to make the payment. So it really can be anywhere. In addition to that, I love copywriting, and I believe that communication is constantly underrated, and communication isn't about being able to convey a message. It's about being able to convey a message in a way that the listener receives it and understands it and remembers it. And that's really hard to do. And one of the things I've helped employ at Duolingo that I think is still there today, it's definitely not-

Gina Gotthilf (00:50:00):
I've helped employ at Duolingo, that I think is still there today, it's definitely not just me, we're an amazing team, but I've helped employ that I've used at Latitud in other places is a unique voice and what that means is exactly what you said, Lenny, not just another language learning app where we give you instructions and you follow directions. There is always a quirk. It's unexpected. The way we talk to you is a little bit funny. It doesn't take ourselves too seriously and it makes the person receiving this message feel something. It's about how you make people feel and you feel like either you giggle or you're like, "Wait, what? They just did what?" And using that to your benefit. We use that a lot at Latitud today as well in terms of especially our newsletter, just self-deprecating humor and that's what's helped us grow so quickly in Latin America in such a short amount of time. People identify with it, they see themselves as part of that. Again, much like the mission versus your company, and I'm a consumer.

Lenny (00:50:59):
This episode is brought to you by Mercury, who I also happen to use for my business checking account. I've tried a lot of business banks and there is nothing even close to the experience you get with Mercury. I moved cash over from another bank and it literally took less than half an hour to set up the account and wire money over at no cost. They kind of make you want to use the site more often, which I've never felt with another banking site. Mercury is banking engineered for the startup journey, a modern solution to help your company become the best version of itself and Mercury isn't just a place to hold and send money. It's software built to help you scale with safety and stability, whether you're a team of two or a team of 1,000.

(00:51:37):
Mercury also goes beyond banking to provide you with access to the foremost investors, operators and tools. Visit mercury.com to join over 100,000 startups on Mercury, the powerful and intuitive way for ambitious companies to bank. Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank. Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust members FDIC. Is there an example of that, kind of like a message you remember for either from Duolingo or from even Latitud or something that worked that was really funny or different?

Gina Gotthilf (00:52:09):
Look, I think for Duolingo we constantly looked at every copy we wrote and asked, "Could this have been written by other companies? Could this have been any other company or is it Duolingo? What makes this Duolingo?" And it was tough because the more people you hire who come from other backgrounds, they're not used to that style and they might even think it's unprofessional or whatever. You're like, "Nope, this is the Duolingo way." So, it helps figuring out, exactly what does that voice, what does it sound like? What are some words that it tends to use? Why yes, why not? What's too much, what's too little? In terms of specific examples, this is something that I didn't write myself, but I wrote a lot of notifications for Duolingo for the passive-aggressive messages that I'm sure people have received, which started and then became a meme and then Duolingo used as well, but the whole, "This doesn't seem to be working. We'll stop sending them for now," message, which you got after five days of inactivity. In addition to that message, around the same time we decided to send an email to people in New Year's because that's when people make a resolution to do things and we wanted them to make learning a language a resolution for the year. So, we created an email and it had Sad Duo because there was... I don't know if the screen is still there, I haven't used Duolingo in a while, but there was always a screen of Duo really sad when you fail something and that [inaudible 00:53:24]-

Lenny (00:53:23):
Duo the owl.

Gina Gotthilf (00:53:25):
Duo is the owl, sorry. The green owl will cry and we A/B tested the size of the puddle and the number of tears that came out of his eyes in terms of effectiveness. So, we used Sad Duo in one of those emails and then someone picked it up on Twitter and the passive-aggressive message and this Sad Duo, they started making their own versions, which was like, "Study now or Duo will eat a poisoned loaf of bread," or, "The next email will be a funeral e-vite," things like that.

(00:53:58):
And so that's an example, I think, to me, which can now be seen very much throughout Duolingo's brand where we could have just said, "Oh no, this is a PR disaster. We need to go back to being this friendly, nice little fluffy thing that everyone loves." Instead being like, "No, we get that people think this is funny and we're just going to run with it," because using the Duo voice, it gives us the permission to do that because we're not square, we're not going to do that thing that you read in the textbook in school. We're kind of going to play along with it.

Lenny (00:54:29):
That's an incredible lesson. It reminds me of this famous Duolingo meme that I'm sure you've seen where someone shared these... They got these two notifications in a row, I just pulled it up here, where first they got this Duolingo push notification, "It looks like you forgot your Spanish lessons again, you know what happens now," and then the next push was from their security system, "Intruder alert, backdoor, proceed with caution," and I imagine Duolingo even leaned into that, I think when this started spreading.

Gina Gotthilf (00:54:54):
100%, and it wasn't an easy decision because of course a lot of people in the company were really concerned about the brand image and, what are people doing and how do we revert this, that kind of thing. So, it was a bet that we made where we're just going to, "No, we're going to lean into it because that's what having this unique voice means. It's about getting it. It's about being part of something bigger. It's about connecting with people outside of just teaching them a word a day," or whatever it is. And with Latitud, I think we do that all the time in our newsletter and it's a lot of self-deprecating humor for Latinos and using expressions that could be almost offensive, but they're not in terms of Latinos only, but also the tech world, making fun of being a tech founder and the things that we do that we think are okay and it's just a lot of that where I think I would call it irreverent.

(00:55:45):
It's a tough line, it's a lot easier to be, I think, a copywriter in a place that doesn't want to do that because the lines are a lot clearer and you don't have to take as many risks, but it's so less fun, which I think makes it so less fun for the user because people are used to getting emails from their banks with corporate lingo that you don't understand, but if they get an email from their bank that's funny, ironic, but also very informative, that's a bank email I'm going to read.

Lenny (00:56:12):
I think that's a really good lesson. Part of this is just taking a risk. I think that's one of the big takeaways here is just take some risks. We had Lulu Cheng on the podcast who is a huge advocate of that. She is a PR comms person that's worked at Substack and Blizzard now, and that was her advice to people-

Gina Gotthilf (00:56:27):
Take risks?

Lenny (00:56:28):
Take risks, do things that are a little controversial because that'll get attention. I definitely want to talk about Latitud, just a couple more questions on Duolingo. One is, today feels like one of the most interesting things about Duolingo is their TikTok presence and it feels like they're doing so well, kind of leaning into exactly what you're talking about, just being really silly and different with the owl especially. I guess the question there is just, what is it that you think allows for that? Is it just this very special social media person they hired that was just incredibly good at this thing and being irreverent as you said, or is there something else that contributes and allows a company to win in social media the way that Duolingo has?

Gina Gotthilf (00:57:07):
Look, I haven't met the person who does a TikTok and they're fantastic. I definitely don't want to demerit their work. It's awesome, I don't think it's easy to do, especially on a consistent basis. So I think, yes, finding someone who gets humor, who gets the platform, who's able to produce content quickly, but also reacts to learnings, all of that is not easy to do. However, I do think that everything we just talked about is at the bottom of that because if Duolingo didn't have this unique voice and leaned into the humor and wanted to be irreverent as a brand and was so focused on connecting with people where they were and ready to take risks that might seem maybe unorthodox, especially in terms of education, then an opportunity to build a TikTok like that wouldn't exist. So it's both, and I think it goes back to the brand DNA, it goes back to the culture of the company and to the attention, as I said, to every single text that was published and whether or not it wasn't the right voice or not.

(00:58:06):
It has to do with having those conversations with the executive team where you talk about who is Duo and what are they like and how do they talk and what do they sound like and is this a Duo thing to say, is this not a Duo thing to say? And committing to this idea that you're going to be remembered, that you're going to do things that sometimes are going to rub people the wrong way, and you're not just going to sit squarely in one place. I think that opens the possibility for a TikTok like the one that Duolingo has today to exist, but again, whoever's running the TikTok, you're amazing.

Lenny (00:58:42):
That's such a good lesson. A lot of people are looking at Duolingo, we need to find that person at our company. And what you're saying is it takes a lot more than that. That person is not going to have a good time if the culture of the company isn't set up to be that... To have that approach to try to just take risks and be irreverent, so that's a really good point. One final question around internationalization, you said that you helped drive internationalization of Duolingo, and I read somewhere that one of the learnings you had there was essentially treat everyone the same almost across countries, which I think people think is the counter. They should often like, "No, we should be super personalized for every country we're in." What did you learn there?

Gina Gotthilf (00:59:22):
I think this is very controversial because not only is it the case that when you're working in regulated industries, maybe in more B2B situations, looking at specific countries is important. Looking at specific countries and elements of these countries are important, especially when you're looking at, I don't know, laws and if you need legal differences and there's a lot of things that make countries different is what I'm trying to get. However, humans are very similar and we think we're very different. I don't think we're that different. I think that maybe we were brought up differently, and so for example, in Brazil we like to dance. In Mexico, we like to dance salsa, in some places it's okay to hug and other places it's not okay to hug. Yes, there are cultural differences and it's important to love everyone and to adapt, et cetera, but a lot of these differences when it comes to core human behavior are that final 5% of understanding people.

(01:00:27):
And if as a startup, whether it be early stage, but as a startup you focus too much on those marginal differences between groups of people, you can run the risk of making big mistakes, which is making too many changes too soon and learning very little and adding crazy amounts of code complexity and overall organizational complexity to what you're building. And with Duolingo, because it was a consumer app, because we weren't dealing with a lot of regulatory issues, except for China where we had to watch out for certain words and phrases, in general, people want to learn a language and people learn a certain way and people use apps a certain way. So, there's a lot of commonality. We just found that by treating the world as one, and whenever we deployed an A/B test or tried something new in terms of marketing, we would just look at it as like, "Well, if this worked here, it will work there and we should just try it out everywhere," which meant every time I went and launched Duolingo new market, I got the same feedback.

(01:01:27):
Whatever country it was, "Here, it's different. People are different. You don't understand and what you're doing is not going to work and here's why you need to change." And if we had actually listened to that, it would cause all kinds of problems. In our country, we think that green is a negative color, owls are poorly seen as an animal, or here people think that free things are actually of low value, they like things that are expensive. Oh, people here really like free things and I'm like, "Everyone likes free things." They're like, "Oh, in this country..." Whatever, so yes, I think that countries are different, but it's more important to realize that people like to think they're different and people like to think their countries are different and highlight those because it makes them feel special, unique. We're all special and unique in all of our amazing ways, but this is not necessarily it.

(01:02:13):
And when you're trying to be super cautious of your resources, you have to ignore some of that because then you're able to roll out things once, which is important, but in addition to that, every new A/B test you want to run or every new hypothesis you have, if you now have a version of your app that's different in Mexico, in China, in India, whatever, you're going to have to run that test and whatever change you have in all of those versions, and then you just start having all of these different versions of the app everywhere and good luck managing that in terms of code, in terms of processes, in terms of personnel, in terms of costs, and most importantly in terms of time because now every single experiment or hypothesis is going to take you way longer to be able to deploy, and time is almost more important than money when you're a startup. So, it's important to keep things super simple, and this was something that we did that actually ended up paying off with few exceptions like India and China.

Lenny (01:03:12):
That is such cool advice. It reminds me of a quote that I think of that a friend of mine shared once, "Life is maintenance. Anything you add to your life is just something you're going to have to maintain from that point forward," and similar in products. Any time you add new code, you're going to maintain that code forever, and the more you can not add anything new and not make things really different, the easier everything gets. People forget that. It's like, "Oh, we're just going to spend a bunch of time to make it awesome in China or Brazil," and then, oh, they have to maintain that forever and every you feature has to...

Gina Gotthilf (01:03:42):
And it's an 80/20, so just focus on what will get you the 80 and not the 20. And then when you have the luxury of focusing on the 20, then you can.

Lenny (01:03:52):
So, speaking of different cultures and people being different but not that different, you pivoted your career basically to focus on Latin America. First of all, why did you decide to do that? That's a pretty unique path and what pulled you there?

Gina Gotthilf (01:04:09):
So Lenny, I don't see it as a pivot because as we were joking in the beginning, I've been an employee, I was an operator there at early stage startups and now I'm a founder and I'm a VC, so I'm still kind of in this little stack of roles that we have in our little tech ecosystem. And in my time working with Tumblr and my agency and Duolingo, I had the pleasure of speaking with entrepreneurs all over the world, in part because I started getting some media because of the work that I've been doing starting at Tumblr, so a lot of entrepreneurs reached out to me, but also because I became a mentor for an organization called Endeavor, which is global. So, I started working with entrepreneurs in Japan and Brazil on my free time, just mentoring. And I know that the opportunity for growth in terms of tech in Latin America is huge because first of all, the opportunity for growth in tech is huge all over the world, meaning there's just more and more to do.

(01:05:09):
There's more pieces of our lives that can become more efficient or better or cheaper by making them digital in some way, shape or form because digital products scale. We are behind when it comes to that in terms of Latin America, and our economy is also not doing super great right now. There's a number of things that make it tougher to succeed in Latin America, but make the outcome of potential success much higher. And simply put, there's a lot of low hanging fruit because a lot of what has already been digitized and productized in the US and more developed markets just hasn't in Latin America. And every time I took these calls, I would think like, "Well, this is not very efficient for me to be doing this one-to-one call. I feel very good about myself, I feel great, and this entrepreneur learned a lot, but I wish I could do this more at scale."

(01:05:56):
And also it doesn't seem like this is what's going to help this entrepreneur succeed. Maybe it's a little bit of advice, but it's like... And not only that, but I had a lot of experiences where I would mention something about growth that I had learned and that would blow the entrepreneur's mind. And I would think, "Why do I know this, but not this entrepreneur who honestly is smarter and more ambitious than me?" Oh, it's because I've had a career in Silicon Valley. It's because I've gotten to work with some of the best people in the world and I have access to this information just free flowing in my way all the time, and we take it for granted. So, how can we make this more accessible to Latin America's entrepreneurs, so that they can have access to that? What else is hard to get access to that could really get in the way?

(01:06:34):
Oh, like access to capital. So, what's the VC in the angel ecosystem looking like and what can we do that can actually impact that at scale? And then there's other pieces of the ecosystem that are missing, like if you're going to start a company, you have to incorporate it. It sounds super boring, but Brazil is one of the countries that takes the longest time to incorporate a company in the world, but then if you're going to get investment, you probably can't get investment in your Brazil entity because investors are like, "I don't know anything about Brazil, and sounds like a lot of employers get sued by their employees and lose," which is totally true, "And there's all this liability. I feel much more comfortable investing in a Delaware company." So then entrepreneurs are like, "Oh man, now I have to create this entity in Delaware. I don't even know where that is and what's the C-core? What's this other thing?"

(01:07:19):
So, there's just stuff that needs to happen for Latin Americans that we don't think about here, "Silicon Valley" talking about it as in the cloud in the US and developed markets, but also then you're able to raise money, how do you get money down to your country? That's not simple at all. How do you think about the FX transactions and not get screwed in the process and who's going to do it? And so anyway, there's a number of these things that make it super hard. And so, that's some of the problems that we wanted to solve.

(01:07:47):
Why it matters to me? I'm Brazilian, I'm Latin American, and I know that I had all of the opportunities in the world. I went to an American school, I got to go to school in the US, I got to work with some of the best tech companies in the world, and 99.9% of people in Latin America will not have these opportunities. And so for me, if I don't use this privilege to somehow make a huge impact where I came from, that will last, then I kind of wasted my life. So, that's why this matters so much to me, and I met my co-founder, Brian Requarth at On Deck. If you've heard of On Deck before, I'm a big fan.

Lenny (01:08:24):
I'm wearing On Deck socks right now. Yeah, I am.

Gina Gotthilf (01:08:28):
I love their socks, and I just had a conversation with them yesterday. I am a big fan of what they built. I met Brian doing On Deck... I actually was thinking of starting a completely different company, but also focused on community. As we were talking about, people want to find connection, and I think that there's a lot of business opportunity there, but I met my co-founder and he was working with our third co-founder, Yuri, who was actually the guy... We joke he's the guy who builds things.

(01:08:53):
He's the CTO, he actually knows how to build and started talking about what it is that we can do to make an impact in the speed at which tech startups succeed in Latin America because we think we can have a huge impact on the GDP of the whole region, developments, job opportunities, and so on and so forth. So to me, that's what motivates me. It's like figuring out how I can use my time as leverage to make the biggest impact possible in terms of socioeconomical mobility for people in the world and focusing on the part of the world that I came from made the most sense.

Lenny (01:09:26):
So you referenced this company, that you started Latitud. Maybe just describe briefly, just broadly, how do you pitch what Latitud does to folks that might find it useful?

Gina Gotthilf (01:09:35):
I will, and I still do a pretty bad job with pitching it, but the pitch is basically we're building the operating system for Latin American early stage tech startups, and what that means is that building a startup is hard anywhere, but it's extra hard in Latin America for some of the reasons that I outlined. Some of the things that we decided to solve for are one, it's super lonely to be a founder. And if you're able to meet great founders who are just a step ahead of you in anything, be it in product or growth or marketing or incorporation or finances, you can save yourself so much time from trying to read books and Google if they can just tell you what to do or connect you with the right person, that if we were able to connect these people meaningfully, we could make a huge impact.

(01:10:16):
So, that's number one, it's lonely. And number two, you build a startup in Brazil and you're like, "Wow, this is working. I'm going to go to Silicon Valley." I've seen this happen a lot in the past decade, and Silicon Valley is a completely different place. The US, it's a different place, the competition's different. 3% of people in Brazil only, and that varies in Latin America, speak English. So, the likelihood of you being taken seriously is low. Your chances of success are low, but at the same time, Latin America has so much in common as a region, but we don't actually actually see that if we're Latin Americans. We just think we're countries, especially Brazilians don't think that they're part of the rest, and Mexicans don't think about Brazil. It's so far, look at it on the map. In the US you're like, oh Latin America."

(01:10:58):
But if you're there, it's just not at all connected, but the opportunities of growth are huge and dependent on whether you meet the right people are able to open doors and understand that our problems are so similar that a solution for one part of this region could potentially be great for another part of the region. I'm not doing a great job of pitching, but in addition to it being lonely and it being difficult to find the right resources and really trustworthy knowledge, it's really hard to raise capital and it's really hard to do things like incorporate and bring your money down, et cetera. So, that's what we do. First, we have a fellowship program. We have 1,500 entrepreneurs who got in, we run four cohorts a year, about 600 applicants per, and so you get in and you get access to all of these resources we've put together.

(01:11:44):
You get to find out what everyone thinks about other investors in the region because I think it's important to disseminate that information. You get access to introductions to investors through each other and advice and events. In addition, we have a fund, so we've invested in 100 startups and we're raising our second fund now. It's going to be around $25 million with a $30 million cap, so that's another thing. So we invest, you figure out your investment game, but you might become one of our investments as well. And in addition, we have products that make it a lot easier to navigate the super, in my opinion, boring and frustrating stuff behind starting a company that you don't want to think about it as an entrepreneur because you're trying to solve a problem and build a team and build a product.

(01:12:25):
You're not trying to figure out what's the best incorporation method and how to open a bank account in the US and how to figure out the foreign exchange prices and bring the money down and how to manage that money or how to stay compliant in your country, and then in two other jurisdictions, if you have a Delaware and a Cayman. So, we do all of that for you and make it easy through a dashboard we built, a bank that we built, and so on and so forth. So, it's not an easy to describe business because it's kind of an ecosystem play. We're trying to elevate the tech ecosystem in Latin America, and it's a lot of moving parts.

Lenny (01:13:02):
You basically help them do everything, which is what I'm hearing, and it sounds like you'd be a fool not to take advantage of this. The customers essentially are founders in any Latin America country, is that right?

Gina Gotthilf (01:13:14):
Founders in Latin America, but we also have a lot of US-based founders who are building for Latin America because they understand that the opportunity there is huge.

Lenny (01:13:22):
Awesome, and then what is the arrangement? Do you take equity if they join the program? Is it free?

Gina Gotthilf (01:13:28):
We don't, joining the program is free. You just have to be able to get in. For a number of reasons, we just don't want to deter anyone who's amazing from being part of this community, and so that's why we made that decision. If we invest, we take equity. If you choose to use our products, that's a paid thing. So, you can choose what makes sense for you.

Lenny (01:13:47):
Something I wanted to ask about is what is it that Latin American founders and companies are uniquely good at? Is there kind of a thread across Latin American startups that are like, oh, they're so good at this area, pay attention here?

Gina Gotthilf (01:14:03):
In general terms, startup founders have to be really scrappy and resourceful and resilient. Latin Americans tend to be very scrappy, resourceful, and resilient because of just the realities in which we were brought up in. We have words for that that we don't have in English and Portuguese in Spanish, which is like dancing around things and figuring out things when you don't have other solutions. So, I think that's something that we see a lot. In terms of what we're really good at, I would say first of all, there's opportunity in every single vertical in Latin America because it's such a wide open field, so there's opportunity everywhere.

(01:14:40):
It's not that we're particularly good at FinTech, for example, but if you look at the FinTech opportunity in Latin America right now, it's so hot and there's so much money and there's so much happening because of the huge problem of people not having access to bank accounts or access to credit, or just all of the bureaucracy that exists in trying to get those things or to make payments and so on and so forth. So, there's just huge opportunity there. I'm trying to think what else-

Gina Gotthilf (01:15:00):
So there's just huge opportunity there. Trying to think what else I would highlight. Ah, Lenny, you talked about B2C. I think again, because there's so much open field, there's so much opportunity when it comes to B2B, especially when you're talking about SMBs. There's a lot of small and medium businesses doing things on paper, so figure out what they are and how you can make them not on paper and deploy them effectively. So I think that's an advantage we have.

(01:15:28):
Other than that, I wouldn't highlight anything in particular. I think that there's amazing people all over the world. It's just a matter of what are the opportunities that exist. And because there's so many opportunities that are Latin America specific or that are emerging market specific, which means that if they work in an emerging market in Latin America, they could work in other emerging markets. And you know what? Most of the world is not developed markets and understanding what it's like to not have access to amazing wifi and iPhones and all the things that we have access to, that can be a huge advantage because that's the reality that most of the population lives in. And that's a huge TAM.

Lenny (01:16:08):
That makes me think about WhatsApp. And one of the reasons they made it is they were just obsessed with making the app incredibly small and fast. And they started, I think with international markets and then that just ended up being an amazing app so fast and so easy to use.

Gina Gotthilf (01:16:22):
And still, and now there's things being built on top of WhatsApp. We just invested in a company called Leadsales, and they basically turn your WhatsApp into a CRM, which is amazing because so much business is being done on WhatsApp, and that's not the case here in the US. So you want to understand that you can build something for that. And there are other markets that are using WhatsApp for which that's also going to be useful. And the other thing is I think that emerging or developing markets tend to sometimes skip over things because we're so behind.

(01:16:48):
So for example, there's examples of these in India and in some countries in Africa where, I don't know, the desktop was skipped, people just went straight to mobile. I think we can see these catapult opportunities because then when you start building something and you didn't even build for the previous version of whatever it is that was being used because in the US or more developed market, you had access to them, then you are in a way at an advantage. So I'm excited to see how that plays out in the next few years, and I'm particularly curious to see how that plays out when it comes to AI.

Lenny (01:17:21):
One last question around Latin America. It's going to be a broad question. What do you think people should be paying attention to, whether it's specific companies you want to call out, big companies that are doing great or just trends or patterns, what do you think people should be paying attention to? Anything you want to shout out?

Gina Gotthilf (01:17:39):
Lenny, the truth is I would love to call out all of our portfolio companies. I believe in all of them, and there are some of them that are growing incredibly impressively. One of them is Pomelo, which is a FinTech platform for FinTechs that is just grown incredibly. To me, it's more about paying attention to Latin America. I think for the US, that's already a lot. I don't think people know what's going on below the border, I have no idea what Brazil is like, but paying attention because it's not just a place that's behind and trying to catch up. It's a place where the opportunity to make a lot of money exists. It's a higher risk region because of all the political and economic instability. But given the scenario that we're in right now, which is that we're still behind in terms of all the solutions that we know will be built to give people access to health, to education, to financial services, et cetera.

(01:18:36):
But we actually have a lot of money flowing into the region in terms of venture capital. We have the best talent we've ever had because now we've had, I forget how many, but a lot of IPOs that came from Latin America and unicorn companies, people who have worked at those companies or who have worked places like Duolingo are coming back to build now, know what they're doing. And so there's a number of things that have come together that make now a really exciting time to build a startup in Latin America and to scale it. So from an investment perspective, I just think that there's a lot of hot opportunities now in terms of knowing what's a good opportunity versus not. I think the same rules probably apply to those anywhere else, which is most importantly, the entrepreneur. Does this person know what they're talking about?

(01:19:23):
Do they have an unfair advantage in terms of knowing what a problem that exists and knowing how to solve it in a way that others couldn't do? They have access to the best talent in the world, not just in the region that will actually join them and build the best thing possible. And yeah, what's the TAM? And not just what they put on the slide, but what you actually believe the TAM to be. So that's what I would say. I think everyone's looking at FinTech and Latin America right now. It's hot, it's profitable. Money is where the money is, but I'm super excited about what happens with health and education in particular because I think that that has the power to truly transform the region in a massive way.

(01:20:05):
At Latitud, I think I mentioned in addition to FinTech, we tend to invest a lot in B2B SMB platforms that are helping businesses scale and work more effectively because there is a huge need for that and there's an opportunity to build. And I think that that can have an impact on the region. So I think that would be my advice. It's a little broad, but other than that, if not, I would just now sit here and tell you 15 companies that we love at Latitud and I won't.

Lenny (01:20:33):
Well, we can point people to your portfolio page on your website.

Gina Gotthilf (01:20:38):
I would love to highlight our portfolio companies. Maybe I'll just send you a list or something. I don't know.

Lenny (01:20:42):
Perfect. We will figure out a way to share that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Gina, are you ready?

Gina Gotthilf (01:20:50):
I'm ready, Lenny.

Lenny (01:20:52):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Gina Gotthilf (01:20:57):
The one book I recommend because I truly, it really changed the way I think about things. It taught me a lot about a discipline I had never really thought much about, but also because I think it makes me sound smart and it's a really short book, so it's easy to get through is The Design Of Everyday Things. For me, that was the first time that I realized that design wasn't just this sort of cool thing that some people were into and they had to get and it made things beautiful. It was about understanding how everything is designed and how to think about design and usability.

(01:21:28):
So for someone like me who didn't have any experience in product before, I think it could be transformative. And then the second book, it has nothing to do with what we do. I recommend Viktor Frankl's Man's Search For Meaning because at heart I'm a philosopher and I tend to think a lot about life, the meaning of life and what differentiates one life from the next and how to live a good one. And no matter what profession we choose that continues to be important. So those are my recommendations.

Lenny (01:22:01):
What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoy?

Gina Gotthilf (01:22:04):
So first of all, I love Succession, but I don't think we have to go into that. One that was recommended to me by a friend who I very much admire was Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram is How to with John Wilson. It's a really weird TV show that I would've never found if it wasn't for him. But the premise is basically this guy, I think he's a filmmaker and he's awkward and it's cool that he's awkward. It's just his style and he decides to make a TV show about creating to help people who are really worried or scared of doing something and helping them prepare for that moment in their lives.

(01:22:42):
So for example, someone is really scared of telling their friends that they lied about how many college degrees they had or whatever that they said they had a master's degree, but they didn't. And it's now been five years and it's not the debate club, but I forget what it is, but something that requires some sort of intellect and he doesn't want to confront the group. And so he recreates everything that could possibly happen that day in order to make this easier. Or another one about having kids. Someone's really scared about making the decision about whether or not they want to have kids. So it's kind of a documentary, but it's not. It's awkward. It's weird, but it's so good. And then I would say White Lotus, just like so good.

Lenny (01:23:25):
I do that song to my new child often because it's so funny.

Gina Gotthilf (01:23:29):
My husband and I do it at home.

Lenny (01:23:30):
Lot is a recurring,

Gina Gotthilf (01:23:31):
Yeah,

Lenny (01:23:32):
Yeah. I'm not going to do it, but it's a recurring favorite on this podcast. So we had a short drinking game where every time someone said, White Lotus, we drink. So I'm going to have some tea here real quick.

Gina Gotthilf (01:23:41):
Okay. I'm sorry to be predictable, but like I said-

Lenny (01:23:45):
No its great.

Gina Gotthilf (01:23:47):
We humans are a lot more similar than we'd like to think. What's amazing Lenny is just my realization more and more of how much this is true because I like to think of myself as unique much like everybody else. And then I started seeing that all of these really creative decisions I made are what all of the other millennial white girls did. It's just fascinating. Oh, I like whatever, mid-century modern furniture. Oh, you know what? Actually, I'll tell you what movie is my favorite one? Bo Burnham's Inside. I love-

Lenny (01:24:19):
Oh my God,

Gina Gotthilf (01:24:20):
I don't know if that's a movie, but I'm in love with Bo Burnham. My husband knows about this. I know all of the songs and what is it? White Girl's, Instagram? White Woman's Instagram. Such a good song. That's what I'm talking about.

Lenny (01:24:33):
Also, I've been re-listening to How is the best case scenario, Joe Biden,

Gina Gotthilf (01:24:40):
They're going to make me vote for Joe Biden. I was singing this to my parents. They didn't get it.

Lenny (01:24:45):
That's amazing. We'll link to that video, that movie. It's even after COVID, it's incredible. Anyway, I was actually going to say that first show you mentioned, I think it's called The Rehearsal, maybe there's a different title.

Gina Gotthilf (01:24:57):
Oh my gosh, you're right. So he has two shows and one of them is called How To and the other one is called The Rehearsal. And you're right, I am recommending the rehearsal. I have also seen How To, which are shorter episodes where he films in New York and he just goes like How to find a parking spot. And then it takes him on this down a rabbit hole of how cars are made or parking in the city. But it's also very good. But I prefer The Rehearsal.

Lenny (01:25:22):
And Nathan Fielder's the guy behind all this who's incredibly hilarious. He has a new show, actually I think it's on HBO with John Wilson or something that he's producing or it's this other guy. He's going around talking about stuff in New York and I think he's a producer.

Gina Gotthilf (01:25:37):
That's the one I'm talking about. That's How To with John Wilson.

Lenny (01:25:41):
Oh, there we go. So I think he's behind that. Okay, look at us. We're figuring things out.

Gina Gotthilf (01:25:45):
We are figuring things out. So I think he has maybe a new season.

Lenny (01:25:48):
Think season two. I haven't started that one yet. Anyway, here we go. We're going to keep going. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?

Gina Gotthilf (01:25:57):
Why do you want to work here is what I really like to ask because it tells me a lot. Of course, everyone wants a job. People could just be like, because I want a job and it seems like you guys pay well and whatever. I think this is a good next step in my career, but I want to know if this person knows what it is that we do, if they did a minimum level of research and if they connect with our mission because we're going to talk about mission a lot and I don't want them to gloss over it and to make decisions that are short-term thinking that go against our mission because of the reasons I mentioned with Duolingo. So I think that's one, it's not very unique, but I think gives you a lot of information. And then I would say, what are you world-class at and how do you know that you're at that?

(01:26:41):
And the second part is almost more important. What are you world class at? It's okay if someone says, look, I'm working on becoming world class at whatever, and this is why I think I'm great at it or whatever. But the second part is important because it tells me if people actually care about metrics, and I don't care what the metrics are, but just how do you know this to be true? It has to be more than like, "Oh, because my boss loves me," or "Because my mom told me," "because I gave a talk," or whatnot or whatever I want to hear, "I'm proud of having accomplished this." And maybe if you have some numbers to show, that's also really important.

Lenny (01:27:17):
What is a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really like?

Gina Gotthilf (01:27:21):
I have not been trying any products, I would say. So nothing to recommend. I would say though that I am very curious to try these gut health tests that are out there now or microbiome ones. I'm really interested in how little we know about our body and how tech can actually help democratize this information. And going on a tiny rant. I'm also feeling very resentful of doctors right now because we've always lived in a world in which doctors are sort of like these authorities and we must just believe whatever it is that they tell us, and we rely on them for information that is crucial to our survival.

(01:27:58):
But we're now in a world where we can Google things and that's even more scary because you have to know how to filter that information really well and you don't find explanations to things. But doctors don't like you Googling because they say it's scary, but also because they don't like being questioned. I think we're finally coming to a place where a lot of these devices that can give you great information about your body so that you understand your nutrition and very core things about ourselves that we don't today are becoming accessible to a lot of people just to the population. It's still expensive but we're getting there, and I think that will be magical. So I will call out the company Levels by my friend Sam Corcos because I think that what they're doing is awesome.

Lenny (01:28:40):
Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you like to think about? Come back to share with other people.

Gina Gotthilf (01:28:47):
One is "This too shall pass." And I will tell you this one right now is particularly meaningful to me right now because I'm going through a really tough moment because I have long COVID and lost my taste and smell, and it might be long-term. So, but I think it applies to the A/B thing that I was talking about when everything in life is moments except for a couple of diagnoses. And so, "This too shall pass," is something I say to myself a lot. The second one is also not particularly motivational, but I really believe in it, which is, "Fake it till you make it." That's something I've held onto for a long time. And even today, I don't mean lie. I don't mean pretend to be something that you're not, but it's almost like a way to overcome imposter syndrome and by opening rooms for yourself to be who you want to become so that you enable opportunities to become that.

(01:29:39):
And I'm not saying lying, but early in my career, I did fake it until I make it from the point of view of not saying no to things. When companies were saying to me being like, "Hey, can you help us grow without a budget like Tumblr," right? I was 25, 26. I was like, "Yeah, and then go figure it out." And when Duolingo turned to me and said, "Hey, can you be head of growth?" And I didn't know what growth was and I had to Google and find Andrew Chen's blog, I read it and I found out and I just said, "Yes," and then kept going with that. So fake it till you make it as kind of that for me.

(01:30:07):
But even today I have a lot of imposter syndrome, which I actually think is not imposter syndrome, is just acknowledging that I don't know a lot. My team says I have too much self-deprecating humor that actually puts the company down. It puts me down. So fake it till you make it to me means knowing how to stand in front of your team or a reporter or Lenny in a podcast and almost like being that person that you would like to be or being your best self. You could call it whatever you want, but I think it can really help you get out of the little hole that you would put yourself into and limit opportunities for yourself.

Lenny (01:30:44):
Amazing. This question elicits so many interesting insights and stories. I appreciate you sharing all that. Final question. You majored in philosophy, if I'm not mistaken. I'm curious, do you have a favorite philosopher or someone that most influenced the way you think about the world?

Gina Gotthilf (01:31:04):
I use a lot of philosophy in my day-to-day, but it's not because I have deep knowledge, it's because I have light knowledge that I draw on that helps people think I'm smart and relates to ideas. I often talk about Theseus's ship, to me that allegory is one of the most interesting ones because it's about identity and building and whether if the allegory is like the ship-

Lenny (01:31:04):
No, please share.

Gina Gotthilf (01:31:27):
So Theseus is on this journey. I think he leaves Crete and he's going somewhere else and he's on a boat. And then over the course of the trip so many things happen. They've hit so many waves and they have storms that they have to replace planks, and re-sow the sail and by the time they arrive at the next port, nothing on the ship is the same as it was before. They'd replace every single plank. They'd replace all the masts, they've replaced all the sails. And so the question is, is this the same boat that left the dock? And to me, that's a really interesting concept around transformation and what it means to have an identity that exists over time, even when so much of us or so much of a company or so much of a country changes, and what is that core identity?

(01:32:14):
And to me that shapes I think a lot of ideas because it's a cool allegory and it resonates a lot. But yeah, so I would say at this point I embarrassingly have very cursory knowledge of philosophy. I could probably remember a lot of it if I went back to it, but I don't use it in my day-to-day, and I would love to take time off at some point and go study, but I'm also embarrassed to admit that I'm not a person who just finishes work is completely depleted and then wants to bury my face in a philosophy book. I would like to acquire all of this philosophy knowledge, but I want to watch White Lotus. Or if I'm going to force myself to work out, I'll listen to an audio book that makes me feel good about myself, and it's a fiction one.

Lenny (01:33:01):
I think this is actually a great example of exactly what you're talking about, where we change and we are not necessarily the same person we were. That makes sense that you're not obsessed with philosophy having finished that a while ago and now working on something totally different.

Gina Gotthilf (01:33:16):
Yeah, I think I still am because I consider myself to be very existential. I'm an atheist, so I like to find meaning. It's not like it doesn't exist so much for me, and I think about the big questions and I am interested in philosophy. I'm just not interested enough to make time and effort for it in my life right now.

Lenny (01:33:34):
As a hidden gem. At the end of this episode, I'll share, I'm also an atheist and I actually ran a website called atheistspot.com. It was like a Reddit for atheist news. I went to conferences.

Gina Gotthilf (01:33:45):
What does it do? We didn't see God again today, still no God to be found.

Lenny (01:33:53):
Yep. The funniest thing is we had Google AdWords on there and the ads were based on the stories around different religions, and it says all like christianmingle.com, the atheistspot.com. Anyway, Gina, we covered so much ground. What an amazing episode. I learned a ton from you. I'm so excited for people to hear this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Gina Gotthilf (01:34:18):
Yes. Okay. Thanks, Lenny. So people can find me online if you want to see just ridiculous posts. That's where my Instagram is, and my Instagram is impressive because I'm Gina on Instagram. Yes, I am just Gina.

Lenny (01:34:30):
Wow.

Gina Gotthilf (01:34:31):
So that's super impressive. You won't even find it when you look for me because you'll see all these other Gina's, but it's just at Gina. That's me. I do share some professional things as well there too, but I think it's my more entertaining channel. You can find me on LinkedIn. I'm a little more serious on LinkedIn. I have a photo with Obama, which will certainly impress you, so find me. Gina Gotthilf on LinkedIn.

Lenny (01:34:51):
So many stories we haven't covered.

Gina Gotthilf (01:34:52):
I know I'm Gina G on Twitter, and that's probably, you know what? I did a Harry Stebbings podcast and then that got me 600 followers on TikTok, but I've never posted, but maybe at some point. I feel self-conscious, but I think I could be a good TikToker because I think I'm amusing.

Lenny (01:35:08):
Well, you're not going to get followers by saying there's nothing good there. I think if you want people, they'll follow you. You should tell them it's going to be great there.

Gina Gotthilf (01:35:15):
Come see my amazing contact content on TikTok. I will definitely start posting it soon, and you can influence what kind of content will be there because I'm listening to my followers right now, and then how you can be useful. Look, if you know of an amazing founder in Latin America, if you are an amazing founder in Latin America, or if you are in touch with VCs who are interested in this, then definitely tell them about Latitud. You go to latitud.com. Do not misspell Latitud. It doesn't have an E at the end. That's because latitude in Spanish is latitud. However, it's also because we couldn't buy latitude.com with an E, but now that's what it is and it's grown a ton, so get in touch, join the fellowship, join our community. We're particularly useful by the way to us people who are interested in getting plugged into Latin America, because if you get in, you just meet all the top people in one fell swoop, and that helps you make friends relationships, find clients, find your business partners, and understand the ecosystem in a hacky way.

Lenny (01:36:16):
Amazing. Gina, thank you so much for being here. Bye everyone.

Gina Gotthilf (01:36:21):
Goodbye everyone.

Lenny (01:36:24):

# “Dumbest idea I’ve heard” to $100M ARR: Inside the rise of Gamma | Grant Lee (co-founder)

## Transcript

Grant Lee (00:00:00):
I'm in my third pitch in, I get to the very end of the pitch, feeling pretty good about myself. The investor pauses a little bit, and then just says, "That has to be the worst pitch, worst idea I have ever heard. Not only are you trying to go against incumbents, you're going against incumbents that have massive distribution. You are never going to succeed."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
You guys are at over 100 million ARR now, worth over $2 billion. One of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on was influencer marketing.

Grant Lee (00:00:25):
All the initial influencers, I onboarded manually myself. I would jump on a call with each one of them so that they understood what Gamma represented, how to use the product. You want to be able to have them tell you story but in their voice. I think a lot of people think influencer marketing and they'll think these big trendy creators, people that have a million followers. This is the wrong approach. You basically give them a script to read, immediately feels like an ad. That product is not connected really to them in any way. You're much better doing the hard thing, which is hard to scale, finding the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful. People really trust what they say. That ends up becoming this wildfire that can spread really, really fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
Something you talk about it, there is actually a lot of ways to think experimentally, even in the early stages.

Grant Lee (00:01:08):
We would have an idea in the morning, come up with some sort of functional prototype, recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users, but have zero skin in the game, ship fast so people can start playing with it. In the afternoon, we're already running pretty full scale experiment. You start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product. We can also watch them struggle. By the evening or by the next day. We can actually go through all of it together and say, okay, we're going back and we have to fix this. This is not usable and we've done that for everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):
Today my guest is Grant Lee, CEO and co-founder of Gamma. This is a really unique and inspiring, and very tactically useful conversation because Grant is building something that is essentially the dream for most founders. A massive AI startup that's profitable, and has been for a long time, that didn't raise a lot of money for a long time. And as a small team, it's just around 30 people, all who can fit in a small restaurant serving over 50 million users globally.

(00:02:02):
If you're not familiar with Gamma, they're an AI powered presentation and website design tool. They just hit 100 million ARR in just over two years. They're valued at over $2 billion. And unlike a lot of the fast growing AI startups that you hear about, they're growing profitably and sustainably, and in a category that most people did not believe had a huge business opportunity. As you'll hear in the conversation, one investor told Grant, this is the dumbest idea that he has ever heard.

(00:02:29):
In this conversation, Grant shares the very counter-intuitive lessons that he's learned, finding product market fit, how he knew they had product market fit, the specific tactics that helped them grow, including a deep dive into influencer marketing, which blew my mind. Also how they figured out their price, his thoughts on building a GPT wrapper company that is durable, a ton of hiring advice, and so much more. This could honestly have been another two hours of conversation. I suspect we'll do another follow-up conversation next year.

(00:03:29):
My podcasts guest and I love talking about craft and taste and agency and product market fit. You know what we don't love talking? About SOC 2. That's where Vanta comes in.

Grant Lee (00:05:19):
Lenny, it's so great to be here. Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):
I see your face all the time in my LinkedIn feed. I don't know if you know this is a thing. On these JPMorgan Chase ads. I'm so curious if other people see this or if it's just me. Did you know this was a thing?

Grant Lee (00:05:31):
I think it's maybe once a day now I get a text message and just no message. It's just a screenshot or an image of me doing something in San Francisco on one of these ads that we're seeing. And so yeah, kind of embarrassing, but also we're happy customers of JPMorgan Chase, so trying to represent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
Oh my God, I hope you love them. Because it's always you. There's no one else. It's like Grant.

Grant Lee (00:05:54):
I know. Can I talk to you [inaudible 00:05:56] swap somebody out. I mean that'd be great. I'm totally fine with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:59):
Okay, so to get serious, the reason I'm really excited to have you here is, unlike a lot of super fast growing AI startups, you are both growing like crazy, you are growing very profitably. We're going to talk about this. You did not raise a ton of money when you started. You waited a long time to raise a bunch of money. You also built a business in a category that I think most people never imagined there was this big of an opportunity. And you're basically, you've achieved the dream of a lot of founders these days, especially people building AI startups.

(00:06:31):
So my goal with this conversation is essentially do an anthropological study of a really successful AI startup. Talk about how you found product market fit, how you grew, all the lessons you've learned along the journey. And I'm going to break this conversation up kind of along the different milestones of the journey. Before we get into the first piece, is there anything that you think is important for people to hear broadly about the story of Gamma?

Grant Lee (00:06:57):
Yeah. Maybe I'll just start with a quick story if that's okay. And it's really just the founding story. So we started the company back in 2020. This is peak pandemic. And even fundraising was just so different. So all of the fundraising was done over Zoom. You were kind of sitting in these Zoom meetings trying to pitch. Many investors you never met in person. So just a different era. And so for us, we're first time founders. I was actually living in London at the time, and so different time zone. I had to do all of my pitches at night. And I have two little kids, so wait for them to go to bed. 8:00 PM. We had a pretty modest flat, so nothing big. I would basically find this little corner between the kitchenette and the laundry room to kind of set up shot, far enough from the kids so they wouldn't be woken up.

(00:07:45):
In between 8:00 PM and like 2:00 AM, I'm just pitching. Trying my best. I had the fake Zoom background so people didn't know where I was, and just pitching. And so really the first day, I'm in my third pitch in, trying to tell the story of Gamma, obviously just starting to get the hang of the pitch. And I get to the very end of the pitch feeling pretty good about myself. And the investor pauses a little bit, and then just says, "That has to be the worst pitch, worst idea I have ever heard. Not only are you trying to go against incumbents, you're going against incumbents that have massive distribution. You are never going to succeed."

(00:08:23):
And so in my head, I'm already kind of shell shocked and thinking what's my rebuttal? And before I could even respond, he hangs up. And so I'm there sitting there thinking about it. And before I could really get down on myself because I had to prepare for the next pitch, I just internalize this feeling that maybe he's right. Maybe something about what he's saying is actually correct. And so for me, I started thinking about, if we're going to succeed in this category, we're going to really have to think about growth from the very beginning. This category is going to be really, really hard to break into.

(00:08:58):
And so we really kind of made this sort of promise to ourselves, that as we continue to build, growth was going to be critically important. And so my thing to your audience is that I don't come from a growth background. So if I can learn growth, anybody can learn growth. And I think especially in this sort of market, hyper competitive, oftentimes very crowded, it's going to be essential.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:19):
That is such a fun story. Oh my god. How bad must this investor feel at this point. We won't name names. Just to share some stats, I know this is going to be by the time this launches, this will be out, but you guys are at over 100 million ARR now, worth over $2 billion. A business that, again, most people did not think was going to work in this category.

Grant Lee (00:09:41):
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, we feel super proud to have accomplished that. And again, yeah, I'm excited to share some of the growth tactics and things that worked for us because I think hopefully it'll help others kind of on their journey as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:53):
Okay. So let's dive into it. Let's talk about product market fit. Tell us the story of just how you found product market fit, and how you knew you found product market fit.

Grant Lee (00:10:02):
Yeah. I'll start by telling kind of the moment where we thought we maybe had product market fit. And I think a lot of founders ask themselves, do we have it or are we not? And I think there's often a sort of temptation to kind of almost fool yourself into thinking you have it. And so we sort of did our first public beta launch, this is back in August of 2022. We launched on Product Hunt, and felt really good. We had what we felt like was a great launch, ended up winning product of the day, product of the week, product of the month. And it was like, wow, I think we have something here.

(00:10:32):
And then we'd look at signups, and you'd get that initial spike in signups, and then they sort of flatten out. We were still getting new users every day, but it was clear we didn't have strong word of mouth. There wasn't strong organic virality. And so if we just kind of played things out, we knew that the product wasn't going to grow on its own. Something was missing there. We didn't have that strong word of mouth so that the product could just continue growing.

(00:10:55):
And so we really asked ourselves, okay, what do we need to change? And the answer is we need to fundamentally change everything. It for us almost became this sort of bet the company sort of moment. Because at that point we were running low on runway. We knew we needed to make progress and we didn't really know what could be done. And so we got everyone together. At this point, the team was just over 12 people. And we said, okay, it's going to be all hands on deck.

(00:11:22):
We are going to do everything we possibly can to make the first 30 seconds of the product feel magical. The moment you land into the product, it has to be great, and it has to be so great that someone that goes through that onboarding is going to tell all their friends. And if we can get that right, then maybe we have a chance at actually doing something in this space. And so we spent three, four months actually after the product launch, we felt great, but we knew we had to go back to the drawing board.

(00:11:48):
We spent the next three, four months actually revamping the entire onboarding experience. And of course, this is also where AI for us kind of played a big role. We actually rebuilt it so that AI was part of the actual onboarding. So every single new user would experience this sort of magic in the first 30 seconds. And so we relaunched, this is end of March 2023. And all of a sudden, we'd go from a few hundred signups a day to now first day it was like a couple thousand, and then the next day would be like 5,000 signups, and then 10,000 signups a day, and then 20,000 signups a day.

(00:12:21):
And then it just kept going up. And we weren't doing any sort of marketing, no advertising. It was all sort of organic word of mouth virality of the product, people using the product and sharing it with others, where we for the first time really felt this pull. We didn't have to do anything. Product was just growing. And it was just such a distinct difference between that feeling and coming out of the Product Hunt launch where we could have fooled ourselves into thinking we have product market fit. I think the temptation would've been, hey, let's just spend more on ads or spend more on marketing. Because we'll just fuel the top of the funnel and everything else will work itself out.

(00:12:53):
I think that would've been a trap. I think that would've led us down to this path of trying to brute force our way into product market fit. And it would just always be sort of a fleeting sort of destination. We would never actually arrive. And so I think we made the tough call, the right call. It was a sort of bet the company moment, and I think on the other side it just felt so different.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):
Grant, this is exactly what I wanted this conversation to be. I'm so excited. I have so many questions I have to follow up on the stuff you shared before we even get to the rest of the journey. So one is essentially what you're describing is product market fit to you was when organic growth started to really take off, and it was just growing through word of mouth. You weren't doing much because it was so awesome, people were telling their friends about it. Is there anything more there that might be helpful for people to share just to hear about just like, okay, here's what it actually looks like?

Grant Lee (00:13:38):
Yeah, I mean my one piece of advice is when you're early on, your mindset should almost be like you're trying to create a word of mouth machine. If you can get that part right, everything else becomes significantly easier. And if you have any, and I think this applies to both prosumer, B2C, as well as even B2B products, if you have a B2B product, even if you're not telling all of your friends, you should be telling colleagues where that product is relevant. You should probably be telling former coworkers where, hey, you've discovered something like, oh, I wish we had this in our prior lives, and that should even be magical.

(00:14:14):
And then you should see that in all the leads that are coming through or people coming through through your prospects and your existing customers. If you're not seeing a healthy chunk of those leads come through that way, I would go back. I'm like, why? Why is that not happening? Because again, that's the massive tailwind you need where every single thing you do on top of that, all the marketing, all the sales, all the advertising, you're just going to have it becomes way, way easier.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:36):
How much of this was, you described it as a word of mouth machine, how much of this was word of mouth loops and virality features versus just the product itself? One was awesome and two is kind of innately shareable because it's presentations people share with each other.

Grant Lee (00:14:50):
Yeah, totally. I think for us, we do benefit from being in a category where, by nature of it, if you like Gamma, you're sharing it, presenting it to others. So I think for us it's a combination of both. And ideally, you have other ways where word of mouth or organic virality can happen in your product. So by nature of usage, like it's being shared.

(00:15:09):
We basically had an internal mantra that, we go back to the first 30 seconds, we want it to be dead simple for someone to create content, we want to be dead simple for them to share it. And everything we did for that first 30 seconds, or call it the first few minutes, is remove friction so that they can do both of those things. Create and share. And I think other people, when you look at your own product, you think about, okay, what is it about my product and how it gets used? Can you remove friction such that it can actually spread, and even if it's locally within an organization or within a workspace, just be able to enable that as much as you possibly can.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:43):
The other really profound point you're making here is the story of you won product of the day on Product Hunt, which alone is so hard. So many people try to win and don't. Most people don't. I've tried to help companies win, and it's a really hard thing to achieve. And then you won product of the week and product of the month, and still you're like, no, this isn't working. Most people that achieve that are like, no, we got this, and they would not have to bet the company. There wouldn't be a feeling that we have to rethink everything. What is it there that you're just like, no, this isn't going to work, as much as exciting as this is, this isn't it?

Grant Lee (00:16:20):
Yeah, I mean part of being a founder is being as self-aware as you can and be your own worst critic. And so oftentimes you want to have these vanity metrics that feel good to celebrate, and you should celebrate. But you should know when it's a vanity metric versus is this core to our growth engine? If this number goes up, does it mean the product is working? And I think that's where we looked at, okay, it felt good to win those things. We kind of put ourselves at least on the map. But it wasn't good enough to actually have this sort of feeling that we had a core growth engine we could just invest in and get better and better. That wasn't there yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:53):
So essentially it kind of started to just plateau and slow. It wasn't like this rocket ship that took off from that point.

Grant Lee (00:17:00):
Yeah, it was still like we were still getting signups. They were coming through. But you could just tell there wasn't this building momentum. And I think that's where it's always hard to tell. You have to, me and my co-founders, we sat down, we're trying to be honest with ourselves. Okay, is this going to be enough? And it just really felt like it wasn't going to be good.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:17):
The other point here is the power of onboarding, which comes up a bunch on this podcast when you talk about driving retention. So you launched Product Hunt, did great and then started kind of petering out. How much did the product change after things started to work versus onboarding? Just like how important was onboarding? And then just tell us why the first 30 seconds, where'd you come up with that number?

Grant Lee (00:17:41):
Yeah. So for us, the onboarding and the product experience, for us that's intertwined. The analogy I always think about is if you go into a restaurant and maybe the food is good, but when you really think about the user experience, it's like the moment you walk into the door, you get seated, the waitress, waiter comes by, greets you, you can order. And of course the food has to taste good. And then you finally get the bill and you leave. Is that entire experience something that feels delightful? Is it good enough for you to tell your friends about? If someone just came by and dropped the food on your plate on the table, and just left and never came with a bill, I'm like, okay, maybe I'm not going to recommend this to somebody else.

(00:18:18):
And so for us, we thought about, okay, the first moment someone walks through our door, dropping into the product, what is something we can give them? Can we shorten that time to value as much as possible? A lot of this is inspired by Scott Belsky, he talks about that first mile, the first 15 minutes. And I think that's totally right. And I think one approach is you think about new users as you almost have a cynical view of them. You have to think about them being selfish, vain, and lazy, right? They're coming in, they have no desire to learn a new tool.

(00:18:48):
And so what can you give them in that first 30 seconds that earns you the next 30 seconds and then the next 30 seconds? And so for us, we knew that if we can't, people's attention span is even shorter to today than maybe 10 years ago, and so what is it in that first 30 seconds, can we actually show you something and earn the right to keep building that relationship with you? We really thought a lot about that, and certainly that's all we could really afford at the time. We only had 12 people building. It's like we couldn't make an entirely revamp the entire product. We knew that we had to least put all of our energy into one spot, and so we made that coming into the door, come through the door, make that moment feel magical so that we can do a little bit more over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:27):
I love your point about how you could think of it as like, okay, it's onboarding versus the product. The lens of how do we make this incredibly valuable and aha-ish for the first 30 seconds almost informs what the product should be.

Grant Lee (00:19:39):
Yeah. It really helps you pull forward what is the most magical thing about your product. Sometimes founders will think about the five, 10 features. Well, maybe there's only one thing that kind of differentiates you. I try to learn a lot from, we'll get into some of the marketing pieces of this, but even just having this sort of founder led marketing lens of what can I do to help a new user just understand. There's this thing from consumer advertising, which is you throw a consumer one egg, they can probably catch it. You throw them four or five eggs, they're probably going to drop all of them.

(00:20:12):
And oftentimes founders want to talk about the four or five features they have, maybe 10 features. And then the consumer is totally confused, like why do I need this thing? We try to just give them that one egg, that one first experience. We're like, okay, create a slide in seconds. That's the egg. I'm going to throw you this egg. Is that compelling to you? Some people are still going to opt out, but for the people that catch that, you're solving a real problem for them, and then you can continue building on that over time. You've given them enough so that they'll sit around and keep playing with your product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):
That is a hilarious metaphor I've never heard for onboarding time to value, just focus on one egg at a time. Just going even further back, what was the original insight that you had that led to Gamma and what Gamma is today?

Grant Lee (00:20:55):
After the last startup I was at was acquired, I went back into kind of my roots, which is consulting. I was advising early stage startups. And the sort of medium I was using was Google Slides. So I just remember this late night trying to prepare for next day's meeting, trying to format and figure out the right layout, and spending hours just trying to get the sort of look and feel right, rather than the content itself. And for me, that just felt completely backwards. I should be spending 90% of the time on the content, 10% maybe on the design and formatting.

(00:21:25):
And so the question just was what if there's a better way? What if we could reimagine this format from the ground up? Slides have been around for almost 40 years as the default medium of choice for a lot of this. And so we thought about, okay, if we had different building blocks, different primitives, so you're not locked into the fixed 16 by nine slide, what could we offer to users? And so that was really the starting point of all this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):
Hearing this, I could see why investors would be like, I guess so. But slides has been around, PowerPoint has been around 40 years. I get it. I get why people would be... And specifically AI, was that a part of the vision initially, or did AI start to come up, and then wow, great timing,

Grant Lee (00:22:04):
Great timing. It wasn't part of the original vision, although the spirit was there, which is we wanted to make it incredibly fast and effortless for people to create content. So it just so happened that AI was a magical gift that allowed us to do all those things along the same sort of ambition or vision that we had. And so we integrated it core to all the building blocks we were already building well before AI was part of the picture.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:27):
It's such a cool other example. There's just so many examples of ideas that were not possible before are now very possible with AI. And it's a great opportunity for people to come after as these places, categories, people think is an impossible place to build a big business. AI now allows it. Awesome.

(00:22:43):
Speaking of that, let's talk about the growth journey, and how you actually grew from nothing to 100 million ARR in just over two years. I'm thinking we break it up. I know these milestones aren't that clear, but kind of like zero to 100 million ARR, one to 10, 10 to 100, something like that. And let's just see how it goes. How did you get your first set of users? How'd you get your, say, first 100 users? How'd you get to 100 million ARR from zero?

Grant Lee (00:23:10):
Our first 100 looks very different, I'd say. So this was even pre this sort of AI launch we had. The first 100 users for a product like ours, you're trying to convince all your friends to use the product. Anybody that's ever made a slide deck, you're trying to talk to. And I think early on, your friends want to do you a favor, so they're going to try the product. They're also going to lie to you. They're going to tell you how great it is. And then you look at the usage and nobody's coming back.

(00:23:33):
And so I think our first 100 was sort of gradually hard-earned post the product launch, people learning like, okay, this is kind of becoming a little bit more useful. Usage was still pretty episodic, so they weren't coming back every week. And then I do think the moment post the AI launch is where all of a sudden we saw that sort of organic growth happening, people coming back to the product regularly. And so that's where, it wasn't even the first hundred, it was like probably the first 10,000 users all came within a pretty short time period after that initial launch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:02):
Awesome. We're going to talk about monetization pricing later, which is obviously an important part of actual getting to million ARR and 10 million AAR. So what I'm hearing essentially is the Product Hunt launch was a big part of just the first 10,000-ish users. I know there was also a tweet when you relaunched that helped in a big way. Talk about that.

Grant Lee (00:24:24):
Yeah. So when we did our AI launch, we didn't do our AI launch on Product Hunt. We basically said, hey, let's just put it out on Twitter, see if we can get some virality. And honestly, we kind came up with kind of a clickbaity sort of tweet. It was like the most valuable skill in business is about to become obsolete. And so it was intentional in that we wanted to create a little bit of engagement. We knew that having sort of a more provocative in a tweet would allow people to engage with it.

(00:24:54):
And so after a couple of days, all of a sudden it started getting a little bit more viral and a lot more engagement. And we looked and it was basically because Paul Graham had commented and saying something like, "Surely, the thing that the slide deck is describing is more valuable than the slide itself." And obviously it was fun just to see that comment. I think once that comment came through, even more engagement on the post. And then that was really the whole intent of that post was just to be able to have that level of engagement so that people, it would have some level of reach.

(00:25:24):
And so for me, it was almost like my first learning moment, going back to what does founder led marketing even mean? It means how do you actually break through the noise? How do you get a chance to have people even engage with a post like that? Part of that is copywriting, part of that is storytelling. Part of that is just having even the right visuals to share. And so it was for me kind of a moment just understanding, hey, to kind of do this right, you kind of have to do things that maybe you're not super comfortable with, but it makes a difference.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:52):
Such a fun story. So you intentionally set that announcement up to be controversial is what I'm hearing?

Grant Lee (00:25:58):
Totally. Yeah. I'd say provocative. A little spicy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
That is so cool. So essentially you got to 10,000 users through Product Hunt, and then essentially one controversial tweet that ended up baiting Paul Graham to comment.

Grant Lee (00:26:11):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):
Amazing. And it was just a comment. It wasn't even him retweeting it.

Grant Lee (00:26:16):
No, just a comment. And then others would pile on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):
Yeah. It's interesting how much a comment can increase the distribution of a tweet versus them retweeting it or quote tweeting it.

Grant Lee (00:26:26):
Totally. And of course the algorithm change all the time. So part of it was just luck based on when it happened, how it happened, who posted.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:32):
And you use this term founder led marketing, which I love, and I'm already seeing it in action here. This is you thinking about, it's not delegating to someone in marketing, it's not hiring an agency, it's like how do I tell a story that I think will break through the noise based on you building this company, having the insight to build this product. And I guess is there anything more there you think is important for people to hear about the importance of the founder thinking through this stuff?

Grant Lee (00:26:56):
Yeah. I mean, I think most people today are probably familiar with founder-led sales, which is still very, very important. I think before you hire your first salesperson or AE, it's great for the founder to understand what it takes. And they're going to craft the right narrative, the right story. At my previous role, I was the COO at a startup where I was doing a lot of, I wasn't founder, but I was early. And so I was helping the founders go through this, and really helping go into meetings with a client or a prospect and saying, "Hey, this is why our product is interesting."

(00:27:26):
And I think today there's so many AI startups that are much more either B2C or prosumer. And so you're not necessarily talking to individual prospects, but the idea that you can be really in control of the narrative on the marketing side is really, really important. And I think I'll describe a few things where, over time, I think that skill set just really, really helps you.

(00:27:48):
One is you have a chance to be a creator yourself these days. I think a lot of founders are trying to be more active on social media. And I think if you can kind of overcome the initial cringe factor of seeing yourself and postings like, oh, this doesn't feel authentic, if you can overcome that initial feeling, you start investing into like, okay, how do I become a better copywriter? How do I articulate something that is clear, not just clever? I think there's that saying where obviously if you can have that clarity, that's super important. And most people will try to get super creative with their copywriting, but that's not usually the right way to break through and communicate something. So how do you improve your own copywriting?

(00:28:27):
And then that allows you to actually have a higher bar when you start working with other marketers, or in this case for us, working with influencers. If you're working with influencers and creators, and you can totally empathize with how they approach that work, and you know what a good hook looks like or you know how to structure a good post, you can only do that if you've gone through it a little bit yourself and you know how hard it is. And I think too many founders will then just say, they'll write something that just feels so much like an ad, and then they'll give it to a creator to help amplify. And then that just never works. And so I do think part of founder-led marketing is going through this yourself.

Grant Lee (00:29:00):
And so I do think part of founder-led marketing is going through this yourself, using your own platform. In the beginning it's probably going to be super small. But as you get bigger, you have a platform to ... You have a voice and people listen. And you're going to get better and better at your own storytelling. I think these are all skills you should invest in as early as possible, because you know you're going to have to get better and better. It's like practice, you got to practice over and over.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:21):
I definitely want to pull on this thread more because you tweeting the lessons you learned building Gamma is what led to this conversation. I was reading, I'm like, " Okay, he's sharing a bunch of stuff, but there's so much more I want to hear." And we're going to talk through this and go in a lot more depth than what you've shared on Twitter. But I love that that's example of that working, having this conversation.

(00:29:41):
So let me ask a couple of questions here. One is just how do you find time as a founder or CEO of a very fast growing crazy startup? We have so much to do. How do you just allocate the time to do this? And then any just key lessons you've learned about doing this well, beyond what you've already shared for people that want to try to start sharing things on LinkedIn and Twitter?

Grant Lee (00:30:00):
My advice is definitely just to try to start small. Don't let it become so intimidating that you just don't get started. For me, it was like just having a notepad or a Google Doc around in the beginning where I would just constantly jot down, okay, this is something I learned or something I observed or something that worked well, something that was unintuitive but worked, and just start creating a log of that. And then once I had enough of those, and I'd spend basically every week, I'd block off a few hours to go a little bit deeper. I'd take a lot of those bullet points and try to say, "Is there enough here to turn this into maybe a post or something that can be shared broadly?" And in the beginning I didn't have enough. It was all sort of scattered thoughts. But over time you start accumulating some interesting themes. And then I would start stress testing some of that.

(00:30:45):
So I would tell my teammates like, "Hey, this is something interesting. Do you find this interesting?" And if there were enough like, "Oh yeah, I would not have expected that", or, "That's not something I've ever heard before," then I'd actually start crafting the initial post. And then you actually just put it out there. I think what I've learned is, even for LinkedIn versus Twitter, the audiences want different things. And so you almost have to then have different tones of voices or even nuggets or sharing. For me, I invested much more in LinkedIn early on just because it felt a little bit more natural for me. And then over time I said, "Okay, well I'm going to start packaging certain content for Twitter that's actually different than what I would post on LinkedIn." Sometimes on Twitter you get even more tactical or even more into the weeds. And so I found that to be helpful.

(00:31:27):
But honestly, I'm still learning. And so every time you post, you go back, after a couple of weeks you go and say, "Okay, what things are actually being engaged with? Are things actually creating ..." Ideally you're creating enough value where people are either bookmarking it, sharing it, retweeting it, these things that are signals for there's something valuable there. And then you just go back and you start collecting your own sort of, these are my all-star posts, these are the ones that I've actually broken through. And then you go back and try to understand, okay, what about that post do I think was actually useful? Was it the actual content? Was it the structure of the content? Was it some sort of contrarian advice? And you start thematically bunching that together such that as you're brainstorming every week, you just have a good sort of body of work to work off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:10):
This is so interesting and valuable. So let me mirror back a few of the lessons that I heard here that I think is easy for people to miss. So one is just what to share. What I heard here, and I completely agree with this, and this is what I try to do, is pay attention to things you've learned, things that you find interesting, things that are unintuitive to you. Just have a doc and just put these there. And every time you learn something, find something interesting, just add it to the doc. Or yeah, I haven't heard before is a good one too.

(00:32:39):
So it's essentially just like if you find it interesting, people on social media will also find it interesting. And one approach is just share it as it's happening, which is what I try to do. Just like, "Oh hey, just learned this thing with with clock code. Check it out." Or save it up for a big long post. The other interesting, I've never heard this before, of post different things to LinkedIn and Twitter. I just copy and paste the same thing. I love that you do something different for the two platforms.

Grant Lee (00:33:05):
I think we all kind of have intuition that there's just different audiences, right? And so if you know that kind of fundamentally, then the question is how do you package up the story the right way so that the audience is ready to receive it? And I think this can differ by the type of creator or the founder, whoever's posting it, and of course the actual content itself. And so for me, I'm still tweaking, but I do find that just copy and pasting from one to the other doesn't usually work. You almost need to be in the right mindset of, okay, what do I think will be more engaging on Twitter? And then what do I think will be more engaging on LinkedIn? And then test a bunch, see what actually works. Go back and iterate a little bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):
So if you had one bullet point tip for what works on Twitter versus LinkedIn, you shared maybe more tactical on Twitter, is there anything more there you can share?

Grant Lee (00:33:56):
Yeah, that's what I've found is tactical, oftentimes more contrarian on Twitter. And also I would say technical too. People really like to know, again, going back to getting into the weeds, is this something I feel like I could replicate? And I'm not going to give you ... There's no credibility if you just give a blanket statement or something that feels generic. I really need to know, if you could show me the metrics, even better. I feel like that ...

(00:34:22):
Versus LinkedIn, it's oftentimes more even just either more aspirational or aspirational or a topic or a theme that just feels relevant at that point in time. And you can just kind of make more of a broader statement. It doesn't need to be as tactical. It's more like inspirational, is like, "Oh, okay, now I need to go and learn a little bit more about pricing and packaging," for instance. And that could be the sort of spark that somebody needs. And you don't need to spell it completely out. Part of it's also that on LinkedIn you can't really do threads. And so doing a super long form post isn't as practical. Maybe that changes in the future, where maybe the tactical pieces, that element might actually change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):
And last piece is you said you just block off time. Is there a specific time of the week you do this? How do you actually ... Because everyone's like, "Oh sure, I'll block off time. And then, I don't know, okay, but I actually got to do all this other stuff so I'm not going to use it this time or maybe next week."

Grant Lee (00:35:12):
For me, it's usually two times of the day, very first thing in the morning and last thing at night. And partly it's because of kids. It's almost like I need time where there's just zero distraction and there's no noise in the house, and so I can actually think. And then I think in the mornings it's about where are you finding inspiration, what are topics you're energized by? And then I think at night it's about reflection. What are the things you actually went through that day? You can almost pull up your calendar and be like, "Okay, I talked to X, Y and Z people. And was there anything from those conversations that might be relevant?" That's where I write some of those things. It's more of a recap of actually what happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:50):
And what helps me to not feel like this is some cringey self-promo egotistical stuff is just it's useful stuff that I've learned that ends up being helpful to people. And people in the comments are always just like, "Oh, that is really cool and useful. Thank you." It's not like self-promotion-

Grant Lee (00:35:51):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:05):
... it's not just like, "Look how amazing I am. Check out my amazing products." Like, "Here's a thing I learned. You might find it useful."

Grant Lee (00:36:11):
That's exactly right. I think one way of thinking about it, with founder-led sales, it's always about exchange of value, right? You want to be able to give the customer this feeling that they're getting an amazing product. In exchange they're going to pay you money for it. I think with founder-led marketing, it's almost this mindset of you want to give people a ton of content, maybe it's a value in the content, so you're sharing something, maybe some secret tactic or you're giving them something where inherently there's value in it, and in exchange you sort of get goodwill back. You're not necessarily getting money back, you get goodwill. They're going to follow you, they're going to engage with your post, they're going to tell others about it. And then over time you can exchange maybe some of that goodwill for actually talking about my product and announcing it and they're going to help amplify the news. And I think that's magic, where you kind of bank the goodwill for a long period of time by providing just a ton of value with no expectation of anything immediately in return.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:06):
The book I always point people to when they're struggling with this sort of thing and like, "Okay, I did this and no one cared, didn't do any good," is there's a book by Scott Pressfield, I think is his name, called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit, which is exactly what is right. Nobody wants to read it. The bar for people to care is very high. There's so much stuff to read and process. And so this book gives you a really good lens of just like, okay, the bar is very high and nobody wants to read your shit, so you have to try really hard to make it really good.

Grant Lee (00:37:38):
Great reminder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):
We'll link to that in the show notes. Okay, let's come back to the growth of Gamma. So we've talked about how you got your first tens of thousands of users, essentially product hunts, rethinking, onboarding, making it really magical, and then this very controversial tweet that Paul Graham commented, created some buzz. Let's talk about the next phase and maybe, I don't know, tell us kind of the ARR at that point through 100 million. Just broadly, what should we know?

Grant Lee (00:38:07):
So when we got to about 10 million in ARR, I think there was this feeling for me, which was we knew we needed ways to help just continue to amplify and spread the word about Gamma. I think it was already working in terms of the organic virality was there, and so we did feel like it was time to start amplifying some of this. And I think the main blocker of my mind that I started feeling was that our initial brand was holding us back. And I think a lot of people will discount whether or not a rebrand is valuable. And I think sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

(00:38:39):
For us, there's a few different things we looked at. So one, our initial brand was almost more of a placeholder brand because we created it the moment we incorporated the company, which was again late 2020, beginning of 2021, where we needed something so that as we built, we could at least share it with people. We could put up a landing page and just feel like, okay, there's something here. But we didn't invest a whole lot into it. And so it was pretty limited in sort of what I call the DNA of the brand. There wasn't that many ... The art direction was very limited in scope. There wasn't much when it came to voice and tone.

(00:39:12):
And so it was something that we knew was good enough to start, but it wasn't scalable. And when I think about something that could be scalable, it's almost like you can take the ingredients of a brand and replicate it a ton, this DNA is something where you can imagine creating tons of content around and all feeling pretty cohesive. And I think that needs to be done by design. You're really being thoughtful about every single element. Like what is the art direction you want to go with? What is the voice and tone? Such that as you're creating thousands of pieces of copy, it all feels pretty cohesive.

(00:39:45):
And so we went back to the drawing board and we spent many months rethinking what would be the brand, what is this vision that we have longer term? Our creative director internally partner with Smith & Diction, an amazing agency that has helped folks like Perplexity also do their rebrand or their initial brand. And we [inaudible 00:40:05] many months just really trying to craft what we think is the core DNA of the brand, and doing so in a way that we could replicate it as much as possible.

(00:40:15):
Replication piece of it comes into play, because as you start scaling you're going to have to create a ton of content, your own content on social media, ads for performance marketing, assets for influencers to be able to use and showcase in their content. And so you're going from tiny pieces of content to all of a sudden every week we're testing thousands of pieces of creative. And you cannot do that if you don't feel confident that as you're replicating, you have that sort of cohesive feel. So for us that we realized it was going to be necessary and it's why we invested so much. It ended up being way more expensive, way more time consuming than I would've imagined. But I think coming on the other side of it being the right investment, feeling that that was the right time to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):
I love how many things you did that feel like this will not work out. Building a startup within the presentation space, doing a whole rebrand in the middle of scaling, also just reworking the entire product after you launched and just rethinking the whole thing. All these things and everyone's always like, "No, this is not how we win." And interestingly, worked out for you guys.

(00:41:19):
I want to come back to the brand stuff, but one of the most interesting ways you guys grew early on was influencer marketing, which a lot of people hear about and talk about. I haven't heard much of how to actually do this and what actually works. Talk about that as a broad growth lever for you guys. And then I want to get into just what tools did you use, who actually was really helpful there, thing like that. So yeah, just give us the big picture.

Grant Lee (00:41:44):
Yeah. I think a lot of founders assume that with influencer marketing it's almost like turnkey. You set aside a budget, you find some creators, you figure out the right campaign or the right moment of time to do it and it's all done, you're ready to go. And I think the reality is, going back to this founder-led marketing mindset is like, well, you're going to set yourself up for success if you actually are super involved in that entire process. So for us, what this meant was all the initial influencers I onboarded manually myself. I would jump on a call with each one of them so that they understood what Gamma represented, how to use the product. You want to be able to have them tell your story but in their voice, right? And they can't do that if you're not willing to put in that investment.

(00:42:32):
And so we would spend a lot of time going through ... It wasn't my job to tell them how to pitch Gamma, but it was my job to make sure that they understood what Gamma was as a product. And so we'd spend a lot of time, like me just walking through the product, them asking questions, us just kind of brainstorming what could the hooks be, and me just giving them some initial feedback and saying, "Oh yeah, this one, I love that. I figure it's going to work great for your audience." But not trying to be super prescriptive. And working with a ton of micro influencers, people that don't have massive followings but are committed to ... Going back to giving value to your audience. They're committed to giving value to their audiences. They want to be able to showcase tools that actually they would use or they are using. And how do you do that in an authentic way? You can't really fake that. You really need to spend the time doing that.

(00:43:16):
And just like you would onboard a customer, you onboard an influencer the same way. You want them to be an extension of your team. And I think they can feel whether or not you're willing to put in the work. And if you're not, then they're just going to treat it like any other project, ship it and be done with it. If you invest in that relationship, guess what? They'll be back to actually post about you again. And you're all of a sudden having this sort of this relationship that actually you can build over time. I think that's really where the magic is. Too many people discount that initial piece.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:47):
This is awesome. To be clear, influencer marketing, essentially a person with a following on say TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever, gets paid in some way to promote your product. That's the simple way to understand influencer marketing, yeah?

Grant Lee (00:44:00):
Yes, that's definitely the simple way. And I'd say there's definitely different levels. I think a lot of people think influencer marketing and they'll think these big trendy creators, people that have a million followers for instance. And the idea is that, okay, we're going to carve out a really big budget, we're going to choose five or six that we feel like are really the tastemakers in the space and put all of our money into just having them talk about our product. And I think usually this is kind of the wrong approach. Because many of them, they do have massive audiences. And for you, you basically give them a script to read and it immediately feels like an ad. That product is not connected really to them in any way. It's just something that they're ... For this week they happen to be working with you and then they move on with their life. And it never feels organic or authentic and you wasted a ton of money doing so.

(00:44:55):
I think you're much better doing the hard thing, which is hard to scale, but it's finding the thousands of micro influencers that have an audience where your product maybe is actually useful. And for instance, for us early on it'd be educators, people that for them, part of their job is creating slides every day because they need to engage their students. And so for them, having a tool that actually saved them a ton of time was something they love talking about. And if you can find some of these pockets, we call them echo chambers, where if you find a pocket like educators, teachers love telling other teachers about products they love using. During summer break, they all come together and talk about, "Okay, what are the things that are going to actually improve my job next school season?" And obviously during this AI wave, a lot of those have been, "Okay, what are the AI tools that just save me a ton of time?"

(00:45:43):
And so if you can start actually tapping into these pockets of echo chambers, that's even better. It doesn't have to be this flashy, well-known influencer. It's actually just this person that has an audience where people really trust what they say. And that's amazing. That ends up becoming this sort of wildfire that can spread really, really fast.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:03):
And what's the dollar amount these folks get? It's like a few hundred bucks, a few thousand bucks, something like that?

Grant Lee (00:46:07):
Yeah, few hundred to low thousands, low single digit thousands.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:11):
How do you find these folks? Is there tools that you use? Is it just like a bunch of manual searching and looking?

Grant Lee (00:46:17):
Yeah, in the very beginning it was all manual, a lot of cold outreach. And then we ended up finding a couple of different things. One is a platform, a YC company called 1stCollab. That has been amazing. They basically do all of the automated outbound for you. Plus you can help them actually create profiles or personas of different creators, so for instance educators being one, and then they'll go out and actually, based on that profile, find all the right creators for you. So they've been amazing, really great to work with.

(00:46:46):
And then we've also found small agencies to also help kind of augment that. I look for agencies that are super young and hungry. These are people that they're native to social media and so they really understand it. And they can really be able to bring in creators that are great to work with. And I think part of it is if you find creators that are great to work with, everything else becomes easy. So we've had a few, one is AKG Media, actually out in the UK, and they've been fantastic to work with as well. So you kind of find a few different things, either agencies or platforms that can help you actually scale this thing up.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):
And when they post, they're generally transparent about this is a paid promotion, right?

Grant Lee (00:47:23):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:27):
They're not just pretending, "I found this tool and I love it"? Cool.

Grant Lee (00:47:31):
Yeah, exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:32):
Okay. And so how much impact did this lever of influencer marketing have on your growth, say from 10 to 100? Is this the biggest lever of growth other than just word-of-mouth, people continue to share it?

Grant Lee (00:47:44):
Yeah, so word-of-mouth has definitely been the biggest. So we look at all new subscriber growth, over 50% of this is word-of-mouth. It's either people searching direct, coming direct, entering Gamma.op, or going through search and typing in Gamma, like a branded keyword search, where they're looking for Gamma, they've heard about Gamma. But I think for us, social media and influencers specifically has always been an amplifier. So every time we invest in influencer marketing, we actually see word-of-mouth increase even more. And it's always like you can just see it. Basically anytime you spend a little bit of money, you start seeing people come through influencer, the word-of-mouth factor actually will get another 1.5 additional users on top of that, which has been really interesting to see.

(00:48:29):
And I think part of this is just recognizing that ... And I think we kind of understand it, but with influencer marketing, why it's so effective, we all know Dunbar's number, which is have this number of 150 people that you call kind of your network. And your network you trust more than the average stranger down the street. If they tell you something, they recommend something, there is a sort of halo effect, you learn to trust them. A lot of these influencers, the reason why they share so much about their lives is because they want to be in your network. They want you to feel super close. And once you feel super close, you trust them to actually share things that are going to be useful.

(00:49:05):
And so when they recommend a tool, there is a sort of halo effect, where it doesn't feel like it's coming from a stranger, it feels like it's coming from a friend. And that's where every time we've spent money there you actually see this amplifications, like, "Okay, that's kind of interesting." You wouldn't necessarily expect that. But for us it's been this sort of amplifier from the very beginning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:24):
This is so fun to hear about. I've not heard this level of detail on how influencer marketing works and how to make it work. A few more questions here. So you said there's maybe a few thousand people you ended up working with, roughly, influencers?

Grant Lee (00:49:35):
Over the course of a year. It wasn't all in the same time. Basically in the beginning you do ... In the very, very beginning we had a small budget. It was like 20 creators a month. And then you start increasing that to like 50, then 100. We're definitely not fully scaled at this point, but I could easily see a point where you're working with many, many creators every single month. And that gives you a chance to actually test a variety of, again, content hooks, ways to talk about the product, value props.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:03):
Amazing. And you said the key here is you spend time with every one of these creators, influencers early on to help make sure they understand what you're doing and get excited about it. It isn't just like a thing you outsource.

Grant Lee (00:50:16):
I think there's a lot of value there. It's again hard to quantify. And most founders probably feel like they're too busy to allocate that time. But I think it was a good investment. Because going back to you want them to feel like an extension of your team. They're not going to feel like an extension of your team if, one, they've never met you, and two, you've never even told them really how the product works. They're forced to go to your website to figure it all out. Those are going to be not a whole lot of love that they're feeling from the outset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:47):
So what I'm hearing is quality over quantity, especially when you're getting started. And then there's this other piece of niche which I think is very counterintuitive. Instead of going to large influencers with a huge audience, it's good with folks that are small. What's like a audience size roughly that you think is ideal for this, or what niche just means?

Grant Lee (00:51:05):
Honestly, I don't think there's a minimum, because even with platforms like TikTok, they oftentimes are giving you credit for a brand new account. They want to help amplify that new account, because obviously if they're thinking from a creator perspective, if that new creator feels like, "Oh, coming to TikTok is a massive win for me," they're going to be more invested in it. And so there really isn't a minimum. A lot of these platforms are trying to shift to kind of the same thing, where they really reward new creators on the platform. And so you could have a small audience, it doesn't really matter. You could have 10,000 followers, that's also good. I think as long as the content feels, again, engaging, authentic to the people you're talking to I think it has a really good chance of actually taking off.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):
That's such a good point with TikTok, where it's not follower related, if it's useful and people find it clickable or whatever, likable, viewable, the algorithm will spread it to a lot of people. Such a good point.

Grant Lee (00:51:59):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:00):
Okay, there's a couple more points you made in the tweet that I want to make sure we highlight. So one is you made this point that 90% of your reach in influencer marketing comes from less than 10% of people. Is there anything there that you think is important for people to hear?

Grant Lee (00:52:11):
Yeah, I mean this just goes back to it's hard to know where that 10% is going to come from. So you kind of just have to cast a super wide net. You can sort of, I think try to, again, trick yourself into thinking you're great at picking creators or you're great at telling them how to post about your stuff. But the reality is, even for me, I could never guess. I kind of had some idea, but I just had to make sure that I was meeting enough creators broadly such that when you meet enough, they're all posting, there's some pocket that end up just taking off. And I was not a good predictor of that. I was not smart enough to actually know which ones would take off. I just knew that we had to play the sort of numbers game to make it work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:49):
So one of your tips here is people fail often in this because they start too small or their budget's a little too small. You recommend 10,000 to 20,000 a month over six months and just trying this. It sounds like you're doing like 20 to 30 creators a month. Is that the right framework for how to just start this thing and explore?

Grant Lee (00:53:07):
Yeah, totally. And I'd say it's not just that the budget's too small, it would be that they put all their eggs in one basket. So you can also easily blow that 20 K on just one bigger influencer and then be like, "Oh, that didn't work, so I'm going to try it again. That didn't work. Okay, I give up." And I think rather than doing that, you should be like, "Okay, that 20 K, I could actually probably work with 40 different influencers and see what actually works." And across the 40, I'm going to try to find a variety of personas, a variety of use cases, spend a lot of time with them, and then actually see what's working, what's not.

(00:53:39):
And then next month take those learnings and double down. If educators are working, go with educators. If consultants are working, go with consultants, find more consultants, there's going to be more there. I think that's where the putting all your eggs in one basket is just probably the surest way to fail, because you're going to miss a ton and it's going to take you way too long to learn and you're going to come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
I feel like this whole podcast conversation could be just about this one lever. So much I want to keep talking about, but there's more questions here because this is so useful and interesting. You had this line in your tweet about how reality is not an accident and that this approach is how you figure out what actually works. And then once you do that, then you start leading into that messaging. Talk about that.

Grant Lee (00:54:20):
This goes back to obviously if you're testing a bunch, you'll finally find that sort of post or set of posts that actually go viral. Going back to just the fundamentals, like make it easy for your influencers to be able to tell your story in their voice. One thing we did, we open sourced basically our entire brand. We have Brand.gamma.app, which is everything about our brand, our voice and tone, our art direction, what we use in mid-journey to create the sort of art direction that we have so that a creator can do the same, right? And they can actually just copy all of that so that they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time they're trying to post about Gamma. They have all of that.

(00:54:56):
And I think going back to this notion of just make it dead simple for them, remove friction. They already have enough on their plate to have to figure out. Don't make it any harder than it is. And if you remove friction, then it's like, oh, you get into this rhythm of adding creators is easy, having them post is easy, reviewing what's working, what's not is easy. And if you're able to do that relentlessly over many, many months, then all of a sudden hitting the sort of viral post is easy because you're going to have enough bats there where some are actually going to pop off. But you only can get there after you've done all the hard work before that to remove friction from the process. And feeling like it's almost like a well-oiled machine at that point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):
Is there a platform you find most helpful for the stuff you guys are doing? Is it like TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, something else?

Grant Lee (00:55:45):
Yeah, I mean this is one where for us we cast a pretty wide net too. But it's very clear, LinkedIn, the conversion rates are just substantially higher. They're 4X, maybe 5X higher than other platforms. And I think a lot of people are probably still sleeping on LinkedIn, frankly. And so it's one where some of the influencers there or creators there can be a little bit more costly. But if you can eventually be more targeted knowing that, hey, this type of creator is pretty impactful for our product, then working with them, it's just like, "Oh, that's great." The conversion rates are just so strong and it really feels like we're just getting started there.

(00:56:22):
So if in the beginning you're not sure, it's always helpful to cast a pretty wide net. And then similar to just the influencer strategy, like test and iterate, you'll figure out ... Many of these things will follow a power law. So it's like one or two channels are going to be the most important for you. For instance, Twitter for us hasn't been that impactful. And I think for tools like Notion, they've been really, really impactful. You're not going to really know, and so just test and then double down on the ones that really move the needle for your product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:48):
I think that many people listening now are like, "Wait, LinkedIn posts are sponsored sometimes? I didn't know that." How do you know if it's a sponsored post? Is it like a #sponsored or something like that? How do they communicate this?

Grant Lee (00:56:57):
Usually they'll say they're a partner or yeah, basically it is sponsored in some form, or they'll #ad or something along those lines. So that's probably the way you'll see it the most.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:12):
Cool. By the way, I don't do this sort of stuff. Have you ever seen me on LinkedIn? I'm not doing any paid stuff. It's just so people know. And I don't plan to do that.

This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear. But a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done. Miro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Guests of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:00):
... Often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots, into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes. You don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's Canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/Lenny. That's M-I-R-O .com/Lenny. Let's come back to this brand point. So, one of your big lessons is invest in brand before you go heavy into hit paid ads and performance marketing. I imagine you do some ads at this point on Facebook and Google and things like that.

Grant Lee (00:58:42):
Yeah, we run ads performance marketing. I think there's this stigma that brand marketing and performance marketing are sort of at odds with each other. I very much follow the sort of thought that brand marketing is performance marketing. Everything is some form of performance marketing. It just might not be as attributable, so the ability to actually map back to every single dollar spent is a little bit harder, but it doesn't mean that it's not impactful.

(00:59:12):
And I think as a company scales, you have to invest in both, and ideally they work really, really well together. The more you invest in brand marketing, it strengthens your performance marketing. This goes back to having enough creative to even test. If you're too limited in scope and you don't have a brand, you feel like you can actually amplify your handicapping, your ability to actually have a good performance marketing program.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:32):
I love that heuristic of how do you know if you are under invested in brand is if you're limited in the number of ideas you can try in performance marketing.

Grant Lee (00:59:32):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:43):
Is your design system just... Is everyone having to redesign things from scratch and come up with all these frameworks every time they run an ad?

Grant Lee (00:59:52):
Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Basically you kind of have a feeling for, "If I were to scale this up to a thousand pieces of creative, would it still feel cohesive or is it kind of all over the place?" And if it feels like it's all over the place, then you kind of have to go back to the drawing board.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):
You said when you talked about the rebrand, that it took a lot longer than you expected, that it was more expensive than you expected. That's the fear, I think, everyone has when they hear this like, "Oh, I don't have time for a rebrand." I also imagine, because your product is so visual, that it makes more sense to invest there and to spend the time and money.

(01:00:23):
For the typical founder, do you have any just, I don't know, thoughts of just like, "Here's when it makes sense. Here's a sign you really need to invest here heavily." Versus, "It'll probably be all right."

Grant Lee (01:00:32):
Yeah. I mean, I do think it's probably more geared toward anything that's a little bit more prosumer or consumer because so much of your product, you're trying to create this feeling for a user, what are they experiencing. And the experience happens way before they even drop into your product. It might be they see an ad or they see a billboard or they see something. It's like, "Okay, that piqued my interest a little bit."

(01:00:56):
And then you need some sort of symmetric messaging in that they see there's some symmetry in that, they see the ad, then they drop into the product or they land on your website, it feels cohesive and it feels like, "Okay, this is interesting. I'm going to go all the way through to sign up and then maybe actually start using the product."

(01:01:12):
That's a little bit different when it's a B2B product or where there isn't as much reliance on that initial moment. They might just hear about it through a colleague and then sign up for it and then go through a huge procurement process and then it's like, "Okay, maybe it matters, but probably not so much as for a product where the brand can have so many different touch points."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):
I want to talk about some broader things that have worked to help you grow, but before we do that, I just want to visualize the pie chart of how Gamma grows. Say, post-10 million ARR. If I have it correctly in my head, it's over 50% just word of mouth, organic, people are sharing it, doing presentations for each other, "Oh, it's Gamma. Just go check it out, sign up." Then it feels like the second-biggest bucket is influencer marketing, social stuff. And then is the third performance/paid marketing?

Grant Lee (01:02:03):
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:04):
Cool. On that last piece, is there anything else there for people that are starting to explore performance marketing, essentially Facebook Ads, Google Ads, all these other platforms, is there anything else that you think might be helpful for people to hear or learn just to get started down this road?

Grant Lee (01:02:19):
I would just have two recommendations. One, going back to my initial piece of advice, which is don't invest until you have word of mouth. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you'll solve other problems by just starting to ramp up a performance marketing program. Just get the word of mouthpiece first, so that you're coming into this program with some tailwinds and then start ramping it up.

(01:02:40):
The second piece is: set some constraints. You don't want your product to be at a point where more than 50% of your acquisitions are coming through paid acquisition. I think if that is happening, your core growth engine is broken. And it feeds right back to point number one, which is if your core growth engine is broken, you just have this leaky bucket. You're trying to spend so much money building top of the funnel, people are not making it all the way through. Something else should be fixed before you really try to dial it up. And it doesn't mean you don't spend a little bit of money, but just don't dial it up until you feel like your core growth engine is actually working.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):
When you said the first point about wait until you have word of mouth before investing in performance marketing, is that essentially a large chunk of your growth should be coming from word of mouth, direct, organic?

Grant Lee (01:03:29):
Yeah, yeah. And for us, even at scale, again going back to more than 50% of new signups still come through word of mouth. That, for us, is a sign like, "Okay, if something is still working, people are using the product, telling other people, then you want that feeling before you really start dialing anything else up."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):
Is there a percentage that you think is helpful for people to think about just... Is it 25% or more something like that or just word of mouth for you to feel like, "Okay, we actually have organic growth as a major growth engine"?

Grant Lee (01:03:55):
Yeah, I think this comes back to maybe just how maybe aggressive you want to be. I think just rough heuristic is the more, the better. If it's over 50%, I think that's great. If it's approaching that, good. And just going back to, don't fool yourself into thinking just ads is going to be the way you grow. Because you can do that, but everything else becomes harder and harder. 

(01:04:16):
If you rely on paid acquisition to be the main growth engine, you should be prepared for things like CAC, like customer acquisition costs, to keep going up. The more you're trying to reach a new audience, it gets more and more expensive. So, don't assume it's going to be flat, and then all of a sudden you're running on this treadmill that's actually running faster and faster. And so that's where it's easy to get hooked on that early on when you're just investing a small amount of money, and then it's almost impossible to get off that treadmill when you're too far into it. So, anticipate that and give yourself a better chance at actually being able to sustain that growth long-term.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):
Important advice. Okay. There's a couple more elements you've shared that were key to Gamma's growth. One is sharing prototypes with users before you ship. What does that look like? What does that mean? Why is that so powerful?

Grant Lee (01:05:05):
Yeah. I mean, this for us was a huge unlock. Going back to early days, when you're just trying to get your product into anybody's hands, you're getting to your friends trying to use it, and again, they're going to lie to you, tell you how great it is, and then never come back to using the product. 

(01:05:19):
I think what you want to be able to do, the ideal situation is, you recruit a bunch of people that are legitimately good prospective users or customers of your product, but have zero skin in the game. They do not care at all whether or not your product succeeds. They're just in it to test it. And for us, it was people that have made slide decks or make slide decks regularly, let's drop them into Gamma, give them very little context. We just tell you, "Hey, this is an alternative to PowerPoint. Go ahead and try it."

(01:05:48):
And then as you're going through the onboarding flow and testing the product, just tell us everything that's going on in your head, describe what you're seeing, tell us what you're trying to do. We'll give you maybe a few different tasks like, "Oh, create a piece of content." And when you watch them do that and also hear what they're saying, you just immediately feel the pain. 

(01:06:10):
All the places they're struggling and all the places are so confused by what they're seeing and you sort of then can internalize that pain and say, "Okay, we're going back and we have to fix this. This is not usable." We, oftentimes, are dog-fooding everything. And so you can get to the point where you're so familiar with your own product, everything feels kind of easy and you know where things are, but when you start actually hearing other people describe their usage of the product, that's a gift.

(01:06:36):
You're all of a sudden you're like, "Okay, now I know where to actually spend the time." People aren't even getting to the third screen. They're stuck on the first screen because they can't even find the button that we think is so dead obvious, and so let's go back and actually re-engineer, re-architect that piece of it.

(01:06:50):
And we've done that for everything: landing pages, onboarding experience, new feature launches, export, sharing, every single piece of that such that we can actually see where things are working or not. And then every time, we'll learn something that's kind of painful, but obvious that we need to fix and we go back and fix it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:08):
How do you scale this sort of thing? How do you run every new big idea, new feature change by people? Do you have a closed beta group, a decent platform? How do you actually do this?

Grant Lee (01:07:19):
There's a couple of great platforms. Voicepanel, which is also YC company, full disclosure, angel investor, and then there's also platforms like UserTesting, that really help you source and find these people that fit again, that persona or profile you're looking for. So, in our case, people that are in a specific job function or create decks regularly, and so you can use those platforms to really scale up these programs pretty fast.

(01:07:45):
And then once your team knows how to use those platforms... We would have an idea in the morning and in the afternoon, we're already running a pretty full scale experiment or a research study, and by the evening or by the next day, we can actually go through all of it together. So, it's pretty fast once you have it set up. It's more about how do you get the program onboarded the right way. 

(01:08:06):
I think the other sort of mechanism we did early on was once we had some repeat users, we created sort of a program for our power users. We called it the Gammaster Program, which is we put them into a separate Slack workspace, and that was a place for us to share very, very early prototypes like wireframes, sometimes they were functional prototypes, and get them to get some initial feedback as well. This definitely helps with more later stage or features or things that aren't going to be necessarily important as part of onboarding, but once you understand Gamma, like, "Oh, how do you share it?" 

(01:08:41):
For instance, this was a great way to start testing some of that because they already understand Gamma, but now you're adding that new functionality. And then we can also watch them struggle and hear how they're struggling with the product. And so that has been a great way just to have a separate Slack workspace. Anytime we're thinking about something, they're the first to hear about it. Give us some early indication if we're on the right track or not.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):
I love this workflow that you shared of you have an idea in the morning, you built a prototype. Do you built it with AI prototyping tools like Cursor, Lovable, something like that?

Grant Lee (01:09:11):
Yep. That or it could be... Yeah, I mean we're lucky a lot of our designers also know how to code, so even before the recent tools, come up with some sort of functional prototype and then be able to ship that so people can start playing with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:24):
Yeah. So, you have an idea in the morning, you build a prototype using various tools. By the end of the day, you are getting feedback from real people using one of these platforms, Voicepanel or UserTesting, and just that loop saves you, I imagine, potentially months of just building the thing nobody wants and shipping it, launching it, and then just failing. 

Grant Lee (01:09:45):
Totally. Yeah. I think this is even more probably helpful for certainly a lot of folks that are starting to do much with vibe-coded apps. Yeah, that's great. You've lowered the amount of time to get something out there. Now, prove that it's useful to some set of users, and this should be again, every day, every week, you should be able to go through a ton of these, and then build on the things that seem to be working. 

(01:10:08):
I feel like that's almost like a way to speed run a lot of that early... you're in the idea maze, you think you have something that could kind of work. How do you actually break through so that people are actually finding value in what you're building?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:21):
Yeah, I love it because so many people hear this idea of just run your stuff by users before you do the user research. It sounds so hard and heavy lift-y, and the way you're describing it is very automated, very quick to do. You don't have to go think about finding random people in a coffee shop. It's just like these platforms exist where you could go plug in your thing, get feedback by the end of the day.

Grant Lee (01:10:44):
Totally. Yeah, and that helps you just move way faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):
Is there a feature that you were super excited about that you built and ran through this and just like, "Okay, that was a huge failure"?

Grant Lee (01:10:54):
I don't think any of the ones where we... We always try to chunk it down. So, none of the things we're testing earlier on are these massive features. They're always an inception or a starting point of, "This could be something interesting."

(01:11:07):
And then we take that initial learning and actually then build the product around it. It's never like, "Oh, we spent four months working on this thing. Let's see if anybody actually wants it." It's almost like we always start super early. And then a bunch of ideas die right away, but they're still pretty small ideas. 

(01:11:20):
And then the ones that kind of pass the initial test, you start building towards something that could be, hopefully, more game-changing or much more value-add. And by the time you're actually shipping, you've gone through 10 different layers of actually testing and iteration before it actually sees the light of day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:34):
What's really interesting about you and the way your company operates, you guys are ex-Optimizely people, so you're very versed in experimentation. A lot of people talk about A/B testing experimentation as something that doesn't make sense for a startup because the scale is so low. What I'm hearing here, and I know this is something you talk about, is just there is actually a lot of ways to think experimentally, even in the early stages. Is there something more there you think is important for people to hear?

Grant Lee (01:12:01):
Yeah. I really think it's more of... The mindset you go into to almost any problem or opportunity is the saying of, "Strong opinions weakly held." I think it's totally fine to have some of these assumptions or hypotheses going into a lot of these things, but you should always know that there's a way to start trying to validate some of this.

(01:12:20):
As a founder, you're always trying to build conviction, and so you build conviction by not having it all live in your head, but getting it out there and start testing this with users, prospect customers, and starting to see what are the things that actually feel right. And sometimes you have enough data to be statistically significant. Sometimes it's more of a, "Hey, we at least were able to gut check this a little bit and get some qualitative feedback." I think that's still valuable. It shouldn't be this sort of all or nothing like, "It has to be static for it to be useful." I don't think that's true. 

(01:12:49):
In fact, I'll just share the very early story of when we first started Gamma, we knew we wanted to help change the way people communicate, and we actually had two different ideas we were parallel pathing kind of at the same time. Of course we had presentations, reimagining how people were creating presentations, and we also actually had this separate idea, which we called The Lobby, which is a virtual office. This is a place where this is, again, peak pandemic, much more hybrid work, much more virtual work. And so this was a place where everybody on the team, whether you're in the same office or not, could gather, collaborate to feel pretty magical. 

(01:13:26):
And we worked on both for six months. We worked on both the virtual office and the presentation product for six months. We would dog-food both. So, oftentimes we'd be in the virtual office, presenting the presentation tool and kind of use both. And after six months, we came to this conclusion that we wanted to go all in on the presentation tool. And the reason was, when we looked at the virtual office tool, we were sort of always competing against what we thought was something we'd never be able to surpass, which is in real life experience, actually being able to work shoulder to shoulder with your colleagues and having this environment where you really feel like you're building together. 

(01:14:05):
Virtual office could get pretty good, but we would never beat that. And so we were almost limited in our own imagination about how good could this product be versus the presentation product. We ended up with a million more ideas we thought we could actually introduce that could be better than how you work in PowerPoint today. We were just so energized by it. 

(01:14:25):
And so for us, that was this sort of A/B test of testing these two things that we invested equal amount of time into, and coming out at the other end realizing that, one, was going to be the product we were pour all of our blood, sweat and tears into making it great because we saw the potential in it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:43):
I didn't know that about you guys, that you explored that other idea. There's so many startups that did that during COVID times, and like, "Okay, this is the future. We're all going to be remote, and let's work remotely in virtual offices." There's a startup and I'm a tiny investor in, Lindy, that is now a big AI agent company, and they did the same thing. I imagine that was their whole first concept. It was just these little avatars. It was like a little game where you walk around, go to little virtual meeting rooms. 

Grant Lee (01:15:07):
Yeah, it was a fun product to work on, but yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:12):
Yeah, it's interesting how we just reverted back to the mean of just like, "Yeah, people are in offices again. That was a fun experience." Although things have changed. Just to highlight this point you made that I think is really powerful, I haven't heard it described this way before, just the power of testing prototypes very, very, very early, using these platforms that make it super easy.

(01:15:34):
We always hear, "Okay, you have a mock, you have a prototype. Yeah, testing with users always feels like this heavy thing. You got to have a user research team, go do interviews, do one-on-ones." What you're describing is something... I don't know why everyone's not doing this. With AI tools, it's so easy now. Have an idea, build the prototype, test it with, I don't know, is it like dozens of people? How many people actually run through a prototype on average?

Grant Lee (01:15:58):
20.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):
20 people. So, 20 people look at this thing, give you a bunch of feedback, you realize this was very dumb, or, "Here's the nugget that we want to lean into." And instead of building a thing, instead of doing all these user research sessions, things like that. Super cool. 

(01:16:12):
Okay. Is there any other big lesson or lever that has helped you grow to today's 100 million ARR, and $2 billion company? We talked about influencer marketing, we talked about testing prototypes, investing in brand and a little bit of paid growth. Anything else?

Grant Lee (01:16:33):
Certainly for us, the ability to adapt and move fast in this environment. I attribute a lot of what we've been able to accomplish to a few things. One is we do have a small team and a lean team, one that's able to move really fast. I think that means, by default, we have to look for a lot of levers where a small team can do a lot of different things. 

(01:16:54):
So, we can talk, one, obviously about how do you construct a team like ours and what I think has worked. And then two, going back to experimentation being this sort of thing where for us it's been a huge unlock because it allows you to not only test things and iterate a ton, it allows you to build much more efficiently. And so we've been in a startup where we've had great unit economics from the very beginning. We run profitably, we have really strong margins. 

(01:17:22):
I don't think that would be possible if experimentation wasn't core infrastructure to us because the temptation would be you just throw the most expensive model at every job and assume that's going to work. And the reality is that never is the case. And so for us to be able to actually test across 20 different models in production today, always trying to align the kind of value we're delivering to our customers with our ability to actually scale this operation, that's been in the background. 

(01:17:48):
And not always things that are easily quantifiable or things that you're sharing broadly, but it is core to our DNA. And again, going back to a team that came from Optimizely, probably not surprising, but I do think that's been part of our ability to actually execute at this level.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):
I love that the product is so beautiful and such a good experience. It's such a good example of experimentation and being really obsessed with running experiments, A/B tests. Data can create really beautiful products and experiences that aren't just feeling like some kind of micro-optimized flow.

Grant Lee (01:18:19):
Totally. Yeah. And just going back to one part of the team, part of that plays a huge role, which is you want to build a product where people talk about taste and brand and all these things, what they emote. I'm not going to throw in whether or not, yes or no, but I do think it makes a difference. And for us, at some point, more than a quarter of a team or about a quarter of our team was product designers. I think that's an unintuitive level of investment, or at least that's not common. You don't see many startups at our stage or early stage where a quarter of the team's product designers. 

(01:18:55):
And I think that was an important investment for us because when you think about with AI companies, so many companies are trying to invent new surface areas or new user experiences, and that's not possible if you're not really getting the foundation right, really thinking deeply about user problems and how can you solve them in a novel way. And so for us, we made that investment in the very beginning, even if it was counter to what other startups would do, because we actually felt like it was the right thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):
Okay. I definitely want to spend more time on hiring. Before we get to that, you've touched on this kind of concept that you guys are, what many described, a GPT wrapper company. You essentially sit on top of other models, do some cool stuff, charge for that. There's historically, and there's been a big shift here, historically, there's this sense that, "Okay, you're just this thin layer on top of the model. How is there any sort of motor leverage or long-term business model here when it's just the model that is doing the thing and charging you guys to do all this AI work?"

(01:19:57):
It feels like people have started to realize maybe that is the only place money will be made because the models are just so hard to compete with, and that's not a place you can build a business anymore. Talk about just what you've learned about this concept of being a GPT wrapper, and what people may not be understanding about the business opportunity there.

Grant Lee (01:20:15):
When you think about maybe just literally only being a wrapper on one model or one provider, yeah, maybe there's only limited amount of utility or value add. But then when you start thinking about, "Okay, I'm going to go really deep into this one workflow, and it's not just one model." It's maybe 20 plus models powering all different parts of the product, and then you're thinking about the orchestration that's required and you're thinking about, obviously if you're experimenting constantly being able to test across the newest models versus models that have been around that are cheaper, you're doing a lot to really... Your job is to, again, align value, maximize the value you're delivering to the end user in a way that's sustainable for you as a business. And so there's a lot more to that. 

(01:21:00):
And so for us, we've always been passionate about being very close to our customers, our users. Who, for them, their job to be done is visual communication, visual storytelling. And the default tool today is going into a PowerPoint or Google Slides where the amount of effort to create something... We've all been there late at night trying to format a deck, trying to find the right layout, all this manual and tedious work. 

(01:21:24):
Well, what if you could abstract all that away and give them something that feels a little bit more delightful, a little bit easier, much more effortless? What would that earn you in terms of a customer that wants to come back to your product? And so that's everything that we focus on is you need to go deep into the workflow, be empathetic to the user and their job that you're trying to solve, and of course, apply the best technology possible so that you're delivering on that promise of a product experience that's way better than the status quo. 

(01:21:52):
And I think if you can be laser-focused on, it doesn't matter if you're a wrapper or not, what is the technology you're doing and applying, that makes a real difference? So, that's the ultimate goal.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):
This is a really cool framework for how to think about what it takes to build a successful wrapper company that is... I don't know, I'll keep using that term. I don't know if it's [inaudible 01:22:09], but just some ideas don't work. These model companies are launching their own products here and there.

(01:22:16):
So, what I love about what you're describing here is almost like a heuristic that'll tell you if there's an opportunity/how to be successful as a GPT "wrapper company." I'm putting in air quotes. It sounded like maybe there's three here. But talk about just if you think about the bullet points of what you need to do to build a successful business on top of existing models.

Grant Lee (01:22:37):
I mean, I think the most important thing is before we even talk about the technology, so we're skipping to the part where you're trying to apply the most interesting models or technology to solve some problem. Start with solving the problem you actually care about. 

(01:22:53):
I think it's very tempting right now to chase shiny objects, like a founder might be able to gain some initial traction by literally being that GPT wrapper and solving any sort of problem. And you start to see some traction and then you just go with that. But before you do that, you should think about, "Is this a problem I can invest five to 10 years into actually solving? Do I care deeply enough about it?"

(01:23:13):
Because if you can't, you're never going to go... actually think about overcoming the variety of different hurdles, whether it's other startups or other incumbent tools that are trying to start doing the same thing. 

(01:23:24):
And so for us, we go back to... We've started this company because we really care about helping change the way people communicate their ideas. We really feel like this idea of visual communication, visual storytelling matters. It helps elevate everybody and it gives people much more opportunity to do the things that in the past if you weren't great at making slides, your ideas might've died, and someone else that was able to actually articulate their ideas better ended up winning the deal or winning the favor of their manager or their boss. 

(01:23:53):
And so we felt like that was the wrong, that didn't feel right, and so could we help democratize visual storytelling, visual communication? That was sort of our north star. And then you go back into thinking, "Okay, every step of the way, what are the tools and technology I can apply to help solve that and actually move the average person closer to that long-term vision of ours?"

(01:24:14):
And of course, AI has been, again, this gift where yes, you can apply that to solving this job. You can also apply that AI to many different jobs. Figure out what is the problem you care deeply enough to go deep, because going back to this sort of idea, you need to own the sort of end-to-end workflow. A customer needs to have... You want your product to live in their brain somewhere where when they think about, "Hey, I have to create a presentation." They come to you as the default tool.

(01:24:40):
And the moment they start creating it to the moment they ship it and send it to their boss, that end-to-end experience needs to feel magical, needs to feel great. And I don't think you can really do that unless it's actually a workflow you either know deeply yourself or you care deeply to actually help solve for somebody else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):
So, some of the elements I'm hearing here is, one, is just like actually really care about solving this problem, not come from, "Oh wow, this cool thing happened and it worked. Wow, maybe I could sell this thing to people." Because you may end up having to work on this thing for 10, 20 years.

Grant Lee (01:25:11):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:12):
Two is: understand the problem really, really deeply and have real empathy for the people trying to solve this problem. You have this problem creating presentations at your previous job, so you understood it, and I imagine you understand even more deeply now that you worked on this. Essentially, care really deeply, go really deep on the problem, have real empathy for the people facing this problem, and then there's this actually be able to solve this problem using the technology out there.

(01:25:39):
And you made this point about how you guys use 20 different models to do what you do. Talk a little bit more about that just because people may think, "Oh, okay, I could just go to ChatGPT or Claude and it'll create an awesome presentation for me." Why does it take 20 different models? Why is that such a big part of the success here?

Grant Lee (01:25:55):
Yeah, so going back to the workflow, you're trying to go and break down every step of the creation process for a user. So, the moment of the initial idea to maybe creating an outline of what you want to present or articulate to creating the first draft. What do we show you there to editing the content? 

(01:26:14):
Like, "Okay, I have a first draft, but it's only 60% of the way there. How do I get to 100% of the way there?" Those are all things that might require different models. The initial outline might be better served by something that's purposed-built for actually creating the best outline, the best narrative, the best story arc, versus one where you're actually going back and saying... Gamma, our agent can actually go and review your entire deck and say, "Actually, if I were to add suggestions, I would say, 'You may want to change the visual layout on these set of cards, and you may want to actually change the imagery or the visuals for these cards to match everything else.'"

(01:26:50):
These are things that, again, every model might be better served for different things. And so knowing how that actually breaks down into the end user, sitting down, working on the product, working on their presentation, how do you help them? I think you can only do that by understanding-

Grant Lee (01:27:00):
Their presentation, how do you help them? I think you can only do that by understanding that workflow and then breaking that down into finding the right tool for the right job.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:08):
That is super interesting. Essentially there's like, here's the things that AI has to do for us. I don't know, imagining some kind of a storyboard and then it's figure out the model and level of model and prompt for that model to achieve each of these steps as best as possible.

Grant Lee (01:27:23):
Totally. Yeah, and it applies to even on the visual side, finding the right image. I think certain models are great at photorealistic output versus others want more of the artistic vibe or something that feels more abstract. And so again, you can choose the right model for the right job. It doesn't mean that you'll never use other models, it's just like as you're going through that workflow, the content might dictate what's the best use case. So in that particular use case and so you're always trying to map to that, what is the end user trying to accomplish in that certain moment?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:55):
Which models are you finding most useful in the work? I don't know, is there anything surprising about, "Oh wow, this model's actually really good at this and this is really bad at that."

Grant Lee (01:28:04):
Yeah, I think surprising or not surprising, the leaderboard is constantly changing and so this is where you almost, you have to have the mindset that you can be adaptable. We're just getting to the point where there's going to be more personalization too, is going back to a consultant's going to have different needs than an educator. Educator's trying to engage their students. They may want to have language or visuals are more animated and that makes sense. Consultant can't get away with that. They may need something that is much more structured or information dense. And so again, how do we actually be the same tool that can serve both of those needs? I think that's where it becomes interesting and it's almost like there isn't necessarily even a "best model". It's like what's the right model for that particular user? That's actually a much harder problem to solve and we're just starting to try to embrace some of that now.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:50):
Is there one that's just like, "Oh, that's actually really cool." For something that we didn't expect?

Grant Lee (01:28:54):
Early on, things like creating the outline, Perplexity was actually great. Not one that people talk about as often, but creating the outline and doing web search and actually integrating some of those elements together for us was pretty powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:07):
Okay, there's two more things I want to talk about. One is pricing. How you guys figured out your approach to pricing. You guys started monetizing really early and that feels like such an important piece to AI startups because you're spending real money on an inference and other things. And then I want to talk about hiring. So in terms of pricing, when did you decide it was time to really start charging and then how did you pick your approach to pricing your actual price?

Grant Lee (01:29:32):
So we kind of stumbled into having to do pricing and packaging. I mentioned our big AI launch in March 2023. This was pre-revenue, so we wanted just to get, we focused all of our effort on the first 30 seconds, literally all hands on deck, just trying to get that right. And we spent zero time on actually monetization. So we had a credit system. All new users get 400 credits. Once they burn through those credits, there was actually nothing more you could do with AI. It kind of just got cut off. And so Intercom for us was just blowing up with people saying, "How do I purchase more credits? I want to keep using this thing." In a very fair question. So basically all of April we ended up having to do a quick sort of pricing and packaging exercise. We did a couple of different things.

(01:30:18):
We did run a form of Van Westendorp, which is just understanding-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:22):
Classic.

Grant Lee (01:30:23):
...what is the overall willingness to pay. And so we did use that. We did kind of integrate some forms of conjoint analysis, which is just trying to understand what are the features or things that people actually value in your product. And so we'd survey a lot of our early users and ended up coming to a price point that was, in the beginning we only had one plan type. It was roughly like 20 bucks a month. Part of this was also just realizing we almost didn't need to overthink it too much because this is when the initial wave of AI companies and startups were coming out and products are coming out and you almost end up becoming anchored by, what does ChatGPT charge? Because everyone becomes familiar with that price point. And so we ask ourselves how complicated do we want to make it?

(01:31:05):
We always default to remove friction, make it as easy as possible for a user to understand. And so we end up coming up with a similar price point and ship that as the V1, basically end of May 2023. And for us, we wanted to see a couple of things like, okay, we have the initial price point. Is it economical for us at that price point? Are we actually making money? And we'd monitor there for that for many, many months realizing that yes, actually at that price point we could still generate pretty good margins and that would allow us to reinvest that profit back into growing the business.

(01:31:37):
Continue to add obviously head count, but then also investing even more into inference costs, whatever we wanted to do to experiment broadly with AI. And so we've always had that pricing and packaging. Does it not only need to be easy to understand for a user, obviously you have to have strong conversion rates, but it should be something where you feel like you could build an enduring durable business off of. And if it's not right, then you can always go back and try to tweak things, but it's something you should be monitoring as early as possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:06):
What's interesting, we have the head of ChatGPT on the podcast and he shared the way they picked ChatGPT's prices is the Van Westendorp survey that they ran in Google Forms.

Grant Lee (01:32:14):
Totally. Yeah, I listened to that one. Yeah, it was a great one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:17):
Oh, what a, that survey man, what a, and not only just that survey being the slick, I'm imagining that XKCD comic with the open source little, I don't know, block holding up the entire world, like this one little piece of code. That's like the survey, just behind everything. But it's interesting how that one decision just created this ripple effect on all AI startups, 20 bucks a month. Of course that's what everyone's doing.

Grant Lee (01:32:43):
Totally. Who knows what would happen if they chose a different number, but here we are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:46):
Everyone would be so much more rich if it's just like 25 bucks. Someone. Imagine the GDP of growth-

Grant Lee (01:32:52):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:54):
...from that. Oh man. Okay. And then the way, so was Van Westendorp helped you pick a price point and then you said this conjoint analysis, we actually have a guest post that I think describes how to do this well and if not we'll find, appoint people to how to actually approach this. You started charging, so was post product [inaudible 01:33:11] launch, you launch with no paid features. People were just like, "I want to pay, I want to keep using this." You're like, "Okay, I guess we've got to start charging."

Grant Lee (01:33:18):
That's right. Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:20):
Is there anything, looking back, I guess just you wish you'd known when you were approaching pricing for folks that are doing this now like, "Oh, we should have done this differently or should have thought about this."

Grant Lee (01:33:28):
Yeah, I mean that one's hard. I think you never want to obviously just throw something together without giving it much thought, but for us with limited resources, we focused on the only thing we thought mattered, which was getting some initial users and having that organic growth. And I think there's maybe two checkpoints of thinking about whether or not you feel like you have product market fit. I think one checkpoint is organic growth. The second is are people willing to pay for the product? And I think if you pass both those, you feel like you've, at least within some pocket of the market you have some PMF. So I think those are both important questions to ask depending on your resources. Ideally you can do kind of both and experiment a little bit along at the same time. And then by the time you actually have paying users, you sort of check some of those boxes for yourself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):
By the way, I love that your launch pricing. You're like, "Okay, let's figure out if we're actually making money or not." It's not obvious with AI companies. [inaudible 01:34:24]

Grant Lee (01:34:24):
Well, we also didn't have a choice because at that point runway was also low. So if we weren't making money, well we would actually be in a tough spot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:31):
That's such a good point that you did not have a huge amount of money sitting around to spend on the way a lot of companies in AI do, just, "We'll deal with it and we'll figure out how to make money later."

Grant Lee (01:34:40):
Totally. Within a couple of months we had hit a million in ARR and became profitable. And so those were both two exciting milestones for a company that months prior were heads down figuring out how we even survive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:53):
What a story. I'm so excited to be telling this story. Okay, final topic I want to talk about is hiring. You have some really hot takes on hiring, clearly it's worked out for you guys. What are some things you've learned about hiring well, what is your approach to hiring?

Grant Lee (01:35:08):
So we had this mantra internally, I mean even before the sort of AI launch for us, which was "Hire painfully slowly." And I think the temptation is once things start working, you just start, [inaudible 01:35:23] scaling this thing and start adding more and more headcount. And for us that always, I don't know, that didn't feel right. We wanted to build the team very thoughtfully, be lean, but also be a team that every individual feels like they have high amount of impact that they have on a daily basis. And so for us that was from sort of the very beginning. And so even as we've scaled up, I think we've been super efficient by nature of just being a very lean team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
So I think a lot of people hear this advice of "Stay lean, be efficient." You have some even more concrete pieces of advice here of just what that looks like. You have a huge, I don't know, philosophy of just huge leverage per person. You focus a lot on revenue per employee. Talk about that.

Grant Lee (01:36:03):
So obviously we look at things like revenue per employee, but we never let that be the sort of North Star. It's not something that dictates our strategy per se. Same thing with profitability. I think by being efficient, that ends up becoming a side effect of yeah, we are profitable and growing. But I think for us more is like we care a ton about adding the right team members. So it's easy. You can almost sort of shoot yourself in the foot as a founder by just setting the wrong goals. If your goal is to double in headcount and add a hundred people to the company, then that becomes the goal. The goal is no longer to add the best people. It's no longer to maintain a high quality bar. The goal is to hit a hundred people and that's everything everyone's focused on. So then guess what?

(01:36:44):
If that's the goal, then the thing that ends up dropping is, okay, maybe we will settle for employees that are good enough and we're going to make sure we get to that hundred because a hundred is going to help us get to the next phase of growth. And then the next phase of growth. And I think we've tried to resist that temptation, which is we want everybody that comes through the door and joins our team to really be the type of person that represents Gamma. Our first 10 to 12 employees, we spent so much time really getting the DNA right. I think Brian Chesky talks about this. Your goal is you get that first 10 and you want to be able to then replicate the next 10 and then replicate the next 10, but that 10 needs to be all super cohesive. You need to have the same shared values, same principles, same ambition, same vision, and if you don't, then what are you even replicating?

(01:37:32):
Right? At that point you're just adding headcount and you can easily just be adding headcount because we're chasing the next shiny startup to join. And so for us, we really focused on that first 10. That allows us to really have this sort of community of teammates that basically want to stick around. A lot of founders think about not wanting to have a leaky bucket on the product side, but the same thing applies on the team side. If you have a leaky bucket, people are just constantly leaving, revolving door. That's a huge amount of cost. The continuity cost is massive and it's really hard to quantify.

(01:38:08):
And I mentioned our first 10 employees, all 10 of them are still here today, five years later. And so that sort of continuity, it means that you have this tribal knowledge that sticks with you. It means that people can continue building and having that sort of cohesive feeling. So I think that's one piece that's just like, it's hard to quantify, but I do think, new startups I would advise just to really be thoughtful about that, get that to a point where you really feel confident that as you're adding the next 10 and next hundred, you're actually replicating the same DNA and not actually just adding a bunch of random people to the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:38:39):
One of your very specific piece of advice is hire generalists versus someone that's just really deep in one thing, why is that so important? What does that look like?

Grant Lee (01:38:47):
This very much feels like the age of the generalist or the rise of the generalist right now. When we think about of a team that can be really flat, you still want people that can be very spiky in certain areas. So for instance, obviously a product designer that knows how to code, that's great. It allows you to actually span across many different domains. And again, an organization that's super flat, when you're wearing a lot of different hats, that means every individual, if you're a generalist, you can wear by default a lot of different hats. And that's helped us just maintain this idea that the work, the opportunity in front of us can easily expand. Each person plays a huge role. They don't need to wait and ask for permission. They can go after and pick up a piece of work because it's there and they can at least get it started even if they're not the one that always sees it through.

(01:39:34):
And so for us, I do think this rise of the generalist is going to be important. You can always augment that by working with contractors or agencies that are hyper-specialized in certain areas. And this is where, for instance, going back to influencer marketing, you might work with an agency rather than kind of scale up your own influencer marketing team. You work with a hyper-specialized team there. But my marketing team is all generalists. Our head of marketing more recently launched this cool drone show in San Francisco. We have 4,000 people in San Francisco. The mayor came by, she created that entire project and managed that entire project end to end herself while also managing the entire marketing team. And so it's like this idea that a generalist is able to play all these different roles, can still be super high impact. For us, it also goes hand in hand with, I mentioned sort of this other role, which is the player coach. Traditional management layer is like a manager manages a ton of people and that's kind of their core focus.

(01:40:33):
All of our people leaders are player coaches in that they still do the end work themselves and they can mentor and coach those around them. This analogy came from, or this mindset came from, it's something I borrowed from just the sports world in general because there's a lot of sports that just move incredibly fast. Like football for instance, it moves really, really fast. And so you might have a coach that's calling into play, but the quarterback can actually make a last-minute adjustment based on what he's seeing the defense do. And so you want a player that is on the field that can adapt as needed and that way the coach doesn't have to call every single thing in. He's just kind of giving you the general intent of what you want to run as the play and then the quarterback can still make the adjustments.

(01:41:13):
And so all of our people leaders, our management layer is all folks that actually can make those adjustments. If they're seeing something that doesn't feel right on a daily or weekly basis, they're adjusting priorities for that team and they're still doing the work themselves too. They're so close to it that they understand what is the relative prioritization at all times. So both of those I think have been, when I think about founders, they oftentimes think about innovation in the sense, we're going to innovate on products or innovate on technology. I think every founder today has a chance to innovate on org design, and that starts by just thinking about what is the type of company we want to build today? What does it mean? And when it comes to the management later, what type of sort of leaders do we hire? What does it mean when it comes to hiring specific roles and specific functions? All of that is a chance for you to be very thoughtful and build a company that you're excited to be at for hopefully many, many years to come.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:07):
So what I'm hearing here is manager, there's no pure managers at Gamma and your plan is to not have people that are just managing the ideas. Everyone, even a manager is doing their own IC work.

Grant Lee (01:42:18):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:42:19):
And then the other piece of advice here is just generalists. People that can do a lot of stuff, and I hear this a lot on this podcast just like everyone is, there's no more just like you're a designer, that's all you're going to do. Designers need to build stuff, market stuff, write some PRDs probably.

Grant Lee (01:42:34):
Just one thing to add is that's where we are at today. I think being adaptable means that certain things may evolve and change and how the player coach model evolves and maybe in certain functions or as the team scales, that's not going to be practical everywhere. I think the reality is you just have to know and be willing to adopt different frameworks over time and being honest with yourself with what's working, what's not. I think we're constantly trying to learn and evolve ourselves. I think we're doing it in a way that we don't believe it really has been done before, and so we have to kind of pave our own path over time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:10):
I love that. Giving yourself an out when the time comes when you need to just hire managers.

Grant Lee (01:43:14):
A year later when you invite me back, I'll say, "Yeah, this is what we learned."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:43:16):
Yeah, that makes sense. That's probably going to happen. It's like people are like, "We don't need product managers." [inaudible 01:43:22] "I see. Maybe we do." Yeah, that makes sense. One last piece I want to talk about is you have this really cool quote that you shared on Twitter. " When you find someone exceptional, bet big on them." This is a big part of your philosophy is just bet big on the people that are doing super well. Just talk about what that looks like and why that's so important.

Grant Lee (01:43:40):
Yeah, I mean this starts top of the funnel, which is you meet candidates, you decide who you actually hire. And so if you don't start with a high bar there, going back to what is the goal? The goal is to hit a hiring target versus maintaining a super high quality hiring bar. Those are different goals and I don't think we've ever kind of dropped our bar. And so then you bring somebody in that you think is exceptional, that brings something unique to the table, that can be a good teammate. When they're thriving, you just give them more and more resources. I think what you realize, another sports analogy is when you're on an A team for instance, or a team that you feel like is exceptional, A players want actually more playing time. You never see a star player that says "I actually want less playing time."

(01:44:26):
They want more time on the field, they want to actually go after the hardest problems. They want to be able to feel like they're making a huge impact. And so if you have fewer exceptional teammates where you can just throw almost anything at them and they'll figure it out, that feels for you as a team, just feels great because then they get what they find rewarding, which is the ability to go after hard hairy problems and to be able to come out through the other end feeling like they've accomplished something. And I think that for us has always been something that goes beyond just almost everything else. We give people a chance to really thrive in this environment and we try to nurture that as much as humanly possible every step of the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:45:04):
Is there anything else around hiring that you think is really important or a big lesson you've learned or lesson you share that we haven't talked about yet?

Grant Lee (01:45:12):
I mean, there's some of these intangibles, which is for the founding team, does this feel like this could be your life's work? When you're pitching a potential candidate, does this feel like something where you're actually committed? The unfortunate side of a lot of what's happening in the AI world broadly is I think you're coming to learn which founders are sort of missionaries versus mercenaries. And many that were just chasing maybe just a big outcome, or something shiny, or something to feel good about themselves, they'll go off and then the company, I guess doesn't live on or maybe has to find a different way, a different path.

(01:45:47):
And so something I admire is you look at some of the founders, obviously before this sort of AI era, folks like Dylan or Melanie, Figma, Canva, Ivan at Notion, they've been doing this for over a decade now. They had many chances to just leave and sunset off into doing whatever they wanted to do, but they care so much about the mission, they've stuck it through. And I think when you're talking to candidates, candidates can kind of tell, is this something the founders even care about? And I think you're going to have a better chance of attracting true missionaries, people that want to build with you for the long haul, if it's authentic and it's something you actually care about.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:46:24):
Oh man, I keep saying this. I feel like we could have at least five more hours of stuff to talk about. That'll be good content for when you come back and you're making a billion dollars a year. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, Grant, is there anything else that you think is important for people to hear? Any last, I don't know, lesson you want to double down on? Anything you want to leave listeners with?

Grant Lee (01:46:48):
Yeah, I mean, just going back to the original story of that was probably the ultimate low point. Having an investor that spent 20 minutes listening to my pitch, telling me that it was the worst thing, worst idea in the world. I think throughout the journey there's going to be those low moments. And when I think about being a founder and working a startup, you're honestly just trying to increase your luck surface area as much as possible. And for me, luck surface area has two dimensions. The first dimension is people. Who are you surrounding yourself with that share your same ambition, share the same values, same principles, and find those people and then give yourself enough time to prove that you guys can accomplish great things. I'm lucky to have two amazing co-founders. We've been working on this thing for five years. There's 0% chance we'd be where we are if I didn't have them. And we've had to overcome a lot. But I guess for us it's like creating that own luck over a long time horizon has been the only way that it's been possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:48):
Well, it's clearly showing in the success you guys are having. Grant, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Grant Lee (01:47:56):
Yep. Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:47:57):
All right. I've got five questions for you. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Grant Lee (01:48:07):
Yeah, so I'll give one that's for pre-product market fit folks and the one post-product market fits.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:48:07):
Perfect.

Grant Lee (01:48:12):
Pre-product market fit I would say is Shoe Dog, which is written by Phil Knight, founder of Nike. And he talks about two things. One, you should chase your sort of crazy ideas, but these should be ideas you're passionate about. He was an athlete, and so not surprisingly, he focused a lot about creating tools or shoes in this case for other athletes and was passionate about that. And the second thing he taught me was going back to the team thing, he surrounded himself with other people that were super passionate about athletics and shoes as well. And so the folks that he had as his initial startup crew were all that.

(01:48:49):
And I think that gives you a chance of overcoming a ton, where you're focused on problems you actually care about solving, and you're dealing with a team that shares the same ambition as you. Post-product market fit, there's a book called 7 Powers by Hamilton Helmer, where I think when you think about how to build a durable business, there's so much in there. I think there's a lot that you can kind of read and reread as you kind of evolve and hit new milestones yourself. And so much of that can be both tactical but also zooming out and thinking about what are the big picture strategic questions you as a founding team you need to be thinking about. So both are great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:21):
Hamilton was on the podcast, we'll link to that episode. I also love that book. Many people mention it. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Grant Lee (01:49:31):
Yeah, The Lazarus Project is one, I'm a huge sucker for time travel and sci-fi, so this is one I just started watching. And for me, it has all the right ingredients for a fun show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:49:44):
Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Grant Lee (01:49:47):
Yeah, I mentioned this already, Voicepanel. So again, a full disclosure angel investor, but we've been using it and going back to kind of being a cheat code for folks that are starting to experiment a ton with different ideas, vibe coding, maybe some of these might get this into the hands of users, hear what they think about it. I think, and honestly can help speed up a lot of things and save you time from wasting time on the wrong ideas or ideas where there's no market.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:50:13):
Is there a life motto that you often find yourself coming back to in work or in life?

Grant Lee (01:50:18):
Yeah, so there's this Chinese idiom that my mom used to say, it's a [foreign language 01:50:24] which the translation is "A frog at the bottom of a well". And the story is like there's a frog at the bottom of the well. He looks up every night and he sees the world and he imagines he knows everything about the world. And then one day a bird comes along and describes all the things that he sees, the ocean, the mountains, and the frog realizes that what he sees is just such a limited part of the world and the bird asks, "Do you want to come join me?" And kind of see the rest of it. And so frog goes along.

(01:50:54):
And so for me, I came from a pretty modest childhood. My parents, we didn't have a whole lot and I think it would've been very easy to kind of have a very narrow lens on the world and be like, "Oh, this is what it is." But my mom never allowed me to do that. She always pulled me to dream much bigger to say, "Hey, the world is vast. It's your opportunity to seize it. You have to go out there, don't have a narrow view of what's possible. Always dream bigger." And so for me, that's always carried through and every time I feel like I'm thinking too little or too small, I try to zoom out and remind myself that there's much more out there to go after.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:51:30):
That is so good and so important and so valuable in today's world where so much more is possible. Just like, most of what limits people it feels like now is just, I don't know what idea I have. I don't know what to do. Now you could get things done so much quicker and so much more is possible. So that's such valuable thinking. Okay, final question. You help people present better. Your tools basically help people become better presenters. What's one tip you've learned or one tip you teach people to become better presenters that might be helpful to listeners?

Grant Lee (01:52:00):
Yeah, I mean, I'll go back to the consumer advertising concept, which is one idea at a time, this notion of you give them one egg, someone can catch it, give them too many eggs, they're going to drop it. So don't try to throw too many concepts all at once. Keep it simple. People will appreciate it. And so with every sort of presentation, break it down into the core concepts, try to make sure you're covering one at a time. And I think once you sort of see a through line there, then it becomes easy for it to package up into something that feels more cohesive.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:32):
Less is more, as they say.

Grant Lee (01:52:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:52:36):
Grant, two final questions. Where can folks find you online? Where can they find Gamma? What should they know? Just plug anything you want and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Grant Lee (01:52:44):
Yeah, so you can find me on both Twitter and LinkedIn, DM's open. I honestly hear just knowing how hard the journey is in general, whether just thinking about a startup idea or you're deep into startup land, I want to be hopefully helpful. I'm going to be hopefully your biggest cheerleader, so let me know how I can help. And then for us, we're always looking for feedback. So if you're trying Gamma, it's falling short of your expectations, let us know. We'd love to help in terms of just trying to make it better. And yeah, really appreciate all the feedback and support along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:16):
Grant, this was awesome. I really appreciate you making time. I know you're trying to build a crazy fast-growing startup with a lot going on, so I really appreciate you making time for this.

Grant Lee (01:53:24):
Thanks, Lenny. It's been a blast.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:53:24):
It's been a blast for me too. Bye everyone.

# Everyone’s an engineer now: Inside v0’s mission to create 100 million builders | Guillermo Rauch

## Transcript

Guillermo Rauch (00:00:00):
One of our users yesterday submitted feedback.

MUSIC (00:00:00):
(instrumental music)

Guillermo Rauch (00:00:02):
They were saying, "v0 is like a super genius five-year-old PhD with ADHD." I'm not going to oversell this. It knows everything about everything, but it has these sparks of brilliance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):
How do you think things are going to change for product managers, for product teams?

Guillermo Rauch (00:00:18):
People could be more full stack. Imagine a designer that can ship a fully baked product, a product manager that can prototype and ship to production. We shouldn't put limits on ourselves and what we can build, and what we can ship, and what we can dream about making possible on these web surfaces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:34):
A lot of people are wondering, "What happens to engineers? Should I learn how to code?"

Guillermo Rauch (00:00:37):
A lot of the programming jobs to be done that used to be specializations, I think, are going away, in a way. They're translation tasks, but knowing how things work under the hood is going to be very important for you because you're going to be able to influence the model and make it follow your intention a lot better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
We hear this word taste all the time, in terms of building taste, people are always like, "How the hell do I do that?"

Guillermo Rauch (00:00:57):
Taste, sometimes I think we think of as this inaccessible thing that, "Oh, that person was born with taste." I see it as a skill that it can develop. I think is extremely important to try lots of products. We have one of our internal operating principles as increasing exposure hours. Try to quantify how much time you expose yourself to watching how people use your products and you'll develop that muscle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:25):
Where do you think the biggest change is going to happen?

Guillermo Rauch (00:01:26):
We need to stop talking about AI at some point. I just see a future where AI becomes synonymous with software. We build software and we use software to build software.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:38):
Today my guest is Guillermo Rauch. Guillermo is the founder and CEO of Vercel, which, amongst other things, makes a product called v0, which has become one of the most popular AI website building tools in the world. He's also a legendary engineer and contributor to open source. He's created some of those popular JavaScript frameworks in the world like Next.js and Socket.IO. He's both a builder and is building a product that's going to change the way we all build products in the future. This episode is incredible. If you want to really understand how product development is going to change with the rise of AI and what skills you should be focusing on right now, I highly recommend you keep listening.

Guillermo Rauch (00:04:50):
Thanks for having me. Longtime listener, first time, I guess participating in the podcast, and love being here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):
Oh, I appreciate that. Okay, I know you saw this, I did this survey recently where I asked my readers, "What tools do you use most in your day-to-day work as a product builder, as or product manager?" And in the category of engineering tools, v0 came in right below Cursor and GitHub for people's most used AI building tools. So clearly people love what you're doing.

Guillermo Rauch (00:05:18):
Yeah, we're very happy to see that. And for us, we're at the very beginning of the journey in some ways, because v0 is a relatively new tool, but for Vercel, our company has been around for a while. The way that I explain to people is, "Anytime you're using the internet, if there's a website or web application that's really fast, innovative, hopefully it's running on our platform." We're out there. We are running a lot of websites at scale. If you watched the Super Bowl recently, three different companies were promoting digital products that were built and delivered on Vercel. So not only can you deploy your ideas and build them on Vercel, they can scale to huge volumes of traffic and huge audiences. 

(00:05:58):
So a lot of people know us because of a framework called Next.js. It's an open source framework based on the React technology, open source by Meta, and it powers some of the most innovative products on the internet. So when you use Claude, or Grok, or Midjourney, you're using Next.js. You're using Vercel's technologies. So with v0, what we're trying to do is, and it's funny, because you put us rightfully, I think, in the building or development category in that survey, but what we're trying to do with v0 is help more people participate in building software, increase the total addressable market of people that are actually shipping things, shipping real products. And at the same time, just like you would with ChatGPT, we want v0 to be just extremely, extremely easy, and the outputs that it generates, make them as refined and realistic as possible. The things that you created with v0 hopefully live up to that standard set by some of the best and largest websites on the internet.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):
I was going to ask you how v0 came out of Vercel, and my theory was it was like you guys are sitting around being like, "How do we get more people building websites?" And it's like, "Okay, let's just help them do it really easily." It's like TAM expansion for Vercel. Is that?

Guillermo Rauch (00:07:17):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:17):
Or it-

Guillermo Rauch (00:07:19):
In some ways what I've been doing for not only 10 years that I've been almost working on Vercel, but maybe my entire life because my strength as a developer is kind of meta. It's been to create developer tools. So I've created a bunch of open source frameworks that are really popular. So Next.js is one, but before that in a previous life, I created another tool called Socket.IO, which is a real-time communication mechanism that powers, for example, every time you use Notion, I think you interviewed Ivan, when Notion is to broadcast messages in real time to other collaborators, they use a real-time engine that I built for Socket.IO. 

(00:07:59):
So the reason that startups and companies have used my products in the past is because I took something that was very difficult to do, but very compelling. It was with real-time in the past. It's building cutting-edge applications on the web with Next.js. And I try to make it as easy as possible. But you still needed to know development skills. For us and the opportunity was if there is maybe five million React developers, which is the the library engine that we use, and there's maybe 20 million JavaScript developers, how many product builders are people with aspirations of building products exist? My back of the napkin, minimum calculation is a hundred million. 

(00:08:45):
And I'll tell you, it's funny where I get that number from. Slack has about a hundred million monthly active users. And what you do on Slack is you go in IT and you talk to people. A lot of those people are building digital products. And they talk to one another about what they would want to see in the world. They talk to customers through shared channels. I love that feature. We talk to a lot of the Vercel customers and they tell us, like, "I want to build this, I want to see that. I want this feature, I want that thing." So the opportunity with v0 was, it's not that you're going to stop talking to other people, but what if you could yap into the computer and see something happen, build a prototype, build your first version of a product, build a demo, build a full stack product, build it and ship it?

(00:09:30):
And so the inspiration for it was very natural to the mission of Vercel. But concretely, the genesis, the story was when ChatGPT came out, we noticed that it was very good at writing the code that our tools used. So ChatGPT, right out of the bat, was good at JavaScript, was good at Tailwind, which is a CSS styling technology, was good at Next.js, and again, the power of open source. Our tools were already in the training data of the internet. And so that long-term bet and vision in open source really paid off. So because the models were so good at writing this kind of code, the idea for v0 came naturally from, "What if we could build a ChatGPT for building web products?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:14):
Speaking of that, I didn't actually know. So I had Bolt's CEO on the podcast and he talked about how Claude kind of unlocked what they're doing and do you guys sit on ChatGPT and OpenAI's stuff?

Guillermo Rauch (00:10:25):
We started out on OpenAI. And we've always used a combination of models. It's funny, right now on Twitter there's thread with a million views of people trying to reverse engineer the prompt and the models they used. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:25):
I saw that on Reddit. Yeah.

Guillermo Rauch (00:10:36):
And they're all finding that there is all these kinds of different models that are specialists in different tasks. And there's a pipeline of models where a model could hand off work to another model. And so OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, but we predate Anthropic because I'll give credit to ChatGPT that the utility of it was so general purpose, but from the very first release, it was very good. In fact, by the way, if I'm not mistaken, the first prototype of v0 might have even predated ChatGPT, or at the very least I think we were running on GPT 3.5. So we've always had this vision of unlocking more power for the web through LLMs, and there's a lot of very interesting technical details of why, by the way, LMs happen to be so good at the task of web design and web development that we could get into. But it was the perfect timing for us.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):
I want to come back to that. That's actually a really good question. But let me ask a couple other questions here. In terms of v0, what's the scale at this point? We hear all these numbers about all the folks in the space. What can you share about what's happening with v0?

Guillermo Rauch (00:11:45):
I can share that it's growing exponentially, and that over 1.3 million users have interacted with v0 so far. We had our largest day ever yesterday and today, again, we're one of the largest customers of most of cloud providers at this point. We're hitting the limits of every GPU, LLM infrastructure out there in the planet. And the most exciting thing for me is what I'm seeing people build with v0. So we launched a feature about a month ago, maybe even less than a month ago, called v0 Community. It already has 20,000 submissions. I am sure people in your audience have used Figma, one of the things that I love about Figma is Figma files, that I can go and grab a starting point for something. It could be a logo, could be a menu, and you can start with something that someone has already contributed, like that spirit of open source.

(00:12:44):
And so in less than a month, I think we've done over 20,000 community submissions. So we've learned so much about building AI products with this and we continue to open source and share our best practices. But one of the things that I've definitely learned is prompting it seems like the easiest interface in the world because it's just an input and you put text in it. But there's a little bit of a writer's block sometimes. So one of my favorite things that I've seen, and I'm even looking at the home page right now, and you can see a random assortment of community submissions. And they have 1,200 forks, and 1,500 forks, and 6,000 forks, and this is every time people saying like, "Oh, instead of starting from scratch, I'll start from this application that someone else has built and I'm going to prompt it to modify it and make it my own."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:34):
So the community submissions are people building apps on v0 and sharing what they built?

Guillermo Rauch (00:13:39):
Correct. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:39):
You can look at the code and fork it?

Guillermo Rauch (00:13:40):
It is becoming like a compounding investment. People share something, someone else grabs it, makes it better. Maybe you used it at that point. In many ways, I see this as the next evolution of GitHub, whereas GitHub, it was a marvel for software development because I don't know if you remember this, but the initial, little tagline underneath the GitHub logo was social coding. And it had this democratization effect of building software. But you still needed to know how to code. And so what we're after is social product building in many ways, everybody should be able to cook and share what they're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
I hadn't thought of it this way, but I love that it connects so much to your open source roots, where people are building on v0, and then sharing what they're building and then people can build off those things. It's kind like an open source AI building experience.

Guillermo Rauch (00:14:36):
It's fascinating, right? In many ways, if you think about the Git commit, the Git commit is super interesting. If you watch how an engineer works, they look at a problem, they spend a lot of time in their code editor, and at the end they say, "I think I got it. I think I've fixed it." And then they produce a Git commit. They summarize their intent and what they try to do after they've done the work. v0 inverts that. The Git commit is you go into the chat and say, "Please change the color of this button. And when I click it, save this form to a database." And so you're starting with the intent and the output is the code. 

(00:15:26):
And as a side effect, we can also produce a Git commit for you. That feature's not online yet, but it's coming in the next couple of days. Spoiler alert for the group. And so I like this idea of we can create this super set of all software building with this platform. And that is true to my initial intention with Vercel. Our mission is to enable the world to build and ship the best products. And so enabling that for the largest possible group of people is very exciting to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:55):
So let's go to this question of just the elephant in the room for a lot of people seeing these things happening, product builders that have been doing things a certain way for a long time with apps like this coming around, whether you could just type a thing in, and build it for you, and it's beautiful. How do you think things are going to change for product managers, for product teams? Where do you think the biggest change is going to happen? How do you think product will be built in the next few years?

Guillermo Rauch (00:16:19):
The most profound one that I alluded to is that conversations between product builders and their customers will be mediated by these zero links, these artifacts. I think when Claude came up with the name artifacts, I found it phenomenal, because we're all in this world, especially in this group of people, we're here to build awesome things and share them with the world. Steve Jobs said this awesome speech about, "It's like our form of giving back to the world is to try and do the best possible job we can and share it with the world." And so the idea that when we talk, we would not have the power to make those ideas a reality, it seems like an L to me. I would love to see people constantly live in the product, be in the design, spend time tuning and trying out new ideas. And that's what the ideal work of the future should look like, and less about again, that abstraction, that being removed from the product or even sometimes I can feel powerless to not be able to change something. 

(00:17:47):
This happens a lot when departments collaborate within an organization. Marketing wants design to do something, marketing wants engineering, engineering needs a design. It cuts always. One of the things that people got excited about that we published on the Vercel blog was about design engineering, because a lot of the people that we were noticing were being very successful at Vercel were people that had both the design and engineering skills. And that was actually another huge motivator and inspiration for v0, because we realized that people could be more full stack. We shouldn't put limits on ourselves, and what we can build, and what we can ship, and what we can dream about making possible on these web surfaces. 

(00:18:36):
And so you could imagine removing all those limitations, a designer that can ship a fully-baked product, a product manager that can prototype and shift to production. A lot of people that use v0 are back-end engineers that never had the ability to, they could ship an API, they could build a great low-level infrastructure system, but to actually bring their end-to-end vision to life, v0's completing that for them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:07):
Let me follow the thread on engineers. A lot of people are wondering, "Do we need engineers in the future? What happens to engineers? Should I learn how to code?" Your long-time engineer thoughts for folks that are trying to decide the career for themselves?

Guillermo Rauch (00:19:21):
Yeah, I think knowing how things work is the most important skill in the world. I foresee a lot of people becoming incredibly impactful in building and shipping amazing products, and building gigantic companies, and everything you could imagine, where a single person can do the job of a hundred different people in a hundred different specializations. Take the example of one skill set that's really important to build a front-end product is you need to know how to use CSS or Tailwind to style it. And once upon a time, I would hire people that were truly specialists in this task, the task of there's a Figma design or there is some kind of sketch, and translating that into reality because they knew really well how to manipulate layouts, layout code, box model code, we call it, and borders, paddings, margins, flex box, all these technologies for styling. 

(00:20:32):
And notice, I actually use the word translation very intentionally, because the origin of the LLM or the transform architecture at least, goes as far back as the architecture for systems like Google Translate. They were generative LLM techniques, basically. That's how they cross that chasm of, remember when translating tools were horrible and then one day the problem was just solved? And I look at a lot of the programming jobs to be done that used to be specializations, that I think are going away, in a way, or the tasks to be done, they're translation tasks. We were translating from a screenshot, or intent, or a design into a React, and Tailwind, and CSS implementation. 

(00:21:32):
And right now, v0 is incredibly good at doing that. It's so good that every time we put a new generation of the model out, I run this test of converting my own website and try to generate it with v0. Last time I did it, it had taken me like 10 prompts to replicate it. Keep in mind I'm an expert front-end engineer that's been in the arena since I'm like 10 years old and I'm 35 now. And so I do that test because it's almost like a test of self-imposed humility of, like, "I remember exactly how long it took me to build my website with Next.js, the framework that I created, and ship it." And so with the last model, it took me maybe 10, 15 prompts? With the most recent model, it took me two prompts. 

(00:22:22):
And so that translation from the design intent into working implementation, another anecdote that I like to share with people is the model, because v0 tries to embed all of the best practices of the web, the model output more accessible code than what I wrote. It follows the accessibility guidelines that the web standards consortiums put out better than I did, because it just knows everything. And so those tasks where you can almost model it to a translation task, definitely going away. But knowing how things work under the hood, notice all the ... I'm using specific tokens in this conversation. I'm saying, "CSS," I'm saying, "Layout." I'm naming styles. Knowing those tokens is going to be very important for you because you're going to be able to influence the model and make it follow your intention a lot better. 

(00:23:22):
And so the TLDR would be knowing how things work, the symbolic systems, and that will mean that you have to probably go into each subject with less depth. I have engineers at Vercel that know every single CSS property by heart. They know when they became available in a certain web browser, they've been tracking this specification. It's almost like you're an encyclopedia of knowledge of each CSS property. You probably won't need that in the future, and probably that's good, because you'll free up your mind for more ambitious things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):
No, that's fascinating. So what I'm hearing is a skill that will continue to be valuable in the future, but I want to push on this a little bit, no matter how far AI gets, is understanding conceptually how software works, end-to-end-

Guillermo Rauch (00:24:14):
Yes. Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:14):
... systems, databases, CSS is a thing. So I don't know if you have kids, whether you have kids or not, just say they were trying to decide, "What should I learn to be, to thrive in this future?" Well, how would you summarize it? How far? Should they get into software engineering? 

Guillermo Rauch (00:24:31):
Great question, because I have five kids, and I've already enrolled them in this school of G, myself, in the sense that I'm already guiding them towards the things I think are going to be very useful to them. So understanding how things work needs, I think the ability to understand the fundamental logic behind things, incredibly valuable. So I push them really hard on math. "If you don't know math really well, you're out of my house." Just kidding. But it's a fundamental skill that I want them to know. Eloquence. I joke sometimes. Have you heard a meme of word cells versus-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:13):
Yeah- [inaudible 00:25:13]

Guillermo Rauch (00:25:13):
... shape rotators?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:14):
Yeah.

Guillermo Rauch (00:25:14):
So a shape rotator is someone that only has a math brain. You could argue the kings and queens of Silicon Valley have been the shape rotators, because those have been the jobs that have historically commanded the most status, respect, net worth, whatever. And then there's the word cells, which is communicating, more of the liberal arts. There's also the funny and awesome slide of Apple saying that they're at the intersection of liberal arts and technology. I've always had immense amounts of respect for both sides of the brain, so to speak. But I think developing great eloquence, and knowing and memorizing those tokens that I talked about, knowing how to refer to things in that global mental map of symbolic systems will be highly valuable. And we have some tools to help people prompt better, but prompt enhancement and embellishment cannot replace thinking and cannot replace your own creativity that you want to infuse into the world.

(00:26:18):
So one of the things that v0 does is it tries and it succeeds, I think, at creating very nice designs out of the box. We try to infuse what we've learned about what do people think is typically good web design? We've influenced the model in that direction. But still we also don't want the whole internet to look the same way. So your ability to steer the model with your words into those references, into those inspirations, is going to be very important. 

(00:26:49):
I actually have an amazing anecdote. We hosted a design demo night at the Vercel HQ in San Francisco last night. And we were showing off how Vercel uses v0 to build v0 and to build Vercel. And one of our designers showed this amazing animation that he built, actually two amazing animations that he built. And in one of them it was this amazing triangle that had an animation that I didn't think was possible to make, in that it was all built with v0. And he used the word turbulence to describe the effect that he wanted.

(00:27:30):
So I just want to call out that to people because the difference between knowing that word and not knowing it is getting that style into that beautiful triangle that he created that was interactive, and it's probably going to end up in some landing page soon that you're going to visit on vercel.com. And so developing eloquence and your linguistic ability I think is going to be very important. So I love my kids to know that. And I think that idea of sharing things, and putting yourself out there, and broadcasting to the world, so another thing that I do is I take my kids to hackathons, which just went to an awesome hackathon at University of San Francisco, USF. It was called the BLOOM Hackathon. And I took two of my kids and I wanted them to watch how people presented their ideas and we had a lot of fun. We also ate waffles and grilled sandwiches, which is a bonus. 

(00:28:29):
So presenting and putting yourself out there. I mentioned in the beginning of the podcast when we were chatting, I've learned so much from you and your guests because you put out all these awesome little posts on X in these videos and these snippets of your interviews. And so the ability to present what you've built and put yourself out there, incredibly important skill in the future. Especially in a world where the marginal cost of producing software and new things are going down, you need to build an audience, you need to know how to talk to people, you need to build your own signature brand and style. And so maybe they're a little too young for that one, but I guess taking them into hackathons probably back, is influencing their neural networks or pre-training data for the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:19):
I love it. They're going to tell their friends, "My dad took me to a hackathon." "What's that?" So are you encouraging to learn to code? Because it's interesting you mentioned-

Guillermo Rauch (00:29:29):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:29):
... math, eloquence, presenting, and then, okay, so also learn to code.

Guillermo Rauch (00:29:32):
Yeah, I think again, learning how to prompt, learning how to code. With v0, we show you the code when we build things. So if you can build that mapping of maybe not learning how to code necessarily as an abstraction, if you do have a knack for it, I'm a big believer also that my five kids have super diverse personalities and inclinations, and I don't want to be pushing for something that they wouldn't want to do or whatever. And so learning to code in the abstract might be good for some people, but it may not be the fun thing to do for other people. And so what I would recommend is try to understand how things work. So if you prompt v0 or any other tool and it generates some code, try to build an understanding of what that does at a high level. It's like actually maybe an extension even of eloquence.

(00:30:32):
One of the bets that I made early on with Vercel that really paid off is Vercel, maybe as a metaphor is like AWS in easy mode for a lot of people. We have a very large user base of people that would have otherwise not have been able to configure all of the ins and outs of the cloud, but do want the scale, flexibility, speed, et cetera. They want to create very high quality products and services. So I like to give the Super Bowl example because one of our customers, Ramp, had a 43X increase in traffic when their ad went live. The engineer that worked on that only needed to learn Next.js. Then they pushed their code to Vercel and now they can reach an audience of a hundred million people without a blip, a hundred percent uptime.

(00:31:24):
That superpower comes from, we made it as easy as possible to get started, and the language that we choose is actually very relevant in this story. JavaScript, in my mind, has always been almost like the English of programming languages. It's a language that, if you learn it, you reach billions of devices. So it's not a coincidence that when you ask ChatGPT, or Anthropic, or Gemini to build you web app, it uses these tools. It uses JavaScript, it uses React. It's become the lingua franca of building products on the web. So I would say to my kids, "Look, if you do want to go deeper into programming, start learning there." You can reach huge numbers of people. If you have a passion, I would say there's going to be a fundamental engineering skill that's going to be useful for decades or centuries to come, which is creating foundational infrastructure.

(00:32:26):
Think about LLMs in terms of, they're like Oracles that can go and write software for you, but there's a limit to how much software they can write. There's context windows, there is time and computational constraints. So it's very hard for an agent today to go and say, "I'm going to write a cloud from scratch. I'm going to write all the foundational services. I'm going to write the framework from scratch. I'm going to write the compiler." No, the LM is orchestrating those tools and infrastructure. It's not writing the compiler from scratch. Otherwise, you get into the Newton thing, in order to create an Apple, you have to create the entire underlying universe. No, the elements are interoperating with the universe as it exists. And so the engineers that learn foundational infrastructure are probably going to be extremely empowered still, for years to come.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:23):
There's a world where you could argue ChatGPT will build the next version of ChatGPT. What I'm hearing from you is that's a long ways away, if ever.

Guillermo Rauch (00:33:30):
Absolutely. This is why the common, the running joke is that all of these companies have, you go to their careers page. It's like-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:40):
Engineers.

Guillermo Rauch (00:33:41):
... "Engineer, engineer, engineer." The counterpoint of that is that at Vercel had, we have 150 engineers that can write code and 600 total headcount. Now we have 600 engineers. Some of the best things that I've seen created with v0 have not come from our engineering team. They've come from the marketing team, they've come from the sales team, they've come from the product management team. The product management team is fascinating, because now they're actually building the product. So last night I saw how we've specced out in v0, think of it as like a live PRD, we've specced out how the new functionality for deploying a v0 to Vercel is going to work. 

(00:34:26):
The amount of detail that was contained in that v0, I mean, we're all just saying, "Well, just ship it. There's nothing else to discuss." It was animated, it was interactive. We were demonstrating the error state, the success state, the slow stream state. So it really empowers product builders not only with technical skills, I think that does a disservice to the tool. It empowers them to explore and augment their thinking with a lot of things that perhaps they wouldn't have considered otherwise, a lot of states of the product they wouldn't have considered otherwise.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:05):
The name v0 implies the product is for prototypes for the first attempt at stuff. And that's definitely where all these tools are finding product market fit prototypes, PMs showing a thing working versus just design. Do you expect v0 and other tools to get to a place where you can build salesforce.com and scale it to billions of dollars? Do you-

Guillermo Rauch (00:35:05):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):
You do? Okay.

Guillermo Rauch (00:35:27):
We already have an enterprise customer of v0 that only works with v0. All of their products, all of their features, all of their client communications are v0 native. Two days ago, I just heard anecdotally on X, someone tells me, "My brother just sold his first website to a client completely built in v0." Yesterday at an investor conference, an investor walks up to me and says, "Two of my friends just got engaged on v0." I was like, "Okay, v0 is a dating app now." So the engagement website, the proposal, the wedding, it's all v0 native. 

(00:36:07):
So because we've integrated v0, the Vercel infrastructure, we can do that whole story that I just told you of like, "I have a website to build and I can get it in front of a hundred million people." We can enable that for everybody now. And so the end-to-end full stack, v0 native, and built on this awesome fluid serverless infrastructure that scales to billions of people, all just from prompts, or screenshots, or just copying and pasting your PRDs into the tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:42):
Let's help people be successful with v0. And then let's also do a demo. But before we get there, let me ask you this. Imagine you could magically sit next to someone who's about to use v0 for the first time and whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with v0. What would a couple tips be?

Guillermo Rauch (00:36:59):
Number one is you can be as ambitious as you want in terms of what you ask the tool. If you can steer the tool towards some kind of inspiration that you have, you're always going to get better results. If you don't have ideas on what to build or what to prompt, I would recommend using the v0 community so that you can find something to fork to get started. I would say in some ways, if you have technical skills, this one is interesting, have some suspension of disbelief. It humbled me, I was saying about accessibility. So be open-minded about whether the tool actually knows some things that you might not know, and so focus more on the product description, focus more on what do you want the end user to experience? What do you want the product to do? And try to be open-minded about how well the tool can implement it. Those would be my main wants. 

(00:38:04):
You also have to have a sense of iteration, I guess. Think of it this way, if you were working with a design firm or an agency that you've hired, you will go back and forth and say, "Try something else." If you were coaching an engineer that's getting stuck in something, you would say, "Try something else." It's amazing how many times I've gotten unstuck in v0 by just saying, "Just try something else."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:35):
Just saying that as the prompt, not even giving direct-

Guillermo Rauch (00:38:37):
Just saying that. I mean, the chat is like-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:37):
Wow.

Guillermo Rauch (00:38:43):
"v0, we need to have ... " It's like, "Yeah." Like you have a one-on-one performance review with a tool. "Hey, way to talk, try something else. What you're doing so far is not working. And it's amazing." One fitness function that I'm keeping in my head is I really want to find the thing that it cannot build with v0. So as part of the v0 community, I have my own profile. We'll share the link with people. You can see six or seven things that I've built that I consider to be pretty impressive. So for example, I was flying from Tokyo to San Francisco. The internet was horrible. What I like to do during flights is I like to monitor our own flight while I'm on the flight. So I open Flightradar or whatever, and I was extremely bored as well.

(00:39:32):
And I noticed that Flightradar, I don't know which one it was, Flightradar, there's like four or five of them. They were very bloated. They had ads. They were not what I wanted the flight radar to look like. So I built my own during the flight with the worst internet connection that you could imagine in the world, integrated into a flight data API called Edge Aviation. So this is what I told v0, "You're going to build the best flight radar on the planet." I wasn't prescriptive at how, so it used a tool called Mapbox and a JavaScript library called Leaflet. I didn't tell him that, or her, I don't know, v0, what it is. And subsequently, once we cooked on the design, which looks, I would say beautiful, I then got more ambitious and I said, "All right, let's make it real now." 

(00:40:30):
And by the way, that's actually how I would work. So it's how I like to work. I like to work experience first, and that's also how Vercel was built. "Let's start with the front end. Let's start with the planes on the screen." And by the way, there's a lot of subtleties, here. For example, there's so many flights going on at any given time that there's just too many. So I had to work with v0 on improving performance. And once again, I wasn't prescriptive. I just said, "We have a lot of flights, chief. Let's- " 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:02):
Did you say, "Chief?"

Guillermo Rauch (00:41:03):
Yeah, I do say that a lot. And this is, I think when I shared it on X, it blew a lot of engineers' minds, because it created a canvas-based, canvas is the sort of underlying rendering surface that very sophisticated products use like Figma. And it created this awesome overlay on top of the map that can render tens of thousands of flights at any given time. And then I told it, "Let's make it a full stack application. Okay, plug into the flights' API." So that's an example of we cooked and there was no limit. And so I'm always in the lookout. The service that I'm providing to the v0 community is I'm part of the team that is really trying to break this and say, "Can it not build something?" And even when it does build it, we're very obsessed with quality and performance. It has to be real. That's our commitment to our users.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
And how much did this cost, how much time does this take to make something like this?

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:06):
So the flight radar example or v0?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:08):
Yeah, the flight radar example specifically just like very-

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:11):
I mean, that one probably took less than two hours-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
Less than two hours?

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:13):
... with the worst internet. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Yeah, what-

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:15):
Sorry, Japan Airlines, I love you, but you give me a hard time. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:18):
And what did that cost? Like 10 bucks? What would you estimate? 

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:24):
I mean, I pay for the $20 v0 subscription.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:25):
20 bucks, okay, for a month. So it's like a month, but you used it for two hours, 20 bucks. 

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:31):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:31):
If you had engineers building this, how much do you think that would cost? How long do you think that would take?

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:36):
I mean, weeks, easily. Easily.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
And that's like tens of thousands of dollars.

Guillermo Rauch (00:42:42):
Maybe the most cracked engineer at Vercel could knock it out in ... without using any AI, could knock it out in a couple days. But then what about the design? What about me? Because I'm the bottleneck, not the engineer. And this is what's amazing about this collaboration because I'm providing the product guidance. I'm saying, "Draw a dashed line between the ... " And by the way, v0 just blew my mind so hard. I said, "Draw a dashed line between the two destination airports." And v0 said, "Well, I have to account for the spherical, or what is it, it's a pseudosphere, for the curvature of the earth." It's like, "Okay, v0, super genius, whatever." And so that's what I mentioned about how you can go back and forth. It's like a product copilot, it's like an all-knowing being. 

(00:43:40):
One of our users yesterday submitted feedback to the tool and it was positive feedback. They were very happy, what they were saying, "v0 is a super genius five-year old PhD with ADHD." So you still have to, I'm not going to oversell this like, "It knows everything about everything. It gives everything perfect," of course. But it has these sparks of brilliance. Really, truly, I think, I've been a big believer that AGI undersells what we are collectively building because we already have, all of this sparks of super intelligence. I don't believe that v0 is an AGI if it knows everything about how to draw a dashed line according to the curvature of the earth and this high-performance map of airplanes. That's just superhuman. And yeah, it's a joy to use.

MUSIC (00:44:39):
(instrumental music)

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:40):
Today's episode is brought to you by LinkedIn ads. One of the hardest and also most important parts of B2B marketing is reaching the right people. I'm constantly getting ads for products that I will never buy. And I almost feel sorry for the money that these companies are spending, pitching me on their spend management software or some kind of cybersecurity solution that my one-man business just does not need. When you're ready to reach the right professionals use LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn has grown to a network of over one billion professionals, including 130 million decision makers. And that's where it stands apart from other ad platforms. You can target your ad buyers by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, even company revenue, all the professionals that you need to reach in one place. Stop wasting budget on the wrong audience and start targeting the right professionals only on LinkedIn ads. LinkedIn will even give you $100 credit on your next campaign so that you can try it for yourself. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny, that's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply only on LinkedIn ads.  

(00:45:48):
As you talk, it's interesting, the way I'm thinking about this now, there's almost like three core skills in building apps with AI. There's figuring out what to build, there's making it look good, like design, and then there's getting it unstuck. 

Guillermo Rauch (00:46:02):
Yeah,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:03):
And it's interesting how these are going to move.

Guillermo Rauch (00:46:05):
And coaching.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):
Coaching it. Yeah. Or just like, "Oh, here's the database error. I don't know. It's not figuring it out."

Guillermo Rauch (00:46:12):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):
I guess does that resonate? I've never thought about [inaudible 00:46:16] before.

Guillermo Rauch (00:46:15):
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I'll tell you a little bit of a story of something. So even going way back in time, Next.js builds on React. React was this UI component library that Facebook created, actually with very similar goals. They had so many cracked engineers, and they had to help them collaborate on an enormous product surface. So they invented or at least pioneered, I would say the concept of this component as a unit of reusability, as a building block, as a Lego brick of how you build software. It's no coincidence that LLMs love to work with React components, by the way. And one of the things that always has stood out to me about that model is it basically enables people to scale in how they work together. And one of the key design principles that they embedded into this thing, is they called it escape hatch.

(00:47:17):
The API, when when React doesn't perfectly model your problem with its component system, they give you escape hatch. They say, "Okay, engineer. You are on your own now. There's no guardrails." And in fact, one of these escape hatches is called dangerously set inner HTML. They want the developer to know uncharted territory. But they did give people the API. That is a profound systems design engineering principle. And throughout my life, I've always thought about escape hatches. 

(00:47:54):
One amazing escape hatch that v0 has is that you're looking at the code that we're generating with Next.js. You can edit it, you can even have other experts look at it. One thing that one of our demos last night came from this awesome company, Lumalabs. They're creating one of the most amazing video models in the world, and they use v0 and Vercel extensively to build their application, their websites, et cetera. And the design engineer was talking about how he was on a v0 that had 120 or so iterations. So he was knee-deep into the latent space. He was in the matrix. And at one point he got stuck. But you know what he did? He copied and pasted the code that we generated and he gave it to ChatGPT o1 and ChatGPT o1 thought about the solution.

(00:48:51):
Honestly, I'd never even thought about this myself. I was so blown away. And it does speak to, I love that your third point of, "You need to learn a skill of how to get unstuck." It's like a profound life lesson. It's just more a generic life advice you need to get. Facebook actually had a principle, "Don't get blocked. Seek to get unblocked, seek help from other people." What's fascinating is that you can seek help from other AIs to get unstuck. And those escape hatches of actually understanding and seeing the code underneath, and even being able to say, "Okay, now let's use Git. Let's turn this into more of a hybrid project, not just prompts, but also traditional software engineering." The fact that that door is open to you is extremely valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:44):
Let's actually make the super concrete and show people what this actually looks like in v0. So pull up, we'll share screen, and then we'll do a little live demo. We'll keep it brief. I find people are like, "Okay, I get it." But we'll make it fun and brief at the same time. There it is. I see it.

Guillermo Rauch (00:49:59):
Beautiful. Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:00):
How can I help you ship?

Guillermo Rauch (00:50:02):
Yeah, of course. We're all about shipping. Okay, so as I mentioned, you write in English, you yap into the tool. I'll say for a demo, let's create a contact sales form in the style of ... By the way, I had a typo. I don't care. Let's get it. It's Elf Supreme, the clothing company for an online store. Now, I mentioned that sometimes people get blocked, there is a writer paralysis at this step. So we added enhanced prompt. So now you're tapping into the latent space of the model, which has a random component to it. 

(00:50:48):
And by the way, this is still not a substitute. It doesn't contradict what I said earlier, knowing the meaningful tokens, knowing what the right style is, and what it's called, and whatever is still highly valuable. So the first thing you're going to notice is that as the model thinks, you can introspect its thinking. So we added this recently. It's been mostly inspired actually by the Deepseek revolution. I would say. 

(00:51:17):
So the fact that when you tell it, "Develop a contact sales form," what is it going to do? We talked about escape hatches. Okay, it's going to use shadcn/ui, it's going to use Tailwind CSS, it's going to use React. And this is your opportunity that if v0 is not doing exactly what you wanted, this is your opportunity to actually go and correct, or influence, or give feedback and so on. So you're going to notice it spits out a bunch of files, and it gives me the thing that I wanted. I'm going to zoom out a little bit, here. A couple of things that stand out here that again, as an experienced engineer, I can point out. The underlying component system that it uses is the same component system that the best tools on the planet are built with. This is called shadcn. If you go to grok.com today, they're using shadcn to build their UI. They're using Next.js. You're getting that caliber of code. 

(00:52:15):
The other thing that it did is people on social media talk about this a lot. When you use a global shared component system with the world, you don't want everything to look the same. So the fact that he was able to apply the style and he kind of knew what supreme looked like was kind of cool. But now I'm going to say, "Actually, because I am building a financial institution, make it more serious, make it in the style of let's say Charles Schwab. Change typefaces.' So this is the iteration process of like, "I'm going to go and give feedback to the model. I'm going to make it try different things." So once that initial generation was already created, now the model is actually acting more as an editor. It's going and making tweaks to what's already been built.

(00:53:08):
And this actually scales to very large projects. You could have started with something much bigger. So in the meantime, I'm going to show you what Lumalabs created with v0, which is absolutely phenomenal. I learned about this last night. It already has 2,000 forks. I was telling you about the power of our community. So by the way, you can just click community here on the v0 sidebar. I'm going to fork it, because they generously shared it with the world. Notice all the incredible animations here? By the way, they shipped this to hire and attract talent to their company. I recommend them, by the way, you should, if you want to be a brand designer, take them into consideration. Notice that it's an interactive, everything is AI generated, they used their own AI image generation tool to create these beautiful frames. These are all AI generated as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):
Wow.

Guillermo Rauch (00:54:00):
And it's interactive. So there is the autoplaying functionality. This is actually a complex layout in animation system that they built entirely in v0. I was telling you that at one point they even got some advice from O-Wan, so shout out to OpenAI. I'm going to say, "Make it sepia style colors." So this is an example of like, "Okay, I forked something. I already have a starting point." My bank grade contact form is ready. In the meantime, another fun thing to do is you can start with a screenshot. So I'll use another Next.js user as an example, which is fortune.com. Shout out to them. They built a slick website. 

(00:54:48):
But let's say that I'm actually wanting to break into the news business, so I'm just going to paste a screenshot. I could have also attached the Figma file. And I'm going to have, v0 already knows, v0 can answer questions as well about the engineering design product world. So I can ask v0, "What is a newsletter? Explain with a diagram. Use Lenny as an example." So v0 is also a knowledge seeking tool. But we do strongly like, "Steer the tool to create things." So if I paste a screenshot, as you can see, it's cooking on creating a hopefully awesome news website. I specifically asked, because I think it's funny, to explain a newsletter with a diagram, so v0 can create again, explanations, content, knowledge. The creator is Lenny, you were a former Airbnb product lead. I guess I should-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:55):
It's all- [inaudible 00:55:55]

Guillermo Rauch (00:55:54):
... have used some examples from Airbnb, by the way. But let's look at here-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:54):
It's all good.

Guillermo Rauch (00:55:59):
... what it created with Fortune.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:01):
Wow.

Guillermo Rauch (00:56:03):
So notice that, I'm just noticing now the cyber should have been on the center. I'm going to zoom out a little bit. Let's use the refinement tool to center this. I call this, by the way, one of the hardest problems in computer science is actually centering things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:26):
With CSS.

Guillermo Rauch (00:56:28):
That's right, centering a div. And in fact, look at it. It was a div. So notice that I did a precise inline prompt? And the difference between v0 and a lot of other tools is that yes, you do have the code and code is very important, but I call it code last rather than code first. You're living in the product. So center that. Another website that I love also built with Next.js is Semaphore. So I really like their sepia style. So I'm going to say, "Apply this style instead, including- " 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:09):
So you're sharing a screen. So you used a screenshot to design, to build a site, and now you're using a different screenshot to tell it, "Make it look like this."

Guillermo Rauch (00:57:16):
Yes. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):
Very cool.

Guillermo Rauch (00:57:21):
And so the idea is that v0 can Grok different aspects of what it needs to build. It can be functional aspects, it can be layout aspects. And one of the things that's also very important to know is we influence the model. So a lot of the things that you would have had to prompt you might get for free. One that's important to call out is responsiveness. So as an example, if I notice that if I do this, it's going to make it work quite well on mobile, it's going to give me that hamburger menu. I can now tell it like, "Apply that style to everything."

(00:58:00):
In the meantime, I'll show you, this is actually to me very, very impressive. And I don't know why today I'm so fixated on the theme of sepia. But notice that not only did it change the background, I hope people can notice this. It applied it to the checkboxes and it applied a CSS. I'm assuming this is a CSS filter. Yeah, it applied a CSS filter. Just for the sake of it, because I'm a nerd, I'm going to look at it. But yes, it applied a CSS filter. Confession time, I actually didn't know that there was a sepia function in the filter property of CSS. There were many ways to accomplish this. You could have also written the images or the videos to a canvas, and apply all kinds of algorithms, and whatever. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:48):
I like that it did more elegantly than you would have. 

Guillermo Rauch (00:58:51):
Yeah, exactly. So that's why you can't be too opinionated with the tool. So another cool thing is I do like showing screenshots, but I do want to remind people that the idea is not to clone other people's websites, necessarily. Right? It's-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:09):
It's just a cool demo. It's a simple way to show off what it can do.

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:11):
Exactly. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
Yeah.

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:12):
Take screenshots of your own things. Take screenshots of your art boards, take screenshots of things that people post in Slack, and also don't hesitate add functionality.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:22):
Incredible. Thank you for doing the demo. I'm just trying to imagine having an engineer I'm working with, asking them to do these things, and not only just how annoying that would be, like, "Make it sepia." 

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:23):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:32):
But just how much time it would take from, "Okay, do this thing, copy fortune.com." It'd be like days, weeks. Here, it's just-

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:32):
Months.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):
... check it out here. Months.

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:40):
If ever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:41):
Yeah.

Guillermo Rauch (00:59:41):
Maybe it never ships. 

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:44):
That's right. Well, something that I noticed that I loved at the beginning when you were doing the prompting and that prompt improvement feature is it basically is best practices to make it look good and look better. Which I think is one of the more interesting, I don't know, levers to working with AI is it just has best practices to help you build things that are beautiful and also feels like there's this opportunity of just helping you figure out if what you're building is at all a good idea. "What is the problem you're trying to solve?" It feels like there's a PM1 pager step that should exist. Like, "How do you know this is a problem? What have users told you? How many people have told you this?" Things like that.

Guillermo Rauch (01:00:24):
Yeah. There's something to be said about the fact that over time we're more and more peeking into the mind of the AI. That in itself is becoming a killer feature. So the Deepseek stream, the thinking tokens moment was a very big moment for our industry, I think. Because OpenAI did have the technology, but they decided that for competitive reasons, which, it's a reasonable think to think, no pun intended, they were going to withhold it. And also it wasn't clear that there was going to be product end user and product utility. But when Deepseek hit, it was very obvious that people really liked the idea of understanding how the AI thinks and influencing where it should go. We've gotten actually amazing feedback and bug reports where people actually specifically point out, "Look, this is where the AI went wrong. Please fix it." So the more people we get on this product, the more thumbs up, thumbs down, the more user feedback we get.

(01:01:30):
And by the way, I'll tell you for people out there building products, my number one guidance or piece of advice I would give to any startup founder was, "Create a lot of opportunities for people to give you feedback inside the product." I drew inspiration from Stripe. And this was amazing for the early days of Vercel, there was a feedback button with a very slick inline form, with four emojis that would allow you to decide how you were feeling about the feature, the product at that very moment. And that would go straight into Slack. And we were building day in and day out, just streaming users' thoughts right into our consciousness. And maybe we would get, I don't know, tens, hundreds a day, especially the early days, maybe a couple a day and whatever. When you're building AI products, it's a constant stream of user feedback. So for people that are thinking about not building AI products, it's going to be hard to compete with something that has such a tight feedback loop with users. 

(01:02:40):
The whole idea is to capture users' feedback so the next iteration of the model, the prompt, the fine-tuning, the examples, the rag is better. And one of the things that Vercel has done as a result of this insight is we've open-sourced a lot of what makes v0 work. So let's say that you wanted to create the v0 for doctors as an example. You can go to vercel.com/templates, and you can clone a ChatGPT template that basically follows all of the best practices in the world for really high-performance, awesome UIs, and now you can go out and build your own AI products. We've also open-sourced the AISDK, which is the foundational plumbing of v0. It allows you to connect any model and generate UI from its responses, not just output text, but actually generate UI. So maybe because I love showing stuff, I'll just really quickly show you this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):
Okay, cool.

Guillermo Rauch (01:03:45):
Because I'm excited about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):
Let's do it.

Guillermo Rauch (01:03:47):
So if you go to chat.vercel@ai super quick, you're going to see this is the open-source ChatGPT demo that we've built. You can ask questions like old-school LLM. But also, you can ask, let's actually finish this, let's ask, "What is the weather in San Francisco?" We call this generative UI. It's responding not with just plain text, it's creating components as a result. Last but not least, and this is a v0 style opportunity, let's ask it to help me write an essay about Silicon Valley. It's going to create a canvas or artifacts style experience, and everything is generative, but also users can edit, refine, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):
This actually reminds me of something I've been thinking about. There's all these startups that are building vertical AI tools. This is a little bit of a tangent, and there's always this AI stuff for lawyers, AI stuff for doctors, nurses, and the pitch there is that these are going to be founders that know a lot about the specific problem in this-

Guillermo Rauch (01:04:53):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:53):
... useless market, and so they'll build the tools that are very specific to them.

Guillermo Rauch (01:04:58):
Yeah, I'm absolutely convinced that expert AI tools are the future. There's an amazing product being built on Vercel called chatprd.com. It's the v0 for writing PRDs and it's going to get a v0 integration soon so that you can write your PRD with AI and then you can create it with AI. That's just an example of a vertical that you can go after. There's also OpenEvidence. It's like the ChatGPT for doctors, actually. There is an amazing startup building x-ray AI tooling. So the ideas I think are infinite, and what I've seen from users of AI at Vercel, for example, our legal team loves this tool called Get GC.AI. They could in theory go to ChatGPT to ask legal questions, but someone out there decided, "I'm going to build the best legal AI tool in the world." It's going to be up to date. I'm going to obsess about this problem." The CEO herself is a lawyer, so it's going to be hard to compete with that, I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):
But here's what I'm thinking. This is almost the opposite and I'm curious to get your take, but let's not spend too much time on this, because this is a complete change in-

Guillermo Rauch (01:06:10):
No, I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:11):
So you showed me the weather widget that you just built, basically it's like a little mini app that the AI built as you're talking to it. Is there a world where when AI, when AGI is far enough and approaching super intelligence? Can it just build you a Harvey, for example, in real time? "Here's the best experience for a lawyer. Here we go. We got it for you."

Guillermo Rauch (01:06:31):
Totally, totally. I believe that eventually, yes, but humans will always want to have some guardrails. The reality is that Get GC is taking a double job. One is making the best tools for lawyers possible, but also putting their weight behind it, saying, "We've actually used this and we believe that this is what the future should look like." There is a sense of direction and opinion about things and I think left to its own devices, AI, I don't know, this is the double-edged like prompt embellishment. AI doesn't always know exactly what we want or what we need. It's still very much a copilot, a partner, an assistant. It's not really running our lives, and I don't know that we even would want that, ultimately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:23):
Okay, I'm going to go in a whole different direction, which is taste. We hear this word taste all the time. It feels like a thing that people are always suggesting. This will continue to be an important skill, to know what is good, basically to know what people are likely to find valuable and good. And I know clearly you have great taste. You're building incredibly beautiful products, v0's clearly, it's like the most beautiful by default builder out there, as we've seen. So in terms of building taste, people are always like, "How the hell do I do that? I have great taste. I know I do. I don't need to." How have you built taste? How do you think you build taste and any advice for folks that are trying to improve their taste?

Guillermo Rauch (01:08:03):
Yes, I think it's extremely important to try lots of products. You need to get yourself out there. I think it's very important to go back to that, get into the world, ship things. Don't be hesitant of self-promotion in a way. So being very honest with yourself, building something, getting it out there, see how people react. Go back to the drawing board. I think it's about exposure. At Vercel we have one of our internal operating principles as increasing exposure hours. Try to quantify how much time you expose yourself to watching how people use your products, even to watch how people use other products, and you'll develop that muscle. Taste, sometimes I think we think of as this inaccessible thing that, "Oh, that person was born with taste." I see it as a skill that it can develop. 

(01:09:07):
And again, the AI will help you a lot here because we try and capture some of the universal principles of it. But there's also trends in the world. I'm not a super couture guy, but you can see that every year Paris Fashion Week has a theme to it and there is some innovations, there have some breakthroughs, whatever. And so trying to stay at the frontier or even try and define the frontier as well is certainly very exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:42):
I love how doable this is, increasing your exposure hours. Basically what I'm hearing is, "Use the best apps."

Guillermo Rauch (01:09:50):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:50):
There's a feedback cycle component to it. Just like, "Show people the thing."

Guillermo Rauch (01:09:54):
And understand these nuances. Right?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:54):
Mm-hmm.

Guillermo Rauch (01:09:56):
So I actually recently created, I published it to my community, [inaudible 01:10:01] v0. I created a ChatGPT style interface inspired by Grok. And I captured a few things that Grok does that are just so smart. So on mobile web, when you press enter on their input, they default to creating a new line. Because they know that the way that people are used to submitting things on mobile is not by hitting enter, like we would do on a desktop computer. You can tap the little icon and your message goes out. On desktop, they inverted it. When you press enter, you're expected to submit. And I think if you got a new line, I think a lot of people would get frustrated that most people don't know that they can press command, enter to submit and whatever, and it slows everything down. And you can basically prompt for those things.

(01:10:48):
But you have to pay attention to the details and you have to decide what you want to see in the world. And sometimes that means either defining best practices, or seeking the best practices, and learning from others. Another aspect of exposure hours is that you tend to overrate how well your products work. It's very important to give your product to another person and watch them interact with it, expose yourself to the pain of reality. And the more you submerge yourself in the real deal, nitty-gritty of what happens when people use your interfaces and whatnot, I think you you'll come out stronger, more grounded, hopefully more humbled.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:34):
We don't like pain, though, and I like that this is a push, "Create some more pain in your life. Show people the thing you're building." Do you have a heuristic or number of how many exposure hours per week, per month you want your team to have or is it just more is always better?

Guillermo Rauch (01:11:48):
Yeah, I'm more is always better. I mean, because the inertia is to get inside your head, and the inertia is to think that you know everything, and assume that everything is going good, and, "There are no errors. Of course it's fast. It worked on my machine." I think it's always a push for more. I do sometimes little things like I asked my team to color my calendar. So I say I have to have a certain amount of one-on-ones with my team represented on my calendar, kind of like meetings so that I can sync with people and see how the company's doing. Then I want to have customer meetings. And during those customer meetings I push myself to use the products. In fact, with our enterprise customers, something that I do is I try to forget how things are built, what feature of [inaudible 01:12:41] or Vercel they use and whatever. I just frequently use their products. And I want the product to be great, that's all. And then I could try to work backwards. 

(01:12:49):
So a form of exposure hours for me is seeing what kind of success our customers are having in the real world. But again, it's just heuristic. Maybe one third of my meetings this week where customer meetings I tried and watched them do. Another really quick one is we invite people frequently to demo how they use the product live, sometimes to the executive team, sometimes to the whole company. And we always inevitably discover something interesting from the customer about maybe there is something that they're in pain about that we didn't know about, or maybe something was not as intuitive as we thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:31):
And I find with these sorts of things, when you do them, when you talk to customers, you have them show how they use the product. You always like, "Why have I not done this more often? What am I thinking?" It's just so mind-blowing usually.

Guillermo Rauch (01:13:43):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:44):
I want to talk about limitations of v0 at this point. So what should people know about just what v0 can't do? If you have an existing code base, can you plug it in and start doing stuff? Or is that coming? What else should people know? Just like, "Okay, it's not going to do this yet. But- " 

Guillermo Rauch (01:13:59):
Yeah, you can import code bases through zip files and Git is coming very soon. It can do full stack development, it can connect to APIs. In the next couple of days, maybe even before this podcast is out, we'll have these very tight integrations so that if you need a database, or if you need an AI model, or if the AI decides it needs that, it'll just seamlessly install it from the Vercel marketplace. And the Vercel marketplace has already curated some of the best infrastructure products in the world to store data, to search data, et cetera. So it's going to make the product even more powerful. I'll say again, I did that exercise, and I do that exercise every day of I have a wild idea and try to see if it can come to life. It's very powerful so far. AIs are still very much a work in progress. They can make mistakes. We have it as a little disclaimer underneath the input. You will find errors, our fitness function. And we've seen such a strong correlation between user love and retention. 

(01:15:05):
v0's actually their retentive product compared to other AI products that I've built in the past, or little demos that we've done, or whatever. People subscribe and use it every single day, and are very, if they notice a bug, they're very, very jittery about it because they're depending on it day in and day out. But I'll say errors are still possible. Every once in a while you might get a runtime error or whatever, but a lot of the technology that we've added is so that v0 is very agentic. It has a lot of agency in how to act. So you're going to see very frequently that if it runs into errors, v0 tries to solve them itself.

(01:15:48):
And then last I will say, when products get really big, AI today is just not as good at dealing with massive code bases. But going back to that idea of the React component, because we break down things into files and components, we tend to do quite well in that dimension. In fact, one thing that Next.js was known for is that in order to start a project, you just create a file, and Next.js will route to that page. If anyone is familiar with PHP, it's like how PHP worked. And so it's so good that LLMs are good at working with files now, because it fits very naturally into our world. And if you can scope down when things get really big, if you can give it a smaller task, to work on a specific component or a specific file, you decrease that likelihood of the LLM not being able to reason over very, very, very long context windows.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:54):
I want to go back to design. We talked about how v0 is really good at just great design by default. To lean into that more, if someone wants to improve the design of their product, most people are not designers, they don't really know how to make it look good. They don't know what to ask for. Any just tips and best practices for making their app even better, look even nicer?

Guillermo Rauch (01:17:15):
Yeah, it was really interesting. The other day I met with a CIO of a large bank who, on the side does a lot of coding, or tries out new technologies and whatnot. And I showed him v0. And he immediately became a v0 addict. He texts me every day with feedback. He moved two websites of his own from another website builder type provider to v0 and Vercel, deployed them, gave them a domain name, they're live in production. And then he said, "Look, I have this challenge. I have this music festival that I organize with a couple of friends and this is what the designer gave us." And he had this brochure. It looked very much like a print style design. And so he gave that to v0 and the first result, he was dinging me for it. He's like, "Look, this doesn't look good."

(01:18:09):
And then, because I have experience with the tool, I said, "Why don't I just give it the feedback?" Literally you were asking me yesterday, earlier, some of the things that I've learned with the product or the best practice, what would I recommend if it were sitting next to someone? Not only, you should not hesitate to give the AI feedback, it's so interesting, dude. Sometimes people will press a feedback button to tell us what they wanted v0 to do, and literally all we had to do, in many cases is just, "Can you just tell v0 that?" And so he sent me this message saying, "Yeah, I just don't like the design." And I gave him back a prompt that I would've given. I don't know what I said specifically, but it's like, "Make it more jazzy, make it more, make it pop." 

(01:18:56):
And so trying, and again, it goes back to try to draw inspiration from variety that the AI already knows about. So in a couple of prompts, we ended up something that was in his mind, better than the original print design of that brochure, that concert lineup. And at that time, and again, I'm even learning about what v0 is capable of and the best ways to use it. But with design, I think unleashing its creativity, and seeing things, and playing with it is definitely super helpful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:35):
So one thing I'm hearing here is just tell it, "Make this look better." Or, "I don't like- "

Guillermo Rauch (01:19:40):
"Make it pop."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
"Make it pop."

Guillermo Rauch (01:19:42):
You can, totally. And if you can use tokens that are relevant, so, "Neobrutalist, minimalist, newspaper-like, vintage, make it look like a telegram." You can try and reach for things that maybe would not naturally come to mind and you'll be surprised about how well it can transfer those ideas into reality.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:09):
Incredible. Too easy. Maybe to close out our conversation, we'll see where this topic goes. I had this tweet that I loved, that I super resonate with, "The secrets of product quality is blood, sweat, and tears." I completely agree. I think that's why I think my newsletter's been successful. I spend so much time on every newsletter post, more than I think anyone spends on a newsletter post, like 10, 20, 30 hours. And that's why I think it works. Is there anything more behind that tweet, anything you've learned in just the importance of working hard, I guess to great, great stuff?

Guillermo Rauch (01:20:42):
Yeah, I mentioned exposure hours is a good example of like, "Look, it can be painful. It can be painful to see your baby break in front of everyone and noticing all the ... " The other thing is that a great product is made up of a thousand little details and so you're never really done. There's a humility that comes from the process also of why the best product builders will say nine nos for every yes. Because when you say yes, it's like adopting a puppy. A feature is like adopting a puppy. It grows into a beast that you have to take care of, and it's very demanding and loving. But also it's a lot, and poops everywhere. So you have to have a creative restraint. And while you also have to have a give, you have to withhold, sometimes with the respect of the real world complexity that emerges.

(01:21:42):
A little thing that I kind of obsess about. I'll give kudos to the Midjourney team. I really love how Midjourney works on mobile web. I don't know if they have an app yet, like a native app, but their mobile website is phenomenal. And to get it to be that good, by the way, it's possible. It's actually possible to make great things on mobile web. But it needs that sense of love, and restraint, and obsession, and testing a lot, and using your own products a lot. Dogfooding is a great mechanism, obviously. So we use the heck out of Vercel and v0 to make Vercel and v0, and hopefully that helps us do better. But there is a lot of blood, sweat, and tears in the process.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
Yeah. You can tell how much you use the product. It comes through in everything you say. Let me actually ask about this. You talked about how you said you have 600 engineers?

Guillermo Rauch (01:22:38):
No, 600 people, total and a hundred-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):
600 people total?

Guillermo Rauch (01:22:41):
... 150. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):
How is AI changing the way they work? Is there anything there? Because I feel like you guys are the cutting edge of how products are built. What's happening? Is it just everyone's on Cursor and v0 to build stuff?

Guillermo Rauch (01:22:55):
Yeah. Yes, but actually it's more profound. I think it's the, everybody can ship, it's the, we build with AI principles in mind. I actually give a shout-out to the Lumalabs engineer who said, "Well, I'll use AI for everything. I'll use AI also to generate the images for the website." And I'm seeing, for example, our designers that are working on our next conference generate all of the animations with video models. I'm looking at, our marketing team are creating demos of how the infrastructure works with v0 that are better than any static diagram or landing page that I've ever seen. One of my most viral xeets or X posts is something that one of our designers created, which explains how our compute infrastructure works with an interactive demo. And until he created that, by the way he designed, it and created, and we shipped it all in the tool, first of all, it wasn't part of his day-to-day job to do that.

(01:24:06):
v0 is making you such a powerful generalist that you can step out of your comfort zone of like, "Well, my job was to do only this." You can just create. We have a ritual every Friday, we had it this morning, called Demo Fridays. And so it's very important to create the space for people to step out of that comfort zone and use AI. So us giving permission to people to build and ship things is part of that cultural backdrop that makes these things possible. 

(01:24:42):
We had a demo today as part of the Demo Friday of our VP of sales engineering also creating an amazing tool that he's going to use to help prospects understand Vercel with v0. So I've heard from DevOps and infrastructure engineers how much they use tools like Cursor to work on the low levels of the Vercel infrastructure. So I think very quickly we're seeing AI being embedded everywhere. I just heard a product request from a customer that was saying, "Okay, Vercel, you sell domain names. Let me come up with new domain ideas with AI." So I just see a future where AI becomes synonymous with software. I do look forward to it because we need to stop talking about AI at some point. I foresee, it's probably not going to happen, but it is useful to remind people that AI equals software now, and we are a software company. We build software, and we use software to build software.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:41):
And AI is just a part of that.

Guillermo Rauch (01:25:42):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:43):
Guillermo, what a beautiful way to end it. Is there anything else you wanted to mention? Anything else that you want to leave listeners with before I let you go?

Guillermo Rauch (01:25:53):
I'll leave you with my vision of the future, which is we have this billboard in San Francisco, which is, "Everybody Can Cook." It is also part of the Ratatouille film, one of my favorite movies. I look forward to a future where everybody can get their ideas out there. If you can dream it, you can ship it. And also that when you use products and when you see the creations of other people and the things that they put out into the world, that we are collectively making the world better. So anything you experience hopefully gets faster, higher quality, fewer bugs as we go along. And I think we're all contributing to that. And I look forward to that and I look forward to everyone's feedback on how Vercel can play a part in that future.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:45):
So to build on that, where can folks find you online? Should they just go to vercel.com, visit v0.com?

Guillermo Rauch (01:26:45):
Yeah. And go to v0.dev-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:45):
.dev.

Guillermo Rauch (01:26:53):
... to get started. I did mention if you want to build your own v0, this is more advanced, but check out our templates on vercel.com/templates. And also I'm BrouchG on X, so you can DM me or tweet at me at any time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:11):
Amazing. Guillermo, thank you so much for being here.

Guillermo Rauch (01:27:13):
Thank you, Lenny. It was so fun. 

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:15):

## Transcript

Gustaf Alströmer (00:00:00):
If I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is like it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:00:30):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Gustaf Alstromer. Gustaf is a group partner at Y Combinator where he's been for almost six years. Prior to that, Gustaf was at Airbnb for over four years where he started the original Airbnb growth team and where I was very lucky to get to work alongside him for a number of years. Gustaf is also at the heart of YC's increased focus on climate tech, and in my opinion is one of a handful of people who've had an incredible impact on the increasing amount of investment and people flowing into climate tech.

(00:01:10):
We chat in depth about what's happening in climate tech, why things have shifted so much recently, what's new and exciting, and how to think about the space if you're hoping to make the jump. We also get deep into Gustaf's experience working with over 600 startups over his time at YC. We talk about what are the most common mistakes that early stage startups and founders make, what advice YC partners give founders most often, the most common attributes of successful founders, the importance of having a technical co-founder and why that's the case, so much more. I guarantee you will leave this episode smarter and more inspired and I can't wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Gustaf Alstromer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools while trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at getepo.com. Get, E-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.

Gustaf, welcome to the podcast.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:04:17):
Thank you, Lenny. Honestly, it's so great to see you. I'm excited to be talking to you.

Lenny (00:04:22):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a while ever since we booked this. We worked together at Airbnb for many years. I was really lucky to get to work with you before you moved on to bigger and better things at YC. Speaking of Airbnb, you once tweeted about how special an experience that was for you, and I think even more interestingly, how many of the people that have left Airbnb can't find another place that's as special that just like that bar has been set too high. And so my first question is just like, what do you think it was that made Airbnb so special? Why was it such an important experience for you and other people? And even more importantly, just what is it that you take from that experience that you bring to startups that you work with now?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:02):
Yeah, it's funny. I think this year in a couple of months it'll be 10 years ago since you and me started Airbnb.

Lenny (00:05:07):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:05:08):
It was 2012. The reason I treated that was I asked everyone that I'd met after Airbnb, because I had this experience of like, this was the highlight of my career up until then, at least being in the team like that and I asked everyone, "Have you found anything better?" Besides maybe one or two people, I haven't heard anybody say that they found something better. And they all missed that dearly. I thought a lot about why that was the case, but I would say Airbnb did not feel like a normal job. It felt like more like a group of friends trying to just do something together and we were friends. At least in the beginning it did not feel like this was a job. It was sort of like an ongoing project and an assembly of amazing people. I think in the end we managed to build two things, like a really successful company, thanks to Joe and Nate and Brian just for starting this. Without them there would be nothing to build.

(00:06:04):
I think people don't like to use the word family, but I feel like that way because when I go and meet with Airbnb alumnis from that team. We have a very special bond that reminds me of close social connections more than anything else. It does not remind me of coworkers. I asked myself why this was the case. The best answer I have is probably we brought in a special type of people. We had very diverse backgrounds. A lot of us was former founders. Not many of us were career people from the technology industry of the early days, not many of us.

(00:06:37):
I think that bar that we set, the first, I believe when I joined there was probably five or seven PMs and there was 30 engineers or something and you joined a little bit before me, those people set the bar or set the standard of what we were looking for afterwards. I think it took a long time to change that narrative. I mean, eventually you have to hire people that only had big corporation careers, but I don't remember we did that for a long time. When I actually read my goodbye note recently, my words there still means a lot to me and it means sort of like you're trying to reflect on exactly these things on like, building a great company that became successful and being part of this sort of family of really close friends.

Lenny (00:07:21):
So it sounds like if you had to boil down what Airbnb did, it sounds like hiring was the main piece that impacted the way it turned out just like the founders being very specific about the type of people they were hiring.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:32):
Absolutely.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Is there anything that's like, I don't know, a take away there of just what you recommend to founders, like hiring. People know, be very careful who you hire. The first, I don't know, 10 people will impact the culture long term. But I don't know. Is there anything just abstracting away there of just what to look for in that first batch of hires?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:07:50):
It's a tricky one because I would like to say that all the things that we did were the cost of the outcome of this, but that's not really how the world works. Some of the things we did work, some of the things that we did did not work. It's hard for us to actually disentangle what those things are, but I think we can talk about the things that we did. First of all, we made sure we hired people that were really excited to be there, right? They wanted to build Airbnb and they were really excited to work on Airbnb. That was the most important thing. Of course people had other offers, but I think you can figure out from those offers are you excited to be here or not. So that was probably the first thing.

(00:08:30):
The second thing I think is trying to understand the true motivations of the people that were there, like lower, "Why are you here?" We did something we call culture interviews that I think the founders have written about or there's probably content online about this. We did a lot of culture interviews early on to try to figure out we got the people that were there that mapped our core values and were really excited to work on Airbnb. I think finally, I don't know how this happened, we did pick people from diverse backgrounds. Most startups don't have most of the PMs being former founders, but I believe that was the case for the first 10 or 12 or 15 PMs at Airbnb. A lot of us were former founders. I think that that made a big difference for how you make decisions and how you get started on things.

(00:09:21):
I think I actually see this a lot in the Airbnb founders. They really care about the time at YC and they tried to recreate YC inside Airbnb a couple of times with demo day and with so new products completely isolated from the rest, starting with doing things that don't scale and talking to customers. So I think that that experience had made a big impact on them, but it's hard to say just these two things go and apply these things. It's actually kind of hard to say, "Well that will work at it as Airbnb." I think that's a really tricky question to answer.

(00:09:51):
The last thing I would say is Airbnb had an incredible business model, an incredible business from early on and it was hard to fail. What I mean by that is it's hard to fail with a company. You can fail with individual things inside the company, but a company was still going to succeed. I think we all felt that. A lot of companies don't have the ability to take risks like Airbnb did early on because they don't have something that's so obviously great.

Lenny (00:10:18):
That's a really interesting point on the last piece that you may have the most amazing culture and hire incredibly well, but if the company doesn't work out, it's not going to be looked back as like, "Wow, that was an amazing experience, but we failed."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:10:18):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:10:30):
Yeah, that's interesting. So you mentioned YC and this kind of is a good segue to where I want to focus most of our time. You mentioned that you've worked with over 600 companies at this point, which is absurd. It feels like it's you get some statistical significance on takeaways at this point of what works and doesn't work. So I have just a bunch of questions about your experience working at YC and with all these companies. The first is I think about this quote that Elad Gill tweeted once and he wrote, I think, a post about it. Elad Gill is a legendary angel investor. He said that starting a company is an act of desperation. You're either desperate to change the trajectory of your career or you're desperate to make a bunch of money, you're desperate to achieve some kind of mission or build a specific product that you're just like, "I need this to exist." I'm curious if you agree with that sentiment and then I have a follow-up question around that.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:11:20):
Yeah, actually I haven't heard it before, but you know me, I'm an optimistic person. I think it probably reflects on my view of this question, but I would say desperation sounds like a negative place that you're starting at. I actually think that most people to start companies start from a positive place. But the motivations, I agree with what he said, can be very diverse for successful founders, right?

(00:11:41):
So we actually asked this in one of the early Group Office Hours sessions. We asked them, "Why are you doing this?" And we don't want to hear an answer like, "I found this niche of the market.' That's not the why. The why is like, "Why will you come in and work late after four years when you have no money left and everything's going to shit?", right? Then the niche market is not the answer. There's something deeper than that. We've learned that it varies a lot for people's motivations to start companies. Some of them just want to solve some technical problem that they feel are passionate about solving. Some of them want to prove themselves in front of others or prove themselves towards themselves. Some have grand really important motivations to change the world and they will say things like, "I want to give everyone water or I want to solve climate change or I want to democratize publishing." You can imagine any number of large ideas. Some people just want to start a big company and just want to be successful.

(00:12:44):
It doesn't matter, in my experience, what your motivation is. I don't think either of these motivations. It sounds like some of them will be better than others. In my experience, it's not the case. The motivation will change over time to just running this thing, right? Like once something becomes big, it's hard to think every day about exactly why you got started because the motivation is just like it can be fun and work on boring things because it's fun to build something big. Everything doesn't have to be shiny and big and grandiose because there are many ideas that are "boring," but just the idea of running the company becomes the motivation eventually.

Lenny (00:13:17):
That is really interesting that one of the main things you look for, it sounds like when you're interviewing, is how strong and durable is that drive to build this company. Is that what you're saying?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:13:26):
It's actually kind of hard for screen for motivation, I would say, in interviews because the purpose of this kind of Office Hour question is to highlight why someone is there and highlight the diversity of reasons people are there and sometimes even highlight from one founder to another co-founder why they are doing this. They might have never talked about this. Actually, surprisingly, often founders have not talked about why they're doing this. And just knowing why someone is here really helps with conflict resolution for example, really helps with understanding why someone is there on a certain day or something like that. So it's not something we screen for as much as I think we try to help founders discover this among themself and really know this about themself. I've just accepted that the motivations to start companies is widely diverse.

Lenny (00:14:13):
Do you ever discourage founders from starting a company when you see that maybe it won't be a durable kind of lasting motivation or whatever other reasons just knowing how hard starting a company ends up being?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:14:23):
It's a good question. I would say sometimes if someone doesn't have a motivation or don't know why they're doing this, they're doing this because they read that it would be a natural career step. So a good reason to not start a company is if you think of starting a company as a career step. Well, it is not. Because if it's successful, it'll be your entire career. It'll be 10 years most likely. And if it's not successful, then it's not something that people generally aspire to start. So non-successful startups. So I think people will start companies because this is sort of something they want to put on their resume. They have not understood what startups are or why you should do them.

(00:14:58):
Sometimes you can screen and kind of figure this out, but sometimes people don't even know why they're starting a company when they get started and it kind of gets figured out along the way. And that's okay. I don't want to discourage people who don't know exactly why they're starting this company just to start a company. They might figure out along the way and find the true motivation after doing this for a little bit or finding that it's really fun.

(00:15:21):
I think I discourage people to start startups if they have so many other things that are important than their life that are more important than the startup. So if there are financial constraints or family constraints or relationship constraints and they are going to trump this, then yeah, you should think a second time perhaps because startups are hard. They're much harder than a normal job. Equally hard if they're successful or failure, right? There's no middle way, we're like, "Oh, my company is doing great so I can chill." That doesn't work that way either. So I don't really discourage or encourage people, I just want them to have all the information.

Lenny (00:16:03):
You mentioned YC Office Hours and I had a question around this. I'm working on this piece where I'm interviewing a bunch of B2B founders of companies that are doing super well and I asked them a few questions like, "How'd you come up with the idea? How'd you find your first few customers?" it's shocking how many of them bring up a conversation in YC Office Hours as the most pivotal point that set them on the trajectory that they're on now. I'm curious what happens in these Office Hours? What are the most common pieces of advice that you give or maybe most surprising pieces of advice that you give in these Office Hours so that people can get maybe a glimpse into these conversations you have?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:16:43):
So at YC we have two type of Office Hours, two of the common ones. We have regular Office Hours, which is usually a one-on-one or basically the founders talking to me, or me plus another partner. They happen every week or every other week throughout the entire program. And they happen years after the program on the regular basis. Then we have Group Office Hours, which is you and six or seven other startups talking to us. They have [inaudible 00:17:07] a little bit different purpose. So the goal of the regular Office Hour, I always ask the question, "What's holding you back from moving faster? We don't want to hear updates, we don't want to hear strategy questions. We want to understand what's slowing you down or what's holding you back from moving even faster. You generally have a specific goal."

(00:17:27):
And I think that question of what's slowing you down or were holding you back crystallizes the priorities. There are only so many things you can do as a startup and there are only so many things that matters at that stage. And by asking that question, we can start digging into, "Okay, what's the goal? What are the things that drives towards that goal? What are the things that's slowing you down towards that goal?" Usually, the founders don't know what's slowing it down, so the conversation and us probing questions actually leads to us or them discovering what it is just slowing them down.

(00:17:59):
In the Group Office Hour, it's a little bit different. The Group Office Hour holds a couple of different purposes. One of them is if I think back on Paul and Jessica's motivation to start YC, this is a surprise to them, but starting a company is incredibly lonely. You can't really lean on your employees and say, "Hey, I'm feeling really shitty as a founder today. Everything is going to shit." Employees isn't going to take that well. So you lean on perhaps your investors, but they're not really available. But what you can lean on is other founders because they're all in the same situation. It's sort of like when you ask a founder the question, "How are things going?", it's so emotional for them to answer that question because it's never going well, right? It's never like, "Oh, everything is going fantastic." They might say that, but everybody knows all founders, when they look each other's eyes, then no, that's not the answer.

(00:18:48):
So founders have infinite number of problems that they're thinking about all the time, which is why they're allergic to the question, "How are things going?" But when YC started, we put all the founders in a group together in a room and they started learning that all founders, all companies are broken in some way, right? They're all having these massive problems and they're all feeling that anxiety when they hear the question, "How are things going?" And just hearing other founders explain their problems, perhaps solving their problems, is a really good way for yourself to both feel motivated to do it yourself and see how problems get solved when other companies are having similar problems. Nowadays because of the scale at YC, we group companies together that have the same problems or the same area that they're operating in.

(00:19:30):
The second thing that Group Office Hours do well is accountability, right? We ask you, "What were your goals? What were your goals for the last two weeks? Did you hit them?" And then that gives founders accountability because founders are competitive. They don't want to look bad. They don't want to come back after two weeks and say "Nothing worked," or at least like, "We didn't learn anything." They want to learn something and make progress whether it's positive or negative.

(00:19:54):
Group Office Hours to me is the most magical moment because it really creates this very intense three or four month period. Founders often come back to us afterwards and say, "Hey, we want to do that again. We don't have this really intense, really productive period. We don't have a program exactly. We have other programs, but we don't have anything exactly that mimics that experience." But we do encourage founders to continue with Group Office Hours after YC. Many of them do and many of them, ad hoc, continue to meet for years in this group setting where they ask the same kind of questions to each other, to hold themselves accountable, to learn from each other, and to just have someone else to lean on. I think this was unknown and somehow the world didn't know before that starting company is super lonely and you have all these anxiety. By just talking to other people who have the same problems, it's just one of the best thing you can do.

Lenny (00:20:45):
There's so many things that come up when you talk about this. One is I had a startup at one point and we worked in the coworking space. We joined the coworking space because we're like, "Oh, we'll meet other founders. It'll be social, we won't be alone." But it turns out everyone's just heads down, headphones on, "I don't have time for anything. I just need to work." It's like a microcosm of that experience that even if you're surrounded by founders, no one has time to do anything. They're just working.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:09):
You got to schedule it and force it and put the laptops on the floor and the phones on the floor and you just sit there with pen and paper. That's how you have to do it. We tried to mimic that as much as we could over Zoom. But honestly the best experience of this was in person, in a ring, in mountain view with no computers and everyone just paying attention to everyone. That was the best experience. Yeah, that's what I remember is one of the most meaningful parts of YC. I didn't have it myself when I did YC, but now everyone has it.

Lenny (00:21:36):
The other thing that's made me think about is someone tweeted once, "Don't ever ask a founder how they're doing or how it's going. It just creates all this anxiety because nothing's ever going great."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:21:44):
Don't do it. Everybody looks at each other's eyes and they know that they're allergic to that question.

Lenny (00:21:50):
That's hilarious. So just to summarize the questions you said you asked, the one is in the individual Office Hours, is what's holding you back. And then in the group setting, what was the question again that you asked?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:01):
What are your goals for next two weeks and what were your goals for the last two weeks and did you hit the goals? And if you didn't hit them, what came in the way of hitting the goals? It's very simple. That can uncover lots of problems that other founders are having exactly in the same way. Just by talking about the things that held you back or the things that allowed you to hit your goals, uncover something material for the other seven companies doing that in the ring.

Lenny (00:22:26):
If you kind of zoomed out a little bit and thought about the startups you've worked with, what would you say are the most common mistakes that early stage startups make broadly?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:36):
There's so many. I mean, this is how I initially learned about startups, by searching for that on Google and landing on Paul Graham's articles because he kept-

Lenny (00:22:45):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:22:45):
I think I've written many articles about this topic because it is so common. So this topic can go on forever. But if I take the most recent experience I've had in YC, I would say startups fail, one, because they don't talk to customers. And if you don't talk to customers or users, you don't actually know what's important. If you don't know what's important, it doesn't matter what you build, it doesn't matter kind of what ideas you have in your head if you don't actually know what it is that you need to build and you don't validate with customers. That's where a lot of the failure stems from. A lot of early YC for us or early part of the program is us pushing and probing founders to be like, "Tell us about the conversations you've had with the customers. What did you learn? Can you show us the organizations?" Or like all these questions, like, "What are the software they're using? What are they paying for? What problems do they have? How are they describing the intensity of that problem?" So that's what we spent a lot of time early at YC.

(00:23:43):
After that, I would say one of the commons mistakes in... I'm not talking about generally startups here, I'm talking inside YC. The second most common thing I see in YC is people are just afraid to talk to customers. They're just not trying hard enough to get in front of customers. I think this comes from, technical people tend to think that software is just sort of solution to everything. But really what you should need to do is to talk to someone over Zoom or over phone or in person, even better. People are just afraid of doing that and they're afraid of being rejected. These are common, people that want to build good products are just really afraid of people saying no.

(00:24:25):
The problem is, which anyone who hasn't done sales before that joined YC, they realize this, is that if you take the average customer group in the world, 90% are not early adopters. It doesn't matter if you have something new and cool, they're just not interested. They are not incentivized to take risks in their job to try something new. They're just incentivized to not take risks and just continue what they're doing. Those 10 percents are the early adopters. They're The ones that you actually want to reach. But that means you have to reach 10 to find one. And then you convince that one person to get on the phone or a video call with you. And that takes work and it takes a lot of work. I think people don't really think of this. This is common knowledge, basic stuff for salespeople, but founders should never done sales before just get surprised by the percentages and the sort of what it means to do this.

(00:25:12):
If I think of more generally outside of YC, so these are two kind of things I experience within YC, but I think generally outside of YC, I would say the two most common problems the same one is not talking to customers, the other one is not being technical and not knowing what it takes to build successful technology company. It means having technical founders and it means being able to build the first prototype. This is something we screen for when we interview people in YC and we aren't accepting a whole lot of team that don't know how to build or get their first prototype built themselves because we know it is a super common value pattern.

(00:25:50):
I can go on and on and on and on for this one, but honestly if I drill down what makes companies fail, it's quite simple. It's just like they don't talk to users, which means they don't find product market fit. And if they don't find product market fit, nothing else really matters. What mistakes do people make is it is all about that. It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful. YC Slack headline is make things people want, and it's still true and it's always going to be true.

Lenny (00:26:23):
This is really interesting and good advice. It's interesting that... Like, "Talk to customers," people hear that all the time. They're like, "Of course we're going to talk to customers. We're going to do that of course." And your experience is they know this but they just don't do it probably because they're afraid. Maybe also because they think they already know what they need to build and it's like, "Yeah, we're good."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:26:41):
And you have all these validators, right? So the people are validating that even if you don't talk to customers, why has he accepted you? This investor invested in you. This investor said you were great, like blah blah blah. All these different validations that you confuse with product market fit, right? We have to remind everyone on the first day in YC, "None of you have product market fit because you probably don't," right? Almost nobody has. Because people confuse this external validation with the thing that matters the most, which is talking to customers and learning what matters. It's just like a thing that just keeps coming back. Some get really good at it. And that is the source of successful startups, is when you really get good at this.

Lenny (00:27:21):
It reminds me coming back to Airbnb, one of the most important moments in Airbnb history was Paul Graham telling the founders of Airbnb, "Where are your customers?" And they're like, "Oh, they're in New York" and he's like, "Why are you talking to me and not in New York right now talking to them?" And they talk about that all the time.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:27:35):
Yeah, it's absolutely true. I think he wrote the article Do Things That Don't Scale as a learning.... The learning there was the Airbnb founders doing the trips to New York and learning about how to build Airbnb, which is a very counterintuitive idea, which is when you have to spend the most amount of time with your customers. I think Airbnb is sort of one of the best stories inside YC of doing this well.

Lenny (00:27:57):
This also reminds me, I've been talking to a bunch of founders recently. I asked them, "How many customers have you talked to help figure out this idea?" So just the other day it was 150 financial CROs that they talked to before they actually started raising this round. Another company, actually two Airbnb guys that started, they actually ran ads I think on LinkedIn to find specific people to talk to and that specific role. And they talked to probably at least 100, maybe 200. So there's a strong correlation there.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:26):
Yeah, I think that's the volumes that people don't expect. They think they might have to talk to five, but I think you have to talk to 25 to 50. That means you have to reach out to a lot more to be able to get to people that are potentially early adopters. Those ones you talk to are also the ones that become your customers. So you are already doing most of the sales by just doing this work anyway.

Lenny (00:28:45):
Do you have maybe one tactical tip you could share of just either getting over your fear of talking to customers or just holding yourself accountable to actually doing it?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:28:55):
Yeah, I tell this story, I actually told this story yesterday. So remember when you sign up first service that's a cool service and you hear about in TechCrunch or something like that and then you realize you already signed up a year ago, right? And then from the founder's perspective, you sign up to something you never used it. So the founders who build those services, their inclination to think is that "Everybody hates me because they sign up and they never use me." They never use the service. The fear of that is that basically the fear of rejection. So if I put my thing out there and most people won't use it and they will tell all their friends how shitty this thing is, you should never even sign up for it, that's the fear people have, but the truth is that people sign up for it and be like, "Oh, I'm busy. I got something else to do." And they actually don't remember or care.

(00:29:43):
So whenever you sign for something that you signed up a year ago, think of yourself that that is the common customer experience, which is that you just sign up for a lot of stuff you don't even remember you. You never have this, "I hate this thing' reaction. You always have this like, "I'm indifferent to this thing. I don't actually care to even complete the sign up flow or try it out," right? I think that's the thing that people need to remember, is that the worst thing that can happen to startup is not that people hate what you're doing, it's that they're completely indifferent to what you're doing. It's not the worst thing, but the most common thing that happens is people just is indifferent. But it doesn't give you a second chance. Let's say, it always gives you a second chance and you really need to internalize that people have busy lives and if people don't actually use what you're building, that's fine. You can reach out to them a year from now or six months from now or two weeks from now and they probably will if you make some improvements.

(00:30:37):
I think people just have this fear that, "If I get a lot of rejection, that means everything is bad." But the rejection should be put in context to the early adopter idea and that most people who don't care are not early adopters, who don't want to dig into new things. And that the more narrow of a solution you have to a specific problem, the fewer people actually want to dig in. But that's where you have to start because you cannot build the whole thing right up front and make everybody loves you. That doesn't really work that way.

(00:31:07):
Even Airbnb was like air mattresses or staying in someone's homes when they're home. That was not the complete solution of Airbnb. But there were early adopters who dug in and be like, "Yep, I like that. I like those two things. I want to have people stay in my living room in my mattress." But that's not what Airbnb is about today, and a lot of those things were unknown at the time. But I think people are just afraid of rejection and you just need to overcome that fear and just learn that there's nothing that's really that bad that can happen when people don't use the service or sign up and don't care. It's not really that bad.

Lenny (00:31:42):
It reminds me of a quote that I always love for Mark Andreessen, that everyone's time is already allocated. They don't have space for your product right now. They already have plans for their day.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:31:42):
Totally.

Lenny (00:31:51):
And it takes a lot to convince someone to pay attention to anything. I guess that just comes back to why it's so important that your product is solving a real pain and not just a nice little toy that is better than what's out there, but not so much better that you're like, "I need this right now." So maybe just along those lines, do you have any thoughts on just the importance of that pain and just how critical that is?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:32:15):
I actually recorded... I'm happy of these videos, but I've recorded two videos on YouTube as part of YC Startup School last fall. You can go watch them on YouTube right now. One of them is how to talk to users and the other one is how you sell or how you use sales. The one about talking to users, I think there's a difference in asking someone, "Do you have a problem with X, Y, Z? Is this podcasting setup working for you?" And people say, "Yeah, it's kind of working." But if you are a podcasting setup experts and you watch people use some other thing that's really shitty, they might also think that it's pretty good. But you have to watch them do it. And the best way for you to figure out what is the intensity of the problem is not to ask them but to watch them or to watch them solve the thing that they do.

(00:33:06):
You know how a lot of non-technical people don't know how to automate things? So they will do the same thing in Excel like a million times by just tapping because that's the only thing that they know and they're not technical enough to write some kind of script to do it, and you just have to watch those people to just feel the pain. You can't actually ask them how difficult is it to do X, y, z because they won't even know that it's that difficult to them. So the best thing I've learned about how to discover the pain is to watch people, have them screen share, have them walk you through their daily workflow about the area where you're doing some discovery. That is the best thing.

(00:33:43):
I'll give you another example. So there's a bunch of waste companies that are doing EV charging for electric cars and they're like, "What are the problems in EV charging?" And I was like, "Just rent an EV and go and charge at all the non Tesla chargers and see what they say, see what you experience." And the truth is that it's just like garbage. A lot of EV charting systems are just so shitty and the apps are terrible. You just have to just use them yourself to know how bad it is.

Lenny (00:34:13):
It's cool how often it just comes back to, "Just go do the thing. Do things that don't scale." Classic YC advice. I want to come back to something you mentioned that I want to pull a thread on as the technical co-founder, being technical early on, just to cover that. So I know YC looks to... Having a technical founder is an important variable in you're deciding to accept a company. Say someone doesn't have a technical co-founder, do you have any advice for what they could do, like what often can work?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:34:41):
Yeah, I think the first thing is to understand the value of technical co-founder. So some people who are in this situation where they have an idea of something they want to build and they don't have anyone to help build them in building it, I had a friend Paul who gave this incredible quote, he said, "I have an idea for a song, I just need a musician to help me make it," right? That's kind of similar to how it is with engineering. If you view output of engineering as like, "I just have an idea for a song, I just need someone to actually make it for me" and then you're not valuing software engineering or mechanical engineering or any engineering skill set deep enough, right?

(00:35:17):
The truth is that the engineering part is the really hard part. The first thing I would say is you need to learn how to value the engineering piece. Let me give you an example of how you don't do that. You applied to YC and you have 90% for yourself and 10% for the engineer. You're basically saying that like, "Oh, the engineering part of this company is only worth 1/10th of me. I'm the non-technical person." So that to me is a signal that you're not really valuing engineering.

(00:35:44):
Okay, so how do you go out about and find someone? Well, the truth is that there are a lot of technical co-founders. The technical people, they also want to find business co-founders. They don't want to do other part. They don't want to do sales and they actually don't really care that much about fundraising. They just want to solve the problem. And that's fine. We built something called co-founder matching where those funders can meet, but if you don't participate in that, you can just start by asking the best technical people that you know. "Are you interested in starting a company with me?" Same thing with rejection. Many of them will just say, "No, I have a great job, I'm really happy." But some of them will have thought about starting a company for a while and was hoping that someone would come and ask them to do that. So you have to remove your fears and go and ask the best people.

(00:36:29):
The reason you want to have a technical co-founder and not a hired engineer or not a hired contracting team is because so many of the decisions you're going to make are technical and so many of the iterations you're going to make relies on engineering. And if you don't understand that, you won't actually make the right decisions anyway. It's not like service. You have an idea for a product, you build a product and you're done. There's infinite number of iterations in that process.

(00:36:54):
And then finally, I would say a lot of people learn how to code themselves, right? So there are a lot of places online that you can learn the skillset that takes to build a prototype. You might not be the best engineers. So there are many successful startup founders who are not the best engineers because they stop coding when they hire three or four engineers, that's fine. But you need to be sufficiently good that you understand the value of engineering and that you understand that the best way to solve most of the problem is with software. There are a lot of founders who just, for whatever reason, study something else that doesn't have to be a conscious or very precise reason that you had when you were 18 or 19 and then you're 25, you're like, "Oh, I wish I know how to code" and then just learn to code and they learn how to code. It's not that more difficult than that.

Lenny (00:37:42):
Have you ever seen a startup work out if they had a contracting firm, like engineering firm build a product? Does that ever work or were you just like, "No, do not ever do this"?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:37:53):
Basically, I can't recall any specific ones where people have a contracting firm but I've recalled founders where let's say you had two non-technical founders, but they valued engineering and they had an ability to build a team of great people that were not co-founders and they gave them equity and they become successful. There are many examples of that I would say, but I don't remember any specific examples where you had a contracting team building the whole thing. I think the reason for that is it takes more than just sort of riding a spec to build a product. You can't actually spec yourself to a great product. You have to just be part of the iterations yourself. That's why I think someone being the engineer, having the idea of what iteration looks like and just doing it is how you do things.

(00:38:38):
I think that the cases where I've seen non-technical founders make this work is that they have really good engineering teams who feel like they're founding team. It might not be co-founders per YC-7 definition of having 10%, but they feel like they're the bonding team.

Lenny (00:38:52):
This reminds me of a story of just the recent podcast interview I did with the CPO of Calendly. She talked about how when Calendly started, they actually had a Ukrainian dev team built the first product. Not only did they help them build the first product, they actually ended up driving all the growth initially because they saw Calendly and started using it within their firm.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:14):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:14):
And then everyone that they knew started using it and spread within Ukraine and they actually continue to work with that firm. They're still the [inaudible 00:39:20] team for Calendly or some part of it.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:22):
Wow.

Lenny (00:39:24):
Yeah

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:24):
Wow, that's cool.

Lenny (00:39:24):
There's a success story.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:39:26):
I mean, I would say it's certainly the case that in some countries people have other jobs while they start the startups, so like the engineers. In Ukraine for example or in Eastern Europe, it's very common that if they start their own startup, they actually have a full-time job as a contractor while they're starting the startup because that's how you pay the bill because often you can't raise money. And that's fine too.

Lenny (00:39:46):
Amazing. That's some hustle.

(00:39:49):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time-consuming, subjective, biased, and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management, including a continuous employee-centric approach so employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time, and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando, managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(00:40:47):
I want to zoom out a little bit and ask another big question and see what answer you have for this. If you just think about the most successful startups in YC or even just the companies you worked with, if you had to pick just one or two attributes of what's most common across successful companies, what would that be?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:41:04):
I would say the most common reason that I've seen founders succeed or companies succeed, it comes down to the founders and characteristics of those individuals. The most important characteristics of those individuals are they're really determined to win and they don't give up when things are hard and they have an internal motivation that's just really infectious to people around them, which is how they end up building really good teams around them. People are actually going to want to go and work for them. I have numerous examples of people like this where the CEO or one of the founders are just really inspirational people.

(00:41:42):
The second thing I would say is they are technical. So that's kind of like they're technical enough. If I would grade companies on a scale of technical to less technical, more technical founders are more likely to succeed, I would say. And then I would say they figure out how to talk to users and move fast early on so they don't wait for permission from their investors or from YC or from someone else to make progress. They're like, every day or every week there's continuous progress. They're not doing this for someone else, they're doing this for the customers. They're not doing this for the investors, that's for sure. The investors are sort of in the way more or less. And they're just naturally focusing on the customers.

(00:42:29):
Finally, what I would say is the skill that's really attributed to great founders is excellent communication skills. So the ability to communicate really complicated ideas clearly, to enjoy the communication part, right? Enjoying communication is often kind of correlated with enjoying doing fundraising, which is an important part of some companies' success. Not all of them, but for some of them. I would say communication or storytelling is part of the same arc, right? And those are part of the same thing that actually motivates people around you. If you can communicate why you're building, what you're building and why it's important to the world, tell a story about that, that can motivate people around you to just want to follow you. I think it's rare that I've seen founders succeed where the founder isn't in some way an inspirational person or someone that is a good communicator. Most of the time, you at least have respect or you somewhere know that they're going to succeed, right? And that is what inspires you to be around them or be on their team.

Lenny (00:43:33):
That is a really cool list. So just to summarize, one, they have the strong will to win, and with that they're inspirational. They kind of pull people along and get people really excited. Two is they're more likely to succeed if they're technical and can build a thing. Three, they figure out how to talk to customers, don't wait, just start doing it. And they're just obsessed with that versus what investors want them to do and they don't want to talk to the investors to make time for the customers. And then excellent communication skills, which comes back to the first. They're able to story tell and get people excited. Is that right?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:44:06):
Yeah, I would say those are the attributes of successful things. To be a super successful company, there's something else that have to happen. Those things are not things you can put on a list because they are the outliers, right? If you look at startups on a typical YC batch, there'd be a couple billion companies. Those are the outliers. They'll almost certainly have all the things that we've talked about. Many other companies in the batch will have that too, but then what makes someone a true outlier is something that is unknown. That's why so many investors said no to Airbnb when they were not trying to raise money because that was an outlier idea. It was an idea that was not logical and did not make sense to most people. Those kind of ideas, the ones that end up succeeding often don't make sense to people. There's some reason that no one has done this before because they're just not natural next step of the world.

Lenny (00:44:57):
That's a great segue to a question I've been meaning to ask, which is, how good are you at predicting in a batch which startups are going to be the monster hits? So maybe like you and then just generally YC, how good are you all at knowing what's going to work out, is going to be the next Airbnb or Dropbox?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:45:14):
I think the truth is that we're not very good at knowing what's going to succeed. Certainly we cannot figure out who's going to be the really successful company in the batch. That's not possible. What we're good at is knowing what failure looks like. What we sometimes like to tell founders at the beginning of the batch is like, "If you fail, please do it in some new exciting way. Not one that we've seen 100 times." Because we have seen people fail for a large number of reasons. The best way for us to sort of not predict, but the best way for us to make more companies succeed is to tell them how they might fail, right? Be very direct and honest with them and say, "You doing these three things, these things are likely going to lead that you won't succeed." And if we do our job well, most people get that feedback and they're on the track for succeeding.

(00:46:06):
Now, which of those companies end up becoming the best? There are so many things that are uncorrelated to being the best, and it's the things that people don't like. I'm in a hot industry, I was writing up on TechCrunch like, this investor started talking to me. You'd be surprised how many of the things I just mentioned are uncorrelated to outlier success, right? That's why it's so hard to actually do this. I think people really want these questions to be answered. People really want to believe that you can pick really great companies at the seed stage, but everything I've learned from the plus 600 companies that I've worked with is that it's just not that easy and it's maybe not even possible and certainly not possible when you talk about finding the outlier companies. I don't think it's that easy. And if it was easy, then we would accept a lot fewer companies. We just accept those ones, but it's just not that easy.

Lenny (00:46:59):
Do you have a sense of which ones are likely to work out better than others? Or is it just like, "We have 150 really unclear, but one of these, hopefully."

Gustaf Alströmer (00:47:09):
One good indicator is if each new Office Hour there is really exciting new stuff, right? We're not talking about the same thing we talked about two weeks ago or four weeks ago. They've already done that stuff, right? Like, "Oh, I was trying to sell to these three customers. Well, they already bought it. I'm not actually talking to seven others." And now we are talking about a different price and different product because they're like, they want more of what we're doing. If I'm experiencing that, and that's like a consistent trend, then when people draw this revenue graph of this 10% weekly growth rate kind of situation, those are the companies that we attribute that to. It's like if you're able to make that progress on that short amount of timescale, you are on track to do something well.

(00:47:51):
Now, a lot of other things have to go well for you to ultimately be able to succeed, but progress on this weekly or biweekly timescale is a really good indicator of someone who'll succeed. To me, much better indicator than I am in this market or I'm talking to this investor or something like that. But those are much worse indicators of someone succeeding than I'm making progress and it's pretty fast clip.

Lenny (00:48:17):
Interesting. And so what I'm hearing is at the beginning of a batch, we're just in a bet on a bunch of companies that have a lot of potential founders, technical maybe, they have the strong will to win and all these things. Through the batch, you're looking at the companies that are exceeding your expectations week to week in terms of progress that they're making.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:48:34):
I mean, sometimes it could be different reasons that people are not making progress. But if you are making continuous progress, and I think Paul and Jessica said this, this was true early days in YC, if you are hitting your goals and you're making progress continuously, if that continues, that's a really strong correlation to some success. But again, going back to the question, can we predict who's going to be the best ones? No. And that's why we really focus on trying to meet people not to fail. Especially good teams can't fail. If you have a really talented team who's really technical in how to build a product but they make some other basic mistakes, like not talking to customers or something like that or trying to build everything all at once, I feel like it's our responsibility to make sure they don't make the basics mistakes that we've seen many times. We need to help them at least make some spectacular mistake that we haven't seen before. Then that's a high potential team. If someone's on a good track for a decent idea but they're still early, that's a really good potential.

Lenny (00:49:30):
I have kind of a fun question that I wanted to try, which is kind of connected to this idea around attributes of successful founders and companies. So I had this founder friend named Flow, and he was asking me recently, "If you had to think about the most successful founders, which attributes do they have?" And he kind of gave me this list and it's kind of like two ends of a spectrum. So I thought it'd be fun to just go through this list and see, in your experience, which end of the spectrum, if any, are associated and correlated with the most successful founders. Does that sound good?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:50:01):
Sure. Sure. Let's do it.

Lenny (00:50:03):
Okay. So the first is speed versus quality. Is there end of the spectrum where you find that most successful founders are either speed-focused or quality-focused?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:50:10):
Sometimes founders ask us this question, "What should I focus on? Growth or retention?" And the answer is, they're asking us for permission to not do one or the other. The truth is, to succeed, you have to do both. I would argue that speed versus quality, there's different level of speed and different level of quality at different stage of the company. But the truth is that you always have to move fast and you have to understand what the meaning of quality is, right?

(00:50:35):
So I think I actually don't see that as a spectrum, but I would say if you move fast with talking to customers, you'll build something that have potential having quality because you know a lot about the problem. I think when people think about quality, they often think about, "What is my personal definition of quality?" I have a bar of quality, but quality to me of a good product idea, a good startup idea, has more to do with the customer think is valuable. And if you move fast by talking to customers and having customer learnings and know the problems, then you will actually come up with something that's high quality. So they're not at a spectrum to me.

Lenny (00:51:11):
All right. Let's try another one. Confidence versus humility as a founder?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:51:16):
I don't think that they're on a spectrum. I think that learning to predict confidence as a founder is critical going back to this communication piece of motivating people around you, right? I wouldn't want to join a company where the founder's completely not confident in their own idea, right? Because that is going to shine through. An investor isn't going to want to invest in someone who's completely not confident in that idea. So learning to first build your own confidence for what you're working on and then predicting that confidence to the people around you I think is critical. A lot of people will have doubt around you. And if you're not predicting that confidence, it's not clear that anybody else will if you're the founder. You're the one who's have to do it.

(00:51:58):
I think that you can predict that confidence while having a strong sense of humility towards the people around you. But I think when it comes to startups, learning to have that confidence is an important piece of the early days, right? And especially if you're building something that's very difficult, that takes a lot of work and a lot of money, protecting the confidence that you will succeed is critical for everybody that's doubting you. And those doubting you is a lot of people around you, right? And you just need to have an unnatural amount of confidence to prove them wrong. I think, again, this is not on the spectrum with humility. In fact, the most successful founders are often the most... You cannot inspire people around you if you don't have a strong sense of humility. People don't actually want to spend time with you, which means they don't want to work for you or invest in you. Again, you need both, but they serve different purposes when you get started.

Lenny (00:52:48):
Tough gig this founder life. You got to got to be everything. Let's see if there's a big difference in this next one. Execution and tactics versus focusing on strategy and kind of higher level stuff. How deep do founders go that you find that are most successful?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:53:02):
So this one actually I have a strong opinion about. I think that the reason that we talk about strategy a lot is because it goes back to business school. The origin of business school was to teach people to join the corporate world. And in the corporate world, strategy matters, right? So when you join a big company, you're employee number 2,010 or something, then you probably might have a business school job where thinking about corporate strategy is an important thing. When you are a small startup, strategy does not matter because there's not that much a strategy as about. Maybe later on you might be fruitful to think about strategy, but strategy kind of assumes that you can do multiple things at the same time, which small startups cannot. They can just do one thing at the same time. So execution is the thing that matters for companies.

(00:53:51):
Whenever someone wants to have a strategy conversation, it assumes that they don't understand their priorities. The priorities is always a list from top to bottom where there's one thing that's more important than the others. You can't really have a strategy session about the other things because there's only one thing to work on. So to me, a clear answer here is the good founders are execution-oriented and they just continually have one priority of what they're trying to go for. And then they're just hitting that priority all the time and then new priorities will come up and you don't really have time to have a discussion about company strategy. Company strategy also assumes that you have product market fit because you already have something that's working. If you don't have that, then getting to people wanting your product, that is your strategy. You don't have any other strategy.

Lenny (00:54:36):
Awesome. Okay. We found one that's quite different one on the spectrum or the other. How about autocratic and kind of like, I don't know, I think of Steve Jobs-like versus kind of consensus, collaborative driven, if this is a spectrum at all. And then where do you find founders might fit that are most successful?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:54:53):
I don't know if I have an answer to that question because I think when you work at early stage, you might look different than when you work at late stage. I don't spend a lot of time with founders that have thousands of employees and hearing how they are in the... When I talk to those founders, I talk to them one-one-one and I only hear from their perspective. So I don't actually know how they're peering in a large corporate setting. But when you're a small company, you're three people or five people or 10 people, you cannot be an autocratic decision maker. The founding team have a founding team decision making dynamic that could look different. Sometimes it's like everybody decides together on everything and sometimes you say, "I have my area of expertise and you have yours. We split it up, the decision making." Either of those things are fine. I think you just have to have a process so you don't rehash every decision after you made them a million times.

(00:55:42):
I would say the thing that matters the most at that point is to be willing to adhere to the process that you and your founding team have come up with. Your individual nature could be different in a different role in a different company. But for a startup to work out, you have to have a specific process on how you make decisions. Those are on a very short sprints, like weekly or biweekly. And everyone needs to feel good about decisions after the fact. At least they feel good about the process. I don't think that you can just decide... You can't also be fully collaborative, everyone gets decided about everything. So small startups agree on how they decide together. So after that, everyone just follow the process. That's usually how things work out.

Lenny (00:56:27):
Okay, I got one more. Cares more about the product or cares more about the distribution and growth strategy?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:56:33):
Well, there's a lot of assumptions built into that, I would say, because caring about the product to me is caring about the customers. Sometimes if I would say something like, "Oh, great founders care about the product," a lot of founders misinterpret that as in my personal perception of the product or my ideas of what the product is. And that's wrong. The right perception there is the expectations or the use of the product from the customers. So if you are meaning focus on the product or cares about the product in that sense that your customers care about, then absolutely, I think that's a really, really critical, important thing to have early on, like talking to users, doing things you don't scale. Once you get big, if you don't figure out a scalable distribution strategy, you won't succeed. And those are different for different companies, but they're not doing anything that don't scale.

(00:57:27):
Doing things that don't scale is not a scalable strategy. Eventually, something specific will be the things that work for you. If you're lucky, people will talk about your product and you'll have organic growth. But in many cases, that sales, that is some kind of consumer distribution strategy. You can't start with that. I've seen a lot, and this is when I had to reset my thinking coming from a growth team joining YC, is you can't start a startup ethic with a growth team mindset because that is just scalable things all the time. And really what you need to go back to is doing things that don't scale and unscale your way of thinking about customers. But it's really useful to have the growth mindset once something is working, right? Once you have thousands of people signing up everything every day, well how do you get to 2,000? Well, that's probably something that looks more like this thing that the growth team would do or distribution team would do.

(00:58:21):
I would say everyone has different experiences of this based on their prior experience, right? So if you work for a company that was infinitely successful, then you won't care so much about this. If you work for Google, you'll never even think about this because distribution is just the website. But if you work for a really small shitty product, then you think a lot about distribution because that's natural to you on how you succeed. So I think at the end of the day, talking to customers matters the most. That is what it means to care about a product to me. And then distribution is something that you will definitely invest a lot in once something is working.

Lenny (00:58:53):
Awesome. All right. I have probably a hundred other questions I want to ask along these lines, but I want to make sure we get to another topic which I know is near and dear to your heart, which is climate tech. So my understanding is you're instrumental in pushing YC to focus on climate tech as a focus area. I believe you led the charge on their initial request for startups I think is the term where you all put out like, "Here's who we want to fund." I think you've mentioned you funded a couple dozen climate tech companies and the last few batches, is that all generally correct?

Gustaf Alströmer (00:59:24):
First, request for startup was actually Sam Altman and a few other folks that was kind of that one who drove that. The second one that we wrote into our actual request for startup, I wrote that one, was carbon removal specifically focused on. And then naturally the people that apply with climate tech ideas get in my reading queue of applications and I read them and I interview them. Not all of them, but many of them. I think today we funded over 130 plus companies that are focused on climate tech in some way or another.

Lenny (00:59:53):
Wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (00:59:54):
The trend line is that really ambitious people who want to start companies in this area. Some of them want to start the companies because the climate tech is the number one problem, but they don't view this as a nonprofit. Now I want to really make this as a distinction. People somehow think that starting a climate tech company is doing good for the world, but it probably doesn't have a lot more than that. The truth is that the world have decided. Because climate is one of the biggest problems that we're facing, if not the biggest, we've decided that we are going to stop doing the things that we're doing and we're going to change our entire energy system and change all the things that we do that emits carbon. And we have just decided, governments have decided this. The question is how it's going to happen, but this decision has been made.

(01:00:42):
In that transition, we're talking about trillions of dollars of money moving from things that cause climate change to things that don't. The scale of this transition is not something we've seen recently. Like software is not that big in comparison. It actually is much smaller than this transition. So I think if you look at something like Tesla, which now has, I don't know, $600, $700 billion market cap, that's just one company that currently provides a couple percent of all the cars in the United States, new cars sold. And that is already one of the biggest companies in the world and has now the biggest, richest person in the world. We've only seen the beginning of this. The economical motivation be behind the decisions that people are making are just as strong as I want to fix climate change because this is just a really good business. This change have attracted a large set of software founders that you and me know that listen to this podcast that said, "My skills is relevant here. There are a lot of things that I can do. And if not, I can learn those things."

(01:01:43):
But most importantly, the skills of working for startups is really, really critical to join this transition. A lot of them have started companies or joining companies. I still get an email every week from some accomplished software engineer who asked me "Which software companies should I work for to fix climate change?" And I've gotten those emails for two or three years now. This thing just attracts really, really ambitious people. It's not stopping. It's accelerating. I feel lucky to work with so many of these great founders because they are uniquely interesting people.

Lenny (01:02:16):
I've noticed exactly the same thing of just how many smart, driven, amazing people are like, "I just want to move to a climate tech company. That's all I'm looking for now." Just to give you credit, I feel like you are ahead of the curve on the shift that's started to happen and pushed YC to focus on this really early. I always think like, "Man, I know Gustaf and I feel like Gustaf has made such a massive impact on the investment and focus in startups on climate." And so I just want to give you huge props for doing that and being so at the forefront of a lot of this.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:02:50):
Thank you. I mean, sometimes I'd say that it matters to someone who has the credibility of YC to start accepting these companies. It does matter. I remember when I spoke to Diego from Pachama in 2018 when he was starting Pachama, we were whiteboarding in YC. He was a YC alumni starting a different company. The word climate tech did not exist. People were unsure if investors would fund companies like these. Pachama's raised $60 million to have, I don't know, lots of big customers, lots of employees and it's clearly doing really well. But I think at the time of 2018 it was kind of unknown. One of the reasons it was unknown is we had this previous bubble, clean tech bubble, in 2008, 2009, 2010 that didn't work out because of a number of specific reasons and investors were just afraid of funding things because they had some scar tissue or scars from this previous thing that happened.

(01:03:46):
Now that turned out upside down. The number of new investors that are investing in climate tech is as big of a trend as any other trend we've seen in the last decade or two decades. There's just an enormous focus on the investing side. Most recently, me and another guy, David Rusenko, wrote this request for startup, a new updated, very detailed list of... I hope we can post it in the show notes, a very detailed list of ideas or areas where we think it might be worth looking If you want to start a company.

(01:04:18):
Now, we don't know what good ideas look like. We don't know. But we can tell you where all the areas of opportunity exist. We should go and look for good ideas. We wrote this because in response to all these people that come to us and say, "I want to work on climate tech. I don't have a good idea because I don't have any specific experience in this stuff." And then we're just like, "Don't work on these three things but go and work on any of these 25 directions." It already has generate a good response. I think it'll generate more response. But I think it's important for YC to tell the world that we look and fund these things. And that's always been the reasons we had requests for startups, is to let people know that these are things that we actually want to fund.

Lenny (01:04:58):
I actually moderated a panel a couple weeks ago. This organization called the Climate Draft put together PMs that are in climate tech. A lot of the questions were just like, "What kind of background do I need to move into climate tech startup to start a climate tech company?" It's interesting, every single one again and again just said like, "Your actual regular PM skills is all we need." There's a lot of people already at the company that are experts in the science and that's okay if you have no experience. They just need the business experience, how to operate, how to execute, standard stuff that PMs learn. And so would you agree with that that you don't need to have this deep background in science and climate to move into the space?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:05:41):
Yeah, I would say if you were working on a software company and even some of the hardware companies, that's probably generally true. Absolutely. It's much more valuable to have that background than to have this specific domain expertise background. Those are complimentary. But as a PM, having the solid PM background is the more valuable piece I would say. Being a competitive PM, coming from a really good culture of product management, knowing what good looks like, that's invaluable to some of these companies because in the past they weren't able to hire these people. So I agree with that 100%.

(01:06:14):
In terms of founders, I've seen everything, right? I've seen people having some domain expertise starting a company and really succeeding. I've seen people who had no domain expertise and learned everything they need to know. Maybe they partnered up with someone who had a domain expertise and then succeeded. I've seen all of it and I actually think that you can succeed in either of these categories. You don't need the deep expertise. It depends really on all the area you're in. But someone like Pachama, Diego and Tomas did not have expertise in forests besides the personal experience. They just had a willingness to solve the problem and it really worked out for them.

Lenny (01:06:51):
You mentioned you have this list of areas you're excited about. I know we'll share in the show notes, but is there any you want to highlight, just like here's areas you're most excited about and want to fund and/or are there companies you want to mention that are super interesting and super cool in the space that people should know about?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:07:04):
We wrote the list and we are highlighting companies in each of the categories. I don't know if I want to highlight any specific categories, but I can talk about some of the things that we've funded in the past that has real legs. So here's how I generally think about climate tech. So we have to decarbonize all the things we do that emits emissions. That means we have to change a bunch of things in the world, change transportation, change energy, change homes, all of these things, or change how we heat homes for example.

(01:07:35):
And then there is carbon removal. Carbon removal is sort of like, well even if we do all of this stuff really well, it's probably not going to be enough. And because there's an opportunity and there's some evidence to suggests that we can actually remove carbon from atmosphere in some way or another, a lot of companies are also working on this at the same time. I would say we need to do both and they're not in conflict. We probably are going to need to do both. Well, we certainly need to do the first one.

(01:08:02):
On the decarbonization side, there's infinite number of categories of our society where we met a lot of carbon, right? So I'll give you an example. Shipping is a really big deal. A lot of carbon emissions come from freight ships around the world. That's not obvious solution how you would solve that because the kind of oil that they run on is really cheap and it's a very low margin business and they don't have a whole lot of incentives to change besides what is coming down regulatory. So it's not a national solution where someone to be a cool, someone will build a test off ships and it just work out. But the two companies to be funded in that area, one of them is Seabound who is building carbon capture and removal for ships.

(01:08:41):
The other one is Fleetzero who build electrical ships. Electrification is on and again and again and again and again and whenever it's being applied, turn out to be a more efficient way of doing whatever thing that you were previous doing with the combustion industry. It is almost no maintenance. It's cheaper to build. The batteries are more expensive, it's cleaner and it fits the carbon coal you have. There's just a bunch of benefits there, but there has limitations. Usually the limitations on electrification has to do with batteries. It's like how far can you go? Now that category is what I call the... Which is a very important kind of critical one, which is the carbon accounting and sort of the recommendation systems that help big company account for the carbon that they have and they are giving some recommendations of what you do.

(01:09:25):
So I'll give you three examples. We funded Unravel Carbon, which is carbon counting software in Singapore, focusing on Asia, probably the leading one there. There's company called Carbon Chain, which is focused specifically on supply chain and shipping and raw materials, stuff like that out of UK. And then there's ANAI here in the Bay area. Who knows how this market is going to play out, but this market has carbon accounting customer demand right now, right? So all the large companies of the world have other either promised the government, promised their shareholders or promised the public, or maybe even the employees, they go into decarbonize. They don't always have an idea how to do it. These software platforms is like the plug and play "This is how you do it."

(01:10:07):
And then I'll give you two examples of things you can go into if you don't have any specific domain expertise and just a good software engineer. There's a company called Enode. They are basically building Plaid for EV chargers and Plaid for home energy system. So if we imagine that the future of all homes or future of all charging of EVs is going to be a bunch of energy appliances that are run by small computers, they're all wifi connected, you can connect to them and do things, tell them to turn on, turn off, turn on when it's cheap, turn off when it's whatever, all these different things that are valuable for the energy grid. Then you need a software platform to connect with all of them. And that's what Enode has been building.

(01:10:48):
Another related company is called Static. Static is the Airbnb for EV charging in India. The reason that you need something like that is you don't have Tesla charging. You don't really have public charting in general. People don't have outlets in their garage and they don't have garages. So you need to build a new bottom up EV charging system or platform, and that's what Static has been doing. They're actually building out public charging infrastructure as well, but they have their own app. So if you use a Static app, they'll direct you to all the Static chargers. I believe that they're the biggest or the fastest growing EV charging network in India, which is the second-biggest country, if not the biggest country in the world right now.

(01:11:25):
So the potential of these ideas, even that they're doing well now is just infinite, such an enormous market. If you succeed in one of these things, I don't think we are going to have as many gas stations as we have today and different networks. We're not going to have the same in EV charging. It's going to be a lot more consolidated around the use experience of the end user and the app they open to do this stuff. So I'm pretty convinced that there's real big opportunities for software entrepreneurs to figure this out. There's some companies in the current batch that are focused on this too.

(01:11:59):
The final one I would mention is Heart Aerospace. We have a Heart Aerospace and the Right Electric and a few others focused on aviation. Aviation is another big difficult to decarbonize. Heart and Right are focusing on battery electric planes. So they're basically making commercial airplanes that fly on batteries and flying electric motors and it's incredible to see.

Lenny (01:12:22):
What a killer list. We're definitely going to include links to all these companies in the show notes. Something I was thinking about is, so one narrative violation you mentioned is that there's actually money to be made in climate tech. It's not impact-oriented market anymore. It might be worth chatting about why that happened, but the question I want to get to is also things are going well. A lot of progress is being made. People see climate change and it's like we're dead, it's game over. But it feels like battery prices are coming down, solar's coming down, wind powers ramping up, all these startups are investing. So it'd be fun to just hear what's going well and maybe what is there to be optimistic about, but then also, "Okay, yeah, things are going well, but there's still things that are not going so great and where we need to double down."

Gustaf Alströmer (01:13:10):
Two specific things that went well in the last say 12 or 24 months. First one was politics. So in the United States we got the IRA, which is like it's called the Inflation Reduction Act. It makes sense because shift into greener energy is going to actually reduce inflation because it reduces energy costs. But it's really a climate bill, right? It really is a bill that is focusing on onshoring, a lot of supply chain for the green economy and incentivizing a lot of this change that we just talked about. Whether it's carbon removal or home energy or home heating, whatever it might be, this bill addresses all of it and is massive. So that's one really good news. Politics didn't have a lot of good news in the US for a long time on this. Maybe not ever actually.

(01:13:52):
The second good news, and it's such a good news that Europe is now trying to conquer. They're not trying to counter the IRA with their bill because they're seeing some of the battery companies saying, "Well, I'll actually going to build the next factor in US, not Europe anymore. I changed my mind."

Lenny (01:14:05):
Oh, wow.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:14:05):
So Europe now has to counter with their incentives as well. The second good news is corporations are now customers. So maybe three or four years ago you went to a Fortune 100 company and you're like, "Hey, do you want to buy my XYZ decarbonation solution?" What it's like? The software platform or EVs or whatever it might be. They're like, "Well, talk to this person on this floor. Maybe they can help you." And this person was not really empowered to make decisions. That has changed. Now they're like, "Actually, we promised our shareholders to reduce emissions by 2% every year and we also promised the government and we promised whatever publicly to do that. So we got to do that." They're like, "Where do we start? What's the first 2% that we got to decarbonize? Maybe that starts with energy. Oh, we'll change our energy providers." But they are now showing up as customers, not just with LOIs but paying actual for contracts, right? Doing investments in these companies because they've all see the future and they don't want to be behind.

(01:15:02):
There's financials motivations for this. They want to get access to capital that has some strings attached to some of these things, but they don't want to fall behind. And then they don't want to be the Toyota to Tesla, where Toyota said, "We are not going to do battery electric." It's just like they're still saying that sometimes and everybody else is like, "Tesla is the one we got to copy because that's the one that's winning." All these corporations are really afraid of being the Toyota. They're really afraid of being the last one who's not changing and then the world will move past them and then they're going to die. So I think the motivation here is intrinsically survival and it's really about sort of adopting this because this is where the world is going.

(01:15:39):
I think these are the two best news. The thing that I think what... We also wrote about this in the request for startups. This is not a thing where you can convince everybody to just agree with you. And even if you did, people wouldn't know what to do. So you have to view this as an economical opportunity and say... We can't convince everybody that this is going to be the thing that's going to happen. It doesn't actually matter if you convince everybody. What matters is that sufficient amount of corporations are convinced that they change their habits. And then you can sell the things you're building to them.

(01:16:09):
As sort of founder, just focus on your customers and focus on B2B. That's what most people I recommend to do here because that's where most of the change is going to happen. That's why I'm really optimistic about these startups and these founders. What they're doing is, in my opinion, more impactful than someone running a campaign trying to convince some other people that this is a big problem. Even when people know that climate change is problem, they don't know exactly what to do about it. But the startup founders, they know.

Lenny (01:16:37):
You touched on this, but it feels like one of the biggest shifts is capitalism is kicked in and is now leaning into climate tech startups and that's-

Gustaf Alströmer (01:16:46):
Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Lenny (01:16:48):
... making a big dent. Well, with that, we've reached the final part of our chat, which is the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:16:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:16:59):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:17:04):
The first one I recommend, I think I have it here. Yeah, this one. It's called The 100% Solution. It's written by Solomon Goldstein-Rose. It's for people who think climate change is a problem but don't know what to do about it, or they're just kind of in despair or think they're like, "Ah, everyone are going to die," right? There are some books written where the outcome of the book is like, "We're all going to die," but the truth is that we're not all going to die. This book is trying to cover the 100% of all the solutions in detail, kind of much more detailed version of the request of Sharp that we wrote. It gets you freely optimistic. And I give that to anybody who's cared about climate change because it really lays out this from a very optimistic way of looking at the world. And that's why I recommend that book more than almost anything else. That's probably my number one book.

Lenny (01:18:00):
Amazing. I love that if just a one book, here's the book you got to read. I like that approach. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:18:10):
Oh, I watched so much. I don't know. I love Emily in Paris on Netflix. I think I have TV serves different purpose for me these days. It's just like entertainment.

Lenny (01:18:22):
Yeah, I get that.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:18:24):
But what else movie do I watch? We watch the Everything All at Once. I thought that was a really good movie. That was-

Lenny (01:18:30):
Yeah, it might win Best Picture.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:18:32):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:18:32):
We have a drinking game here. People say White Lotus, we drink. And so you did not, that's probably for the best. Favorite interview question that you like to ask YC founders when you're interviewing them?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:18:43):
What have you done since you applied to YC on your product? What are specific things that you've accomplished since you applied? Because that usually is a month or two month months ago.

Lenny (01:18:51):
That's awesome. It connects so much with what you said earlier.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:18:55):
I hope the answer is like, "Here are all the things that we did."

Lenny (01:18:59):
Versus we just prepared for this interview.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:19:01):
Exactly. Exactly.

Lenny (01:19:02):
Most out there wild startup you have funded?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:19:07):
I think I would say when I stepped onto the hangar floor of Heart Aerospace. I can send you a photo. Literally, I am looking at an airplane that's being made and I'm like there's no SaaS company's office you can walk into and you just open your mouth and you're like, "What the hell is this?" There are a few of those companies that are space companies or airspace companies or something like that where it's just a different feeling that you fund them and you can touch it. I have a lot of appreciation for things like that now because they're much harder to do, but when you succeed, they're much more tangible and you can be like, "I have a tiny little piece in this space rocket or this airplane that we funded or this satellite above us." I really think that that's in some way a strong legacy compared to some other things that exist and just replace other softwares. And all these are better businesses, but there are strong legacies.

Lenny (01:20:06):
What's a pro tip for applying to YC?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:20:09):
Pro tip. Number one thing is go to YouTube and type in like... I think there's a video that we've recorded which is about how you succeed with your application [inaudible 01:20:18]. It's an hour long video that gives you all the pro tips on how to do it. We told people in advance, "Once you've watched that video, then see if you know anybody who've done YC and then reach out to them and maybe ask them if YC is right for you, but also ask them what's important for you to, as you kind of approaching applying to YC, writing the application, during the interview, what were the things that matter?" Those are probably the two things I would do.

Lenny (01:20:46):
Final question, what's one pro tip for visiting Sweden?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:20:49):
First of all, you should visit in the summer. It's a really good time to be there. It's a very different country in the winter. Try to go outside the cities into the nature and then prepare yourself for Swedes not all being Americans. They're a little bit more colder and have a little bit more distance to you and they don't randomly talk to you like I've learned to do here in America. I think you just have to go along with a little bit different of a vibe than you have here in the US. Most people actually love it. Most people who have just been, they love it, but most of them go in the summer.

Lenny (01:21:23):
This reminds me, I wanted to close it, but there's a tweet once about how in Sweden when you go to someone's house, they don't feed you. It's not expected that you will have food. You have to bring your own food. Is that true? And what's that about?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:21:35):
It's absolutely true. I actually gave an unconference talk about this topic. The unconference talk was all of the strange things to Swedish people do and why. If i would summarize it, yes, we do that. I actually experienced that. I went to a friend's house and they had dinner and I waited in my friend's room while they had dinner. That was just normal. And why did that happen? I think there's a strong sense of individual responsibility in Sweden, which kind of reaches over to unfriendliness, [inaudible 01:22:10] from an American or foreign lens because this is so crazy. But in Sweden it's just like, "Well, you take care of your kids. I'll take care of my kids." And it's not really a question.

(01:22:18):
I think that a lot of the motivations of why Swedes are strange, one of them is we don't want to be indebted to someone else. So we never want to feel like... Which is why you wouldn't... For example, if you go to a bar in Sweden, you don't buy a round, you buy your own beer because maybe you have to figure out the money at the end of the day, things like that. I think it's just actually quite individualistic society, but it's individualistic with heart I would say. There's a warmth to it, but it will definitely be appeared strange to people who don't really understand this. They think people are cold and they're just like they don't understand that there's actually a heart behind this stuff.

Lenny (01:23:00):
That sounds really smart, to be honest, the system. I would be into it, but I can see how people are very confused. Gustaf, I can't thank you enough for doing this. This was incredible. I know that people listening to this are going to leave informed, inspired, motivated, hopefully motivated to move faster and make more progress. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more or ask you may be follow up questions? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Gustaf Alströmer (01:23:27):
I tweet sometimes on twitter.com/gustaf. The most useful things that I put out is probably on the YC's YouTube channel. So I record a couple videos on growth, on sales, on how to talk to customers. I actually send them to people all day long because the Start School videos that we made are a lot of preparation went into it and it answers most of the questions that people have. So watch those first, I would say. But yeah, sometimes I tweet other stuff that people can follow. That's fine. How can people be useful to me? I love hearing feedback from founders, what they're working on. I want to hear kind of questions they have about their companies. But I want to also really emphasize that to apply to YC, you don't need to know any of us. You don't need to reach out to us. It doesn't make any specific difference.

(01:24:15):
The principles in YC is that you should be able to become an insider in YC in Silicon Valley without knowing anybody. That's kind of what the application process is about. So feel free to reach out to us if you have questions, but don't feel like that's required to be a good YC applicant. It's actually the opposite in that we read and treat all the applications equally. Thank you so much for listening to this podcast. I mean, it made me happy you made all the way to the end.

Lenny (01:24:44):
Yeah, extra credit for listening to the end. I also just want to say while you're saying that, it feels like YC is such a good force for the world. It just enables so much innovation and progress. And if technology is what drives the world forward, IC is so at the center of a lot of that. So just huge props to what YC is doing and what you're doing, Gustaf.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:25:02):
We feel a lot of responsibility towards that. That's for sure.

Lenny (01:25:05):
All right, I'll let you go. Again, Gustaf, thank you for doing this.

Gustaf Alströmer (01:25:09):
Thank you so much.

# The science of product, big bets, and how AI is impacting the future of music | Gustav Söderström

## Transcript

Gustav Söderström (00:00:00):
The internet started with curation, often user curation. So you took something, some good like people or books or music, and you digitize it and you put it online and then you ask users to curate it. And that was your Facebook, Spotify, and so forth. And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well. And I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products. We have to rethink the user interface and the experience for recommendation first era. And so what does that mean in the generative era? No one really knows yet.

Lenny (00:00:47):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Gustav Söderström. Gustav is a product legend and he's now the co-president, chief product and chief technology officer at Spotify, where he's responsible for Spotify's global product and technology strategy and oversees the product design data and engineering teams at the company. I've had Gustav on my wish list of dream guests to have on this podcast since the day I launched the podcast and I'm so happy we made it happen.

Lenny (00:01:19):
In our conversation, we dig into what Gustav has learned about taking big bets and what to do when they don't work out, how Spotify moved away from squads and how they structure their teams now, how AI is already impacting their product, and also the future of music generated by AI. Also, why all great products need to pull some magic trick, how accurately succession represents Swedish business culture, and his hilarious analogy of peeing in your pants. Enjoy this episode with Gustav Söderström after a short word from our sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by Microsoft Clarity, a free easy to use tool that captures how real people are actually using your site. You can watch live session replays to discover where users are breezing through your flow and where they struggle. You can view instant heat maps to see what parts of your page users are engaging with and what content they're ignoring. You can also pinpoint what's bothering your users with really cool frustration metrics like rage clicks and dead clicks and much more. If you listen to this podcast, you know how often we talk about the importance of knowing your users, and by seeing how users truly experience your product, you can identify product opportunities, conversion wins, and find big gaps between how you imagine people using your product and how they actually use it.

This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

Lenny (00:03:44):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at getE-P-P-O.com. That's geteppo.com. And 10X, your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:04:08):
Gustav, welcome to the podcast.

Gustav Söderström (00:04:11):
Thanks for having me, Lenny. Pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:04:13):
It's my pleasure to have you on. So at this point, you've been at Spotify for over 14 years, which is a rare feat in the tech world, and you've held a lot of different roles while you've been at Spotify. Can you just start off by giving us a sense of what these various roles and what you've done over the years at Spotify and then just what are you up to these days? What are you responsible for now?

Gustav Söderström (00:04:33):
So I came into Spotify in early 2009, late 2008. And my job then, I had been an entrepreneur, started some of my own companies in the, back then, very, very early feature phone, smartphone space. So I had a bunch of knowledge there. I had sold the company to Yahoo in the mobile space. I worked there for a while. I came back to Sweden and then I met through a mutual friend, Daniel Ek, the CEO and co-founder of Spotify. And they had built the desktop product already, the free streaming desktop product, and it was amazing and I could try it, but they needed someone to figure out what to do with mobile. And because I had been an entrepreneur in that space, I got that job.

Gustav Söderström (00:05:20):
So my job was to head up mobile for Spotify and figure out what the mobile offering would be, which was a challenge because, obviously, Spotify desktop was a free on-demand streaming application and back then, specifically with edge networks, you couldn't really stream at all in real time. The performance wasn't there and also you couldn't fund that with an ads model. So it was a product and business model innovation that was a lot of fun. So that's how I started. Then after a few years, I took on all of product development for Spotify. And then a few years later, I actually took on the technology responsibility, the CTO role for Spotify as well. And recently, my official title is co-president of Spotify together with Alex Nordstrom. So we run half of the company each. I run the product and technology side and he runs for the business and content side. So that's the super fast version.

Gustav Söderström (00:06:20):
Aside from getting more responsibilities taking on the technology department, it has been the same job by title. I've always reported to Daniel, but because Spotify's grown so much every six to 12 months, it's been starting at a new company. First, it was sort of a Swedish Nordic challenge and then it was a European challenge and then it was getting into the US and then we became a public company. So it's as if I had jumped around between a lot of jobs actually, even though it was largely the same title and role.

Lenny (00:06:55):
Your story makes me think of the classic be careful what you're good at because you end up taking on more and more. And clearly, you've been given more and more responsibility over the years and so clearly things are going well and you're doing well.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Shifting a little bit. So you're on my podcast currently. You actually have your own podcast, which was this limited series on the product story of Spotify, which I listened to and loved, and it's surreal to listen to your voice in real time because I've been listening to that recently in preparation for this conversation. Two questions, just what made you decide to launch your own podcast knowing you had a full-time job and a lot going on and the production value for your podcast was very high for what I could tell? And then two, just what did you learn from that experience in terms of the product you ended up a building and just empathizing with the podcast creator side of?

Gustav Söderström (00:07:41):
There were a bunch of different reasons why I did that. One is, and not a small one, I think, like you, I love writing and I have this secret creator dream in me. I used to write blog posts a long time ago and I write internally a lot. You can't write that much externally when you work at a company like this.

Lenny (00:08:01):
Yeah.

Gustav Söderström (00:08:02):
But I love writing and talking and presenting. So there was certainly that. And then no small part was, from a product point of view, to empathize with one of our main constituents, the podcast creator. I'm, unfortunately, not a great musician. I try to play instruments and so forth, but I don't have any records. I don't sing very well. But I decided to make a podcast and that taught me a huge amount about what it's like to be a creator, creating different styles of podcast.

Gustav Söderström (00:08:33):
For example, we wanted to do a higher production cost podcast with music and then right away you run into a bunch of problems as Spotify is actually pretty well positioned to solve, but still, it's really hard to have music in a podcast from a rights perspective. So you understand all these problems that podcasters have and you can be better at solving them. But the biggest benefit and the real reason for doing the public podcast was that I have actually done an internal podcast through a hack where we could gate the podcast-only employees. And I tried to figure out internally how to build more culture around Spotify and help define for new employees and existing employees, who we are, the mistakes we did, the successes we had, and how we think about strategy specifically in product strategy because we were quite well known externally for technology and the squads and all of these things, not so much for product strategy.

Gustav Söderström (00:09:36):
And because I love storytelling more than Google Docs, I decided to do an internal podcast and I went around and I interviewed actually Daniel's direct reports. So the CMO, the CHRO and CFO. And just ask them about a bunch of stuff. And the idea was to make them more approachable for employees because I felt listening to podcasts, even these people that have no idea who I am because I've never met them, I feel like I know them, I feel like I know how they think and I just like them much more. So the secret idea was, what if you could get to know your leaders much better than you do through occasional meetings or some town hall? So I did that internally, and because I'm a product person, we ended up talking a lot about product and product strategy. And people internally really like that.

Gustav Söderström (00:10:26):
So next time, the question was, what if people that don't even work at Spotify yet could feel as if they knew people at Spotify? That'd be great because most leaders in most companies are very opaque and appear as some otherworldly creatures that aren't really real, I think, when you see them in business papers or something. So what if you have heard them talk for an hour or so? So that was general idea. So a combination of recruitment tool, sharing more about how we think about product strategy and just because I think it was a lot of fun. I got to interview a bunch of smart and interesting people both externally and internally.

Lenny (00:11:09):
Did it have the effect that you were hoping after looking back?

Gustav Söderström (00:11:12):
I think it did. The podcast did well and, no, we did not give it our own promotion. I had to compete as everyone else, which also gives you a lot of empathy for the problem of like, okay, now you have a product, what about user acquisition? How do you actually get people to listen to it? So it did achieve what I wanted in the sense that we have this thing called intradays where especially in the past few years when we've hired a lot, we actually fly people to Stockholm for an onboarding session to learn about Spotify. And the leadership is on stage, talking about what they do and the departments and strategy and so forth. And it's very common that people come and tell me that, "Oh, I listened to this podcast or this and the episode and it's at least one of the key reasons why I joined or sometimes the reason why I joined." So it's anecdotal, but it may be in the many tens of people, at least, who have said it. So that seems to work.

Lenny (00:12:12):
That's really interesting. Just again, and this comes up a few times on the podcast, is just the power of content in all these different ways for hiring for culture building. And it sounds like the original goal was just internally build this clinic culture and strategy.

Gustav Söderström (00:12:24):
That was the original goal, make senior leadership more approachable and reduce the distance and then also share more of the thinking in an entertaining way rather than just through docs that people end up not reading.

Lenny (00:12:38):
I love that. So I was listening to it, as I said, and what was really interesting is I think episode four was actually all about AI, and I think your first attempts at leveraging machine learning in AI within Spotify. And I think that's what led to Discover Weekly and a few other tools. And that was years ago. And it's interesting listening to it now where AI is, again, a huge deal. And so I'm curious very tactically on the product team what you advise product managers and product teams on how to think about AI in their product thinking and also just in their day-to-day work.

Gustav Söderström (00:13:12):
I can give a few examples there and I don't know that we're more sophisticated than anyone else, but we'll be doing at least the traditional machine learning for quite a long time. And I think in the podcast, I think I talked about the journey of the internet in stages. And one way to think about it is that the internet started with curation of the user curation. So you took something, some good, like people or books or music and you digitize it and you put it online, and then you ask users to curate it. And that was your Facebook, Spotify and so forth. And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well.

Gustav Söderström (00:14:04):
And I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products. So that's one lens. So I tend to talk to my teams about, even though it's all machine learning, I ask them to think of this as something completely different. The recommendation error was one type of machine learning. The generation error is a different type, so don't think of it as just more of the same, think of it as something actually completely new instead. And what we learned in ... Well, a few things. So if you look at this new era of large language models and the fusion models and so forth, there are two types of applications. As I said for the recommendation error, we had to rethink the user interface and the experience for recommendation first error.

Gustav Söderström (00:14:57):
And so what does that mean in the generative area? No one really knows yet. As usual, there are a bunch of iterative improvements. So we use these large language models to improve our recommendations. You can have bigger vectors that can have more cultural knowledge. You can use it for safety classification on podcasts that no one has listened to yet and so forth. So there's lots of obvious improvements and we're doing those. But so far, we've only really done one real generative product in the hard definition, which is a product that couldn't have existed without generative AI, and that is the AI DJ. So that's a concept that we've been thinking about for a very long time. And the AI DJ is you press a button, a digitized person, there's a real person named X, digitized X. So he's now an AI, comes on and talks to you about music that you like and suggests music, and you can listen to it. And if you don't like it, you can just call him back and he says, "Okay, now, let's listen to something maybe from a few summers ago," or "Here's some new stuff that were trending yesterday in The Last of Us episode or something like that."

Gustav Söderström (00:16:10):
So that product couldn't have existed without generative AI, both generating the voice and generating the content of what the voice says. So you can have individualized, personalized voice at the scale of half a billion people. And so we had the use case we have seen for many, many years. Sometimes people call it the radio use case. We called it the zero intent use case internally when you actually don't know what you want to listen to at all.

Gustav Söderström (00:16:40):
Spotify wasn't that good. Spotify was good when, at least roughly, you knew the use case of what you want to do, if it was a workout or dinner. We had lots of options for all of those. But if you really didn't know at all, it was hard to open Spotify and stare at it. And people used to say longingly that this was the one thing that radio was good at. Radio was quite bad, to be honest. I mean, it's not personalized to you at all. It's not on demand. You come in in the middle of things, it's actually terrible in many ways. But people still often say that there was something good about it. And I think that's something was the fact that you had a knob and you could just switch between contexts. It's like no, boring, boring, boring, boring, okay, this is good.

Gustav Söderström (00:17:23):
And Spotify never had that mode of, I don't know what I want, but I want to cycle through things until I find something that I like. And I think with the AI DJ, that's actually the use case we managed to solve. So X comes on and says, "I'm going to suggest something to you that you can listen to." And if you like it, you can keep listening, but if you don't like it, you bring him back again and you change channel. And for one reason or another, we tried to solve that for many times for a long time, but just starting to play a random song without any context as to why you would hear this, it just never worked. So that was our first foray into a product that couldn't exist before. And I think to your question of principles around that, there are a few pretty distinct principles that we've learned.

Gustav Söderström (00:18:09):
One that I really like that is not my principle at all, I think it is straight from Chris Dixon, is the principle of fault-tolerant user interfaces. So I can't say how many times during the early machine learning era when we said we're moving from curation to recommendation. I saw a design sketch that was a single big play button because clearly that is the simplest user interface you can do, but if you don't understand the performance of your machine learning, you can't design for it. The quality of your machine learning, if you're going to have a single play button, needs to be literally 100% or zero prediction error, and that's never the case. So let's say that you have a one in five hits, four out of five things are done, then you need a UI that probably at least shows five things at the same time on screen. So you have a one in five of something being relevant on screen.

Gustav Söderström (00:19:03):
So you need to understand the performance of your machine learning to design for it. It needs to be fault tolerant and often you need an escape hatch for the user. So you make a prediction. But if you were wrong, it needs to be super easy for the user say, "No, you're wrong, I want to go to my library or to this or to that." So we have that principle of having fault-tolerant user interface and a user interface that corresponds to the current performance of your algorithms. And I think that is going to be true for generative machine learning as well. I think a very clear example actually is Mid Journey. If you think about the early Mid Journey user interface inside the Discord channel, actually generating an image was very, very slow.

Gustav Söderström (00:19:48):
It took a long time to generate high-quality image and they could have built the silver button thing where you put in a prompt, you wait for minutes, you get an image, and I think one out of four times, it's going to be bad. So you would've been disappointed three out of four times and it's a minute each, so like four minutes later, you'd be, "This is a shitty product." What they did was they generated four simultaneous low-res images very quickly and you could say, "So apparently, their performance was probably one in four, that's why they showed four and not six." And so one in four was usually pretty good. You click that one and either continue to iterate or scale it up. So that's also an example of, I think, people understanding where the performance of generative AI was when they built the UI. So that's something that I would be inspired by.

Gustav Söderström (00:20:37):
And for the AI DJ specifically, another principle is to try to avoid this urge of just wanting to show off the technology and then have this voice that talk and talk and talk and talk. You have to remember that people came there for the music. So the principle for the AI DJ coming from the team, by the way, this was a bottoms-up product actually, it required a lot of support. We actually acquired big companies and so forth to be able to build it. But the idea had been built by teams bottom up. So the principle there was literally to do as little as possible and get out of the way. And I think that was really helpful. It's not telling you what the weather is and what happened in the news and going on and on and on about this band. It is trying to get you to the music and I think that's why it's working because it is working very well for us.

Lenny (00:21:24):
I love this distinction between recommendation and generation. And this begs the question of, there's this trend that I imagine you're seeing of people autogenerating music using artists catalog. There's this Drake and The Weeknd thing that came out a week or two ago. Where do you think this ends up going and how do you think artists adjust to this world where music can just be autogenerated? This play button is all of it is generated versus just like the DJ in between the songs.

Gustav Söderström (00:21:53):
First, big caveat, this is just super early. No one knows anything about how this is going to play out or the legal landscape and so forth, but I think it's going to have a lot of impact. And I think if we talk about two things, one is what it could do for music, the other is the right situation, and if rights-holders are getting compensated and so forth. So we talk about the first thing in isolation. I think an interesting example is right about when I grew up, Avicii came along. And it's interesting to think about because Avicii was not really considered by the existing music industry as a real artist because he couldn't really play an instrument and he couldn't sing, and he was just sitting with this computer in this DAW, digital audio workstation. And so it wasn't really considered real music. And I think now all of us consider it very real music and that he had tremendous real musical talent.

Gustav Söderström (00:22:51):
So I think right now, we're probably in the face where people say this isn't real music and it's somehow fake. I think the way to think about these diffusion models if and when they get good enough at generating music is probably the same like an instrument. It's just a much more powerful instrument and we'll probably see a new type of creator that wasn't proficient at any instrument and they couldn't assemble a full orchestra and do the thing that they had in their head and they can now generate very new things. I also think, by the way, that there is this distinction between AI music and real music that doesn't exist. For sure, very talented real musicians are using AI to get better and to help create new ideas. So that distinction doesn't really exist. It's all going to be AI. The question is what percentage, which makes the problem harder because you can't talk about if it should exist or not.

Gustav Söderström (00:23:50):
You have to talk about what percentage should exist and who gets to use it or not. But I think the way to think about it is probably as an instrument and that could help create a huge amount of art. And I think this is not news to you who probably use these things a lot, but I think if you don't use these generative models, there is the perception that you tell it to create a hit and you will get that. That's not how it works. Actually, what these models do is because they've been listening to a lot of music, they are very good at doing something that sounds very similar to what already exists. Actually being original is very hard. And from one point of view, as it now gets easier to create more generic music, it will actually be more difficult than ever to be truly unique.

Gustav Söderström (00:24:39):
So I still think there would be tremendous skill in creating something truly unique. And my hope would be that what happened with the DAW and that technology jump was you got a whole new genre like EDM that you couldn't really produce it with an orchestra or live. And maybe we'll see completely new music styles with these technologies. I think that would be very exciting. So that's on the positive side, but then you have the rights issue, which I have a lot of empathy for. And Spotify specifically has seen this before. So we had a different technology shift like this, which was the technology shift to online downloads of music and piracy and peer to peer. So first, it was a big technology shift in peer to peer and it was exciting for consumers. More consumers started listening to more music than ever. And I think that's where we are now with generative AI.

Gustav Söderström (00:25:31):
There's a new technology, but it also required a new business model before creators and industry could actually participate and benefit from this. And that's, obviously, self-serving to say because we were a big part of innovating that business model. But I still think that's what's necessary and I hope that that's what I and we could be part of. So I think we've seen the first part, the technology shift, and there will probably be a lot of discussion and chaos here which have a lot of empathy for, but I think we haven't seen the second part yet. What is a model where this could be a benefit? What actually happened after piracy is that the music industry got bigger than ever, not just as big but bigger than ever. And I think that could happen with this technology as well. But we're right in the beginning.

Lenny (00:26:20):
So along the same lines, something else you teach is this idea of all truly great products have to pull some magic trick. This comes up in your podcast a lot and I think you mentioned this other places, and thinking about all the stuff you're talking about here, it feels like, in a sense, everything's going to feel like magic because AI's baked into it.

Gustav Söderström (00:26:38):
I think when we did the AI DJ, we did a small version of that. When people first listened to it, we could see that reaction in use of testing when they've wondered ... So the magic trick there was that how could they record this person saying so many different things because it's talking about my music. So the magic trick was, obviously, didn't record a person saying, it's generated, and that magic trick wears off. You hear it all the time now and so forth, but it was one of those magic tricks. So I still think that concept is important and it seems to correlate with products going viral and taking off.

Gustav Söderström (00:27:15):
And I think it was the same using something like Dall-E or Stable Diffusion or Mid Journey the first time. It completely seemed like a magic trick. And, obviously, there is no magic, it's just data and statistics. But I think getting to that point and iterating a product to the point where it feels like magic the first time is very helpful. And it's often a question of just getting the performance to a certain level, scoping down, removing things. There's a lot of fine-tuning, I think, that makes you cross that line from it's cool and impressive but not magic to it feels like magic. I don't understand how this could be done.

Lenny (00:28:00):
Yeah, it reminds me of the launch of GBT which ended up being the biggest, most fastest growing product in history, and it's like the epitome of a magic trick. It feels like actual magic.

Gustav Söderström (00:28:09):
Absolutely, absolutely. And to most people, it is still very ... Actually to a lot of ascent, even to researchers, it's a little bit magical. No one really understands fully. So I guess there's maybe some magic left in the world.

Lenny (00:28:23):
Absolutely. And I think a lot of people are worried about not understanding what's going on there. Shifting to the way you all build product at Spotify. So Spotify is famous for popularizing this idea of squads and tribes. And correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys have moved away from that approach.

Gustav Söderström (00:28:39):
Yeah, that's right.

Lenny (00:28:41):
Okay. So I'd love to understand just why you shifted and what you learned from that approach to building product, and then just like how do you organize the teams now? What do you do now?

Gustav Söderström (00:28:51):
This was something that we focused a lot on early and it turned out to be smart of us to name these things into squads and chapters and so forth. It wasn't really ... Well, maybe it was deliberately branding, but it wasn't for purposes of branding that we made it up. We made it up because we thought it was a good structure to use and we needed names for things and this was the early internet eras you were allowed to make things up. And so it was very good for where we were at the time and it certainly helped us in recruiting. It's become a little bit of a cost to us because people still think that we organize that way and it's not a very efficient way of being organized at this scale or maybe even if you started over right now because we've learned more.

Gustav Söderström (00:29:35):
But I think the big difference is the idea with the squad specifically was twofold. They were supposed to be small and full stack. So squad should be about seven people and it should have front and backend, mobile, QA, agile coaches and so forth, and it should be very autonomous was the idea. And that's really what we shifted. So, first of all, as you grow the company, scaling in increments of seven engineers just creates a ton of overhead. So, obviously, our teams now tend to be much bigger, maybe two, three times that at least per manager to maybe have 14 or something instead of seven and just less overhead roles. So that's one. It looks more traditional as you learn more and is reasonable as you scale. The second big thing I think we struggle with was back then when I joined, the average age at Spotify was ... I mean, I was the oldest and this was 14 years ago. So I think the average age was probably under 30 or something and it wasn't most tech companies.

Gustav Söderström (00:30:46):
And so we had coming from Sweden, which is a different culture than the US, and I love a lot of things about Swedish culture and I think we managed to keep the best parts, but Sweden is a very bottoms-up autonomous culture. There's this famous drawing on how you make decisions in Sweden. In the US, I think it's just a hierarchy. In Sweden, it's a circle. It's in a circle, no one is in the middle, there is no leader and so forth.

Lenny (00:31:13):
Interesting.

Gustav Söderström (00:31:14):
So I think by culture, we're very inspired by this super autonomous thing. And I think the idea with autonomy is very reasonable and the right one, which is we work and we are hiring the smartest people we can find and we pay high salaries for that. So if you're hiring smart people, one way to think about it is you're renting brain power.

Gustav Söderström (00:31:39):
So if you're renting all of this expensive brain power and then you give them no room to think for themselves, that doesn't sound smart, then you should actually hire less smart people and keep your costs down or something. So I think you have to give a bunch of autonomy to actually maximize the value of the investment you're making. So that's very reasonable that you would give a lot of space for people to use as much of their talent and capacity as possible. But the problem with that is if you put autonomy very far towards the leaves of the organization, and also if you combine that with having a very junior organization, which we did back then, there's a fair chance that you're just going to produce heat. You're going to have a hundred squads with a hundred strategies running in a hundred directions. And Spotify has been there in that camp.

Gustav Söderström (00:32:29):
I mean, we managed to get somewhere, for sure, in spite of this, but I'd struggle to say we were efficient in doing that. So we've done a few things. The team structure is more traditional, larger teams, less overhead. And we've been specifically working with where in the org do we put the autonomy because the extremes are at the leaves and we were there. The other extreme may be at the top, let's say maybe some Twitter, there's one person. Both have problems. If you have it at the leaves, you're going to produce a lot of heat. If you have it at the top, you need someone with a lot of capacity and Elon has a lot of capacity, but you are, by definition, going to bottleneck. All decisions have to go through there. And Daniel, it's not his personality that he even wants to make all the decisions.

Gustav Söderström (00:33:19):
He wants to maximize throughput rather than to bottleneck the throughput. So the question is, if it's not at the top and not at the very bottom, where do you put it? And what we've found, which I don't think is very contrarian at all, I think this is the case in most companies, is around the VP level. So if you have Daniel, then you have the C level, myself and others, then you have the VP level, that is a good mix of instead of having one person in the company think, so only Daniel then and the rest just do, you have on the VP level in the company this many tens to maybe hundreds of people that have a lot of autonomy to think. So you get a good amount of freedom of thought and people thinking in different directions, but it's not like 8,000 people. And these people on the VP level are both quite a lot of them, but they're also usually quite senior. They have a lot of pattern recognition.

Gustav Söderström (00:34:16):
So I think that solves for, it's a good ... If you think of it as an optimization problem, it's a good optimization space. So the autonomy level in Spotify now tends to be quite high at the VP level and then lower around those levels.

Lenny (00:34:33):
And when you say autonomy, what does that actually mean? Is it the VP of, say, the podcasting product has a lot of say over what happens and there's not a ton of ... I don't know how involved are people above? And I know Maya's the VP of product, I believe, for the podcast product.

Gustav Söderström (00:34:48):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:34:49):
Who I think is going to come on the podcast someday. What does that mean in terms of Tommy for her, what practically?

Gustav Söderström (00:34:54):
So it means that I would ask Maya to define a strategy for what we do in podcasting, how are we going to be different, why would a podcaster want to be here? Whereas another company, I will make that strategy or another company, Daniel would make that strategy. Same with ... The AI DJ, for example, came from our personalization team. And so that was a bet that they made. So they have autonomy to make those kinds of bets and define strategies. Same with the user interface, we have an experienced team, can talk about the org structure later, but I put a lot of autonomy on the VP of experience to define and suggest what it is that we want to do. And in other companies, I would define all of that myself, for example.

Lenny (00:35:45):
Just going even a little bit further here, I know you have just strong opinions on the way to organize teams and how the organization helps you optimize for specific things. What are your just thoughts along those lines and what have you learned about how the impact of organization and what you're optimizing for?

Gustav Söderström (00:36:03):
Yeah. So I talk about an idealized spectrum or maybe not idealized but exaggerated spectrum. Nothing is really true, but you create extremes to make a point. So on one spectrum, you have something like Amazon, which is known for two-pizza teams, no dependencies. You try to minimize dependencies so you can run in parallel. Teams compete with each other even on the same project and so forth. But they have direct access to the user.

Gustav Söderström (00:36:37):
And so the benefit here is if you have an idea, the time to get the user is very low and it has worked for them. It's produced Kindle, it produced Alexa, it's produced a lot of very novel things. There are a few interesting downsides here. One downside that I'm extremely impressed with Jeff Bezos' foreseeing is if you have teams that compete with each other, the incentives are to hide your results, hide your code. And that should make for an organization that gets no platform leverage because no one's corporating. And I think either he had that insight or because he saw this, he had to do this, but he's well known for pushing extremely hard on hard APIs. If you don't create hard APIs to your technology, you're out. And if you think about it, it has to be that way because otherwise no one would do it.

Lenny (00:37:32):
And a hard API is essentially everyone knows how to use this API and connect to this team to interface with.

Gustav Söderström (00:37:38):
Exactly. You have to expose your technology to others. You have to maintain those APIs and they have to be very structured because otherwise the whole thing would collapse as everyone's supposed to compete because there are no incentives. You have to centrally force that. And interestingly, even though theoretically then they're the worst position to have a structured platform, I think, because they forced it so hard, they were the ones who did Amazon Web Services because they had such hard defined APIs because of this rule that it was easier for them to turn it inside out and expose it the rest of the world. Whereas if you look at someone like Google, I think they struggled more with externalizing their APIs maybe because it is so friendly and soft. So they didn't need as hard APIs on the inside because there was no competition. People could just go into each other's code.

Gustav Söderström (00:38:18):
So it's interesting anecdote around it, but the main point is you're faster there, but it's going to be hard to corporate. And so you will see something like maybe exaggerating a bit. Sometimes you'll see multiple search boxes on the same page from different teams. And this has been true in Spotify, by the way, as well. You've seen multiple toasters on the Now Playing view coming up from different teams because they're working. When we were in the autonomous mode, everyone running. And then ... So you get the benefit of speed, but you get the drawback of shipping your org chart and shipping complexity to the end user. But clearly, that's been the right choice for Amazon because they're a trillion-dollar company. But then on the other spectrum, you have something like Apple who's also a trillion-dollar company. So clearly, both models work, where you would never see two search boxes from the same team popping up on an iPhone. That is centrally organized by something that is close to single individual.

Gustav Söderström (00:39:20):
So they are instead in what is probably the world's biggest largest functional org, they're doing as much. If you think about what goes into the Apple, I mean, they certainly do everything we do. They have music service, podcast service, audiobooks, and they have a billion other services. So it's not like they have an easier problem. And yet they build something that feels more like it was built by a single developer for a single user. So they centralize and they have this bottlenecking function that everything has to go through and be decided how it fits with everything else. And so that has the benefit of the user experience being simpler and not shipping the org chart and increasing complexity. But it also has the drawback of speed without having facts on it. I've heard people working at Apple have said, "Yeah, it took seven years to get that thing to market," because you just had to wait in the pipeline.

Gustav Söderström (00:40:17):
So you have these extremes. And I think the most interesting example, I think, to think about is when you double click the power button on an iPhone, the Apple Pay comes up. That decision, how did that happen? You can imagine that all the services team would like to pop up when you double click that button. And so someone had to decide, should music come up, should payments come up, should something else come up? And so they have a different structure there. And on that spectrum of centralized versus decentralized, because of our strategy, which is we're a single application, trying to add or not trying to, we have added multiple types of content with actually very different business models on the backend, rev shares and royalties and book deals and so forth into single user experience. That is our strategy. We think the user experience in keeping that simple is the most important thing.

Gustav Söderström (00:41:12):
So we've chosen more of the centralized model, where these different vertical businesses, if you think about it, the music business, podcast, audiobooks business, they have it to go through a single recommendation organization because that's another problem. Which one do you recommend to which user? Should be a book or podcast or music? And how do you weigh them against each other? And also the user interface could easily get incredibly complicated if everyone built their own UI. The music team built their UI and then someone added features on top. So that's how we chose to optimize. But it is based on our strategy and I think both models work.

Lenny (00:43:05):
It's interesting these two examples you gave, Apple and Amazon, they're two of the biggest companies in the world and they're like at the extremes of these two into the spectrum. And it's interesting, most companies are somewhere in the middle. I wonder if there's just a benefit to being in an extreme and that ends up being really important.

Gustav Söderström (00:43:21):
I think so. In almost all industries, you have this smiling curve concept, where you want to be at the extremes on the smiling curve, and that's where big business opportunities are but not in the middle. So it's probably true in terms of organizational models as well.

Lenny (00:43:34):
Speaking of extremes, I want to talk a bit about taking big bets. So you guys had this big launch event recently where you basically redesigned the whole primary feed of Spotify to make it feel more like where apps are going, like TikTok reels feel of just stream, and you start hearing videos and music starts playing and some people loved it, some people did not. And I'm curious as a product leader, how you think about thinking long term and dealing with people that are just like, "What the hell's ... I hate change, stop changing things." How do you think about that? Who do you listen to? Who do you ignore? How do you know to stay the course? How do you approach that?

Gustav Söderström (00:44:10):
Yeah, you're being very kind. There was a lot of negative feedback on Twitter on some of that. So let me actually dig into some detail because I think for product people listening to this, this is an interesting lesson that I think few companies talk about because you want talk about everything that went exactly as you thought they would and you don't want to talk about the things that didn't go exactly as you thought they would.

Gustav Söderström (00:44:39):
So I'll go through what we are trying to achieve and what we learned. So Spotify is mainly a background application, and for a long time, we've been considered very good at background music and podcast recommendation. When the phone is in your pocket and you're listening to an EDM playlist or pop playlist or something, we're really good at inserting another EDM track there or another pop track there or something like that in the background.

Gustav Söderström (00:45:09):
What we hear from users again and again, though, is that they say that they get trapped in a taste bubble. So I love my Spotify, I love this, but I'm a little bit bored with EDM now and Spotify's not suggesting something completely new. And if you think about that problem, it may sound similar to the recommendation problem, it's just another recommendation problem, but it's actually fundamentally different because when you're recommending another EDM track inside the EDM playlist, you have a lot of signal from that user that they like EDM. But if you're going to recommend a completely new genre, by definition, you have no idea. Because if you had an idea, it wasn't new to them. So you can't know anything. So back to hit rate, your hit rate is going to be incredibly low when you suggest something completely new to the user.

Gustav Söderström (00:46:03):
So this problem of helping people get out of the taste bubble isn't that easy as it sounds. And we can't really take some genre that maybe isn't typical. So I'm a big fan of Reggaeton, for example. It's not typically ... It's not that common in Sweden. And if you would look the rest of my profile, it's EDM heaviness, you probably wouldn't have guessed it. And Spotify wouldn't have guessed it. So if I'm listening to my favorite EDM playlist in the background or maybe my metal playlist, metal is very big in Sweden, it's really hard for us to just insert a Reggaeton track in the middle of that. Most people are going to think Spotify's broken.

Lenny (00:46:41):
Yeah.

Gustav Söderström (00:46:41):
What the hell are they thinking? So that doesn't really work. So in order to help people break out of their taste bubbles, you need something different. You need something where your hit ratio can be very low and you need people to expect it to be very low.

Gustav Söderström (00:47:00):
So when we recommend things in the background, our hit ratio needs to be at least nine out of 10, maybe one dud is okay, but if you get five duds, you're going to think we broke your playlist and your session. We need something where one out of 10 is a success. If you find one gem out of 10 tries, you're very happy. So you need a completely different paradigm. And you also need to be able to go through many candidates quickly because the hit rate is so low. You can't take three minutes per item. It's like, "Okay, I didn't like this," and it's still like two minutes left before the next one comes on. You need to quickly say, "No, no, no." So the obvious candidates for this are these feed-type experience, where you can go through lots of content, you're expecting the hit ratio to be much lower. And if you don't like it, the cost is very low, you just swipe.

Gustav Söderström (00:47:50):
And then this is the reason why people have been ... When they want to break out of their taste bubbles or when they come into Spotify and listen to something completely new, it is usually because they found it on one of these services, like a TikTok or YouTube or something, where they get exposed to lots of new content. So people were asking us for these tools and so that's what we wanted to solve for. And so we built a bunch of features, feed-like structures, where you can go through either a new genre with many tracks or a podcast channel with genre with many episodes or even full playlists. And we implemented those and we put them in something called subfeeds. So in the current experience, and this is roll out worldwide, if you click the podcast subfeed, you get a feed of podcast episodes. Click the music subfeeds, you get a feed of playlists where you can go through many playlists. And if you don't understand the name, you can quickly hear what they sound like and check out a few tracks and understand if this is for you. And if you go through the search and browse page, you can find completely new genres that you can quickly go through.

Gustav Söderström (00:48:59):
And so those are working as we intended. People go to them when they want to find new music. They browse through them and they save new songs. So they're working as we intended. The thing that didn't work as we intended was when users asked us for this again and again, we took the sum of these things and we put it on Home because people ask so much about discovery and we can see clearly how correlated discoveries with retention on Spotify and so forth. But what we misjudged or failed or rather learned about our own homepage is that the way it works right now, and this is what you can see in the Twitter comment, if you remove the angry voices and try to see what they're saying, they're saying the following, which is actually quite clear in the quantitative data as well, that if you look at what people do on Spotify's homepage, the current one, it is almost 90% what we call recall.

Gustav Söderström (00:49:59):
So it is either getting to a session that you're already in or a specific playlist that you know you want to get to or at least a specific use case. So you come in with a high intent, you actually knew what you wanted, and maybe only 10% of the time as a true discovery, like I don't know what I want. So if you think about, that is 90% recall and 10% discovery. When we tested the design ... So the subfeeds were working and not working, but when we tested some of them on Home, we switched it from 90/10 to 10/90. So 10% recall, 90% discovery. And while people want discovery, they probably don't want 90% discovery, instead of 90% recall. So if you then look at the comments on Twitter, what they're saying is like, "Hey, I can't find my playlists anymore. Where are these things?"

Gustav Söderström (00:50:47):
They're not really complaining about the discovery, they're complaining about the things they don't get anymore. And we can see this in the quant data as well. And you can see traffic shifting from home into search and into library, which is a clear sign people are trying to find the things they can't find anymore. And you can even see people then trying to use these discovery tools which are optimized for quickly understanding new things to do the recall. Where's that workout playlist I know I want? And it's actually very bad UI for recall, it's like a slot machine, right? Very unpredictable if you ever get to that workout playlist. It was optimized for finding new things, not for recall of existing things. When you do recall, you want the dense UI with many items on screen because you know what it is you're looking for. So you don't need a lot of real estate when you're doing discovery of new things. You want a lot of pixels and you probably want sound because you don't know what it is.

Gustav Söderström (00:51:40):
So what we learn about our UI, and I think there's maybe a little bit of product jealousy here, you always look at other experiences. And if you look around, it could be forgiven for thinking that most other products, if you look at something like YouTube, for example, their homepage is exactly that. It's a huge single-item discovery feed with only new items. And people don't seem to tweet angrily about how angry they are at you to say they love YouTube and it's a big product. And I think what we discovered was that we actually did something really well on our homepage, which was supporting you being inside a multiple sessions at the same time. So you could be in the middle of two podcasts and an audiobook and also them actually I just want to get to that workout playlist. I don't remember the name of it, but I know it's workout.

Gustav Söderström (00:52:31):
We actually did that part really well. I would venture just say much better than the other experiences where you literally have to go to some tab and into library and start browsing to get back to where you were. And so maybe it's path dependent. Because we have done recall pretty well, people got, I think, reasonably upset when they couldn't do the recall anymore. And we didn't want lose that because it was one of the things we did well and underestimated. And my takeaway is actually we do it better than other experiences. So we certainly want to keep that. So what we did was now we're just updating their hypothesis to achieve the same goal, which is these things are working and when people want to discover, they use them and they seem to work, they can also get better.

Gustav Söderström (00:53:20):
You're on this hill-climbing journey from a machine learning point of view, but the question is, how do you make sure that whenever people feel that they are in that I'm trapped in my taste bubble, they understand that these things are there and they're easy to use? So now we have a version of Home that we are also testing, obviously, where these things are very available but voluntary and you can still do all of the recall. And so from my point of view, this is the reason we A/B test because you want to be scientific about it and you want to learn as much as possible about your own product and your users. And now I'm sharing a lot of the learnings. Maybe we should keep them to ourselves, but my hunch is that it's going to make it a much better product.

Gustav Söderström (00:54:09):
But what I told my teams when we went into this, because I've done this a few times, agree to signing, I think there are two fundamentally different types of product development. One is designing a new feature. It is hard, but it's voluntary for people to use. So you do the AI DJ. Some people love it, that's fine. If you don't like it, it didn't make it worse for you. But when you redesign, it is much more tricky because it's not voluntary to participate in the redesign. So there's a cost even for people who don't like it. Then you have a very tricky problem here, which is there are going to be two types of feedback. One is you did something and it was right, but people are upset because you changed stuff. The other is you did something and it wasn't right, and people are also upset but for good reasons.

Gustav Söderström (00:55:08):
And so how do you separate these two? Because I think I explained this to ... When we talk through this with my teams, I think the analogy to think about is you have your desktop, your physical desktop, you have your computer in one place, you have your pencil over here, you have your notebook over there, and I come in and I just rearrange all of it. And you have spent, in our case, maybe 12 years with that setup. It doesn't matter if I have a lot of quantitative data that my new setup is better, you're going to get upset because you are effective in this old setup. And it's hard to tell those apart. The most classic use case is the Facebook newsfeed, which people are very upset about when it became a single newsfeed. But it turned out to solve a lot of user problems that you didn't have to run around all of Facebook collecting events yourself.

Gustav Söderström (00:55:58):
So there are some ways of understanding if you made it better, but people's habits are broken or if it's not better. And one thing is, for example, to look at new user cohorts that don't have that behavior versus all user cohorts and so forth. So we went through all of this with the teams. Before we did it, I said, "This is going to be painful." There's probably going to be a lot of tweets because chances that we get it exactly right are very low. So for that reason, it hasn't been very hard on the team. It is hard ... You want to respond to people, but the right way to do it is to listen, understand, try new hypothesis to really figure out what's going on. So I think I've done it maybe three or four times now. Three maybe. One unsuccessful, two successfully. So kind of knew what I was getting into.

Gustav Söderström (00:56:45):
So it's almost like you punish yourself, very painful, but also the most exciting things. And I think any product person knows that the easiest, the most straightforward thing to do is to iterate around where you are. There's no risk. You're not going to get fired, no user is going to get angry. But everyone also knows that eventually if you don't adapt new technologies, new paradigms, et cetera, you're going to get replaced. You have to find this balance of trying new things. And when you work in software, you have this tool of A/B testing and being scientific about it. When you build hardware, it's worse. If you're wrong, you're wrong. You can't update.

Lenny (00:57:26):
I love this story. I so appreciate you sharing it. I imagine also with a big launch like this, you can't actually A/B test it ahead of time because of the press season. They're like, "Oh my God, look what Spotify's doing." And so you're limited there. Imagine, right? You couldn't really test this ahead of time.

Gustav Söderström (00:57:40):
The hardest thing about this is if you're trying something completely new, the MVP needs to be very big so you can build a new IU, but if you didn't do algorithms for single item feed, you can't tell if it was the right idea but poor machine learning, right? UI poor machine learning. Or you have to build a lot and that gets quite expensive. That's actually ... The biggest why it's painful is not really the feedback from the outside. It is the cost you have to take on the inside. You incur a lot of costs as you're really hoping you're right.

Gustav Söderström (00:58:15):
And in our cases, the changes on the homepage aren't that hard for us to do. The important thing is that the underlying hypothesis of, can we help you break out of your taste bubble actually works and then you update the acquisition funnels into that experience. But I think the problem is that you need to get so many things in place to be able to say, "You might get a false negative," just because you didn't do it well or not. That's the biggest challenge, I think, with these big rewrites where everyone has to update everything before you can know if you're right or wrong.

Lenny (00:58:52):
What was that process like of helping you understand what is not working and what is working and what you wanted to change? I imagine there's a bunch of data you're looking at, some tweets, things like that. What was the tactical, "Oh, shoot, something's not going the way we expected, here's what we should do?"

Gustav Söderström (00:59:08):
Well, the feeds, we tested, but the home feed, we rolled out and tested afterwards. And we tested out on users, a few different variants of it. And then we got the data back and we looked more at the quantitative data. And we do a lot of user research where people sit and use the feeds to understand and build our own theorem mind of what is working and what is not working. And then, obviously, you look at user feedback, of course, and some users are very good at expressing what is of it that isn't working, others are not as good as expressing what isn't working. So it can be hard to parse that, but certainly, that's a factor as well.

Gustav Söderström (00:59:49):
And so then once you do that, then you have quantitative data to look at. And then you sit in recent through, what do you think is right and wrong? What are the different hypotheses? What is working, what is not working? And then just update and test again and again until you prove or disprove your hypothesis. Trying to be as scientific as possible about it. And also I think the biggest risk also when you've invested so much time in something is getting precious about things. You have to just be brutal. You have to believe in things 100% until the data says no and then you believe in something else 100%. That sounds easy. It's very hard to do, to the extent that people get upset when you do it because, for some reason, people don't like when people change their minds. It is what we should want from everyone. I would love a politician who said, "I'd looked at the data and I realized actually this is right and now I believe this." But we hate politicians that do that. They feel untrustworthy and we ridicule them.

Gustav Söderström (01:00:56):
So I think that's the biggest risk with anyone. You just have to be unemotional and just look at the proof and the data. And then if you do that, you just move on and then you get to where you want to be, and you solve the same problem but you adapt.

Lenny (01:01:14):
I really like that philosophy. Essentially, it's the idea of strong opinions loosely held. Is that-

Gustav Söderström (01:01:19):
Exactly. Exactly what it is. And it sounds so easy, but it's hard.

Lenny (01:01:23):
Right? Because to your point, people don't respect someone changing their mind. They're like, "Oh, I see, they were wrong the whole time and they were so confident about being wrong."

Gustav Söderström (01:01:31):
Yeah, exactly. And it's unclear why it is what we should want, but I think it has something to do with human psychology. We actually tend to love profits and people who hold very strong opinions with very little data. Those are the people we like. People will look at a lot of data and actually that, we don't like. Not sure why.

Lenny (01:01:57):
We're flawed creatures.

Gustav Söderström (01:01:59):
For sure.

Lenny (01:02:00):
Is there something that you've recently changed your mind about along these same lines that maybe comes to mind of like, "Oh, yeah?"

Gustav Söderström (01:02:06):
No, I think these learnings about the science system and homepage does really well, maybe better than others, that we don't want to wash out with a bath water or whatever the [inaudible 01:02:20] expression is. I think that's the biggest current learning I'm actually very happy about.

Lenny (01:02:26):
Yeah, I love learning that we're doing some really well that we didn't really realize necessarily and maybe we should lead into that more.

Gustav Söderström (01:02:34):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:02:35):
Going in a somewhat different direction. Shishir Mehrotra suggested to ask you something. He's on your board, I believe.

Gustav Söderström (01:02:41):
Yes.

Lenny (01:02:41):
And he suggested to ask you about your 10% planning time. What is that about?

Gustav Söderström (01:02:46):
This is a concept that I think Shishir has used for a long time ever since he worked at YouTube. And the idea is that, roughly, you shouldn't be spending more than 10% of your time planning versus executing or building, which means that if you're working quarterly 10 weeks, you should spend one week planning as we work in six-month increment. So we try to spend two weeks planning and roughly successful. And this is ... Actually, when we talk about org models, give a shout-out to Brian Chesky at Airbnb, who is actually one of the first, I think, to have these more contrarian old models. He's much more applesque than most of Silicon Valley. He also works in six-month increments. He has a lot of experience in that as well. So that's what the 10% planning time is. And I think if you find yourself planning much more than that, you're either planning too much or your execution period is just too short for that amount of planning. It's a rule of thumb, but I find that it works.

Lenny (01:03:53):
I asked a few PMs what I should ask you, PMs that work at Spotify actually, that I haven't told you. And someone pointed out that you always bring a lot of energy and clarity to a room. That's something they see you as really strong at. What have you learned about just the importance of that or just how to do that well as a leader?

Gustav Söderström (01:04:11):
Well, that's great to hear. I didn't know that so I'm trying to figure out what to answer. I think that the energy, I don't know. I guess I'm just excited about what I do. I've always been excited about technology. I love seeing new things. My core drive is still this notion of you see something which I think you'll empathize with that doesn't exist yet. And you're like, "Wow, I wonder if that could exist. That would be so cool." And then in order to get people to do it, you try to share that excitement. So I don't think I can bring a lot of energy for something I'm not excited about. So I have to work on things I actually believe in and that I'm excited about. And so maybe then the energy comes more naturally. Unfortunately, for me, so far, Spotify has been in this phase where a lot of innovation is allowed and I'm even asked to try to do new cool things.

Gustav Söderström (01:05:09):
Maybe I would have less energy for a pure optimization phase. On the clarity, I've always liked trying to explain things. It's a well-known fact that the best way to understand something is to try to explain to someone else. So I go around explaining things to people who didn't ask for it and not to sound smart, but to see if I actually understood it. And so maybe it's that practice. And on that note, I actually do ask my leaders that work for me and I ask them to ask their leaders to always explain themselves. And I think when ... We talked a little bit about autonomy and so forth, we don't promise everyone that they have to agree, but I think the promise we should make to all employees is that even if they don't agree, they should be entitled to understand why you're making the decision.

Gustav Söderström (01:06:06):
What I don't think is acceptable is to say, "No, we're going to do it this way because I'm more senior. I've seen this a bunch of times. You are not smart enough." All of those things. I think you have to explain yourself so you owe an explanation. And I find that valuable back to the only way to understand something is to explain it because it usually turns out that if you can't explain it yourself, you probably don't really even understand it yourself. Sometimes I think it's possible that you can have product instincts that are good but you can't express them. But most of them, when people say there's something there but they can't explain it, they actually don't understand it themselves. And many times, there actually isn't anything there. And also if you can explain it as a product person, that knowledge is now shared. So it just becomes much more effective for the organization. So sometimes I try to provoke people a little bit and say ... When people ask how much is art versus science, I say, "It's 0% art, 0% magic, and 100% science." And that's because I want to force people to try to explain it. I think we use the word art and magic. We have historically used the word art and magic for anything that we couldn't yet explain.

Gustav Söderström (01:07:33):
Genetics was magic and art until it was science. And quantum physics was magic until it was science. And most recently, actually, intelligence and creativity was art and magic until it was statistics in an LLM. So I think I try to push people to say, "Are you sure you can explain this?" because that forces people to think through. So maybe I like it and I try to force it on people. So maybe that's why people think I sometimes bring clarity.

Lenny (01:08:07):
I love that. Question along those lines, is there a system or an approach to explaining that you recommend? Is it just write it out in a document? Is it explaining in a certain style or is it just however is natural to the person?

Gustav Söderström (01:08:20):
I used to write everything and then write and rewrite and make it more and more condensed. So that worked for me. I don't write as much anymore. Now, I tend to walk and talk in my head myself. What I actually do is I ... And I found this different for different people and a lot of people want to bounce something with someone else, that's how they think. You repeat the same thing again and again and you get some feedback on it. And so I used to write a lot. I sometimes do when it's an idea I want to understand better. And at some point in my life, I would love to write something real like a book or something. But what I do increasingly now is I do my one-on-ones with peers or people who report to me or something, and I just put on AirPods and do a distributed walk and talk.

Gustav Söderström (01:09:12):
Both people are walking but in different locations and you spend an hour discussing something. That has actually turned out to be very, very fruitful. So then you get the power of you're not alone so you get more brain power than your own. And I don't think there is strong evolutionary proof for this, but there's certainly indications that you're thinking better when you're walking, whether it's because you're oxygenating your brain or because it's evolutionary for some other reason, I'm not sure. But I found that walking, talking, and thinking actually even if you're not in person, just over AirPods, it's super effective. It was the pandemic that forced us. I thought we would get less creative and strategizing will suffer during the pandemic and I found the opposite. We had more of this than ever and I started thinking about why, and I think it's all of these walk and talks that we did.

Lenny (01:10:07):
You threw out there that you want to write a book someday. What do you think your book would be about?

Gustav Söderström (01:10:11):
I have no idea. I have no idea. Statistically, it's probably going to be about something that I did a lot, so it has to be about something with technology or product or something. But I would love to write something fictional. That'd be a lot of fun.

Lenny (01:10:26):
Oh, boy. I'll pre-order as soon as that's up. Another concept I wanted to touch on that another PM suggested, which is he called it the P in the pants analogy. Does that ring a bell? And is that interesting to talk about?

Gustav Söderström (01:10:40):
I don't know exactly which occasion this person is referring to, but I know I've used that analogy a few times.

Lenny (01:10:49):
Okay. Promising.

Gustav Söderström (01:10:50):
I don't know if it's like a Swedish analogy because I thought it was more widely known. But the idea is that you do something ... So the saying is that's like peeing in your pants in cold weather. It feels really warm and nice to begin with. And then after a while, you start to regret it. It's about being short term, basically. So now I just say that's like peeing in the pants inside because people know what I mean. It's a short-term thing.

Lenny (01:11:21):
That's a hilarious way of communicating that idea. Must be a Swedish thing.

Gustav Söderström (01:11:25):
Yes, I think Swedish people do it for some reason, apparently others don't.

Lenny (01:11:30):
Maybe because it's cold a lot of times of the year.

Gustav Söderström (01:11:33):
Yes. That's probably it. This is a saying in cold climate. In the warm, it doesn't help. No one understands what you mean.

Lenny (01:11:39):
Speaking of Sweden, do you watch Succession?

Gustav Söderström (01:11:42):
Yes, I do.

Lenny (01:11:43):
Okay. So Sweden's become a big part of the show, specifically the company trying to ... I guess I don't want to spoil, but there's a character that's really important. Yes, exactly. That is Swedish. And so I'm curious just what do you think of the way they portray the Swedish culture and Swedish business dealings?

Gustav Söderström (01:11:59):
It's super fun to see this as a Sweden. And I guess, first and foremost, like anyone or any person or any country that gets represented by super tall, well-built, great looking Alexander Skarsgård should probably be pretty happy. So that's good. Then I think there's this episode where they are in Norway, without giving away too much.

Lenny (01:12:25):
Yep.

Gustav Söderström (01:12:26):
There are elements that are authentic. There's a lot of, I think, paid brand positioning from a Swedish brand named Fjällräven, which I think means arctic fox, which is actually a very popular outdoor brand in Sweden. So that's authentic. The sauna things and so forth are authentic. So it's real, but it's exaggerated. Actually, the thing that isn't very authentic is his negotiation style. Swedish people tend to be serious, cautious, and this guy's more of a player. So he's not the typical Swedish businessman from a negotiation tactic point of view, I think.

Lenny (01:13:11):
Yeah, it doesn't make me think of the way you described it where in Sweden, people sit in a circle and no one's in the center.

Gustav Söderström (01:13:15):
No, exactly. He's very much in the center.

Lenny (01:13:19):
And then when people go saunas, there are just like a chant, sauna, sauna [inaudible 01:13:23].

Gustav Söderström (01:13:23):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:13:24):
The last episode.

Gustav Söderström (01:13:25):
It's a great show. I love it.

Lenny (01:13:26):
I love it. This season is insane. I'm so curious where it all goes. Maybe just the last question before very exciting lightning round. Spotify is, at this point, the biggest podcasting platform for me specifically and I think globally, and I love using it. It works great. I'm curious just what's next for Spotify and specifically Spotify podcasting.

Gustav Söderström (01:13:48):
There are two sides to it. It's for Spotify creators and for Spotify listeners. For Spotify creators, there are two things. One is, and this is what we talked about at Stream On, we talked about it also for music discovery, but it's the same problem and even harder for podcast. So we're still focused very heavily on helping podcast creators find more audience. This is ... Like I said, it's even a bigger problem to break out of your habits and your bubbles in podcasting. Such a big investment to find a new podcast. And so that is something, I think, we could and should do really well. So we keep investing a lot there. And as I said, you'll see more as we roll up more features now.

Gustav Söderström (01:14:37):
The other big need for creators is monetization and you can monetize today in many ways with DEI and Spotify SEI and so forth. But we're working hard to expand that and make it better because the industry is starting to mature and I think this is one of the biggest needs and the biggest things we could do for creators to help them monetize better, actually both free and paid. We also have paid podcast. So that's on the creator side.

Gustav Söderström (01:15:07):
On the consumer side, I don't want to share too much. We've shown that we're investing a lot in discovery. I want to keep some secrets for when they roll out, but we are investing a lot in the user expense itself. I think it's far from optimal yet what it could be. One thing that I can share that we're investing a lot in is just the ubiquity and playback across different devices and in cars and all these things that we've done well for music. But I think the listening experience can get a lot more seamless. I think search can get better. The data about podcasts and ... Well, I don't want to say too much, but looking at AI and generative technology, there is a lot that can be done.

Lenny (01:15:52):
All right. Well, I'll take what I can get. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, Gustav. Are you ready?

Gustav Söderström (01:16:01):
I think I am. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:16:03):
Okay, we'll find out. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Gustav Söderström (01:16:08):
Okay. This is why I try to squeeze in seven into two and three. So if we start on product, I think it's well known, but one that I would recommend product people to read is 7 Powers by Hamilton Helmer, and Netflix has used a lot. We use a lot. It's just if you're starting out, it's great to have a strategy framework. No strategy framework is right, but having one is better than none.

Gustav Söderström (01:16:31):
Another in the space of mental models and frameworks, I think, is The Complete Investor by Charlie Munger. So, yes, it's about investment, but really it's a bunch of mental models that he uses. And I think the key takeaway is you have a problem, you should always apply three different models to it because what models do is they simplify and reduce dimensionality. The world has probably infinite dimensions and they reduces to maybe three or four. And the risk with that is you happen to get rid of a really important dimension, maybe pandemic diseases or something. But if you use three models that have different dimensions and was reduced in different ways, statistically, and it comes to the same conclusion, even the second model you apply vastly increases your chances that you're right. So that was a good book to read.

Gustav Söderström (01:17:24):
Then I think if we go outside of product, I'm very interested in just science and mathematics. So a few quick ones. The Mystery of the Aleph, an amazing book. Something Deeply Hidden by Sean Carroll on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. Helgoland by Carlo Rovelli on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics. The Beginning of Infinity and The Fabric of Reality by David Deutch. The Case Against Reality by Donald Hoffman on the evolution versus truth and that evolution doesn't optimize for seeing the truth, just for fitness. Gödel's Proof, I think, is an amazing book on his incompleteness theorem, that in any axiomatic systems, there will be true statements that can never be proven, which is a weird thing to think about. And then maybe one of my favorites is The Demon in the Machine by Paul Davies that, I think, is lesser known on how information is really just entropy and this concept of information engines, that you can power something by just information and exhaust is also information. That was not a quick list.

Lenny (01:18:39):
No, I was just going to say you've set the record for the most number of books, but it also shows how you've become so insightful and wise just reading books like these. And so I think if people are looking to get to a place that you're at now, I think there's the lesson.

Gustav Söderström (01:18:55):
I'll keep the artist much shorter, I promise.

Lenny (01:18:57):
It's all good. We got time. Okay, next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Gustav Söderström (01:19:03):
So we talked about Succession and it is a recent favorite. So I'll just frivolously take something that isn't recent but is an absolute favorite, which is Halt and Catch Fire, which I think is on FX. Amazing show. If you ever worked in technology, kind of starts out in the Silicon Prairie in the '80s and follows up to present day. Amazing show.

Lenny (01:19:24):
Halt and Catch Fire. Yeah, I watched some of it. I actually fell off of it, but it's a good reminder to go check it out.

Gustav Söderström (01:19:29):
Got to go back.

Lenny (01:19:30):
I'm going to go back. What's a favorite recent interview question you like to ask?

Gustav Söderström (01:19:34):
I don't ask it, but my favorite question is Lex Fridman's small ending question that is usually something like, so what's the meaning of it all? I like that. It's a tough question to get.

Lenny (01:19:46):
I'm so tempted to ask you, but-

Gustav Söderström (01:19:48):
No, don't.

Lenny (01:19:50):
Okay. Let's move on. That'll be another ... That'll be our second take at this.

Gustav Söderström (01:19:53):
Yes.

Lenny (01:19:55):
What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?

Gustav Söderström (01:19:58):
The obvious one is ChatGPT GPT-4 and just playing around with that, trying to create bots for yourself that do different things for you and so forth. But I don't think that's probably true for everyone. The other really favorite is something you've written about and talked about, which is Duolingo, which I think is both very impressive from a product point of view, the execution and what they've done. It is also insanely used in my family. We have a family account and everyone is using it and competing every day. So I'm both impressed by the product and I also use the product quite a lot.

Lenny (01:20:35):
What languages are folks learning within your family?

Gustav Söderström (01:20:38):
In my family, it's Spanish right now.

Lenny (01:20:41):
How's it going?

Gustav Söderström (01:20:41):
Bien.

Lenny (01:20:44):
You get a gold star.

Gustav Söderström (01:20:47):
I only have a few thousand XP. I'm not that good yet.

Lenny (01:20:51):
No, I don't know if that's good. That sounds pretty good. Next question, what's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that's had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute?

Gustav Söderström (01:21:01):
I'm not sure I've done anything minor that had a tremendous impact. Usually, it takes something bigger to get a big impact. I think maybe one thing that I've tried to do back to clarity and so forth is this thing I mentioned about I'm trying to push a lot for what I call Socratic debate, where the idea is obviously that the best idea wins, not the most senior idea and so forth. And trying to push for this notion of having people explain themselves, not saying I think there's something there or have a feeling or something like that. And apparently, as you said, that has had some impact because people apparently say that about me. So that's probably the biggest thing.

Lenny (01:21:53):
Final question, what is one fun ritual of the Spotify product team, and is it saunas?

Gustav Söderström (01:21:59):
So Spotify is so big now that it's quite local actually, different parts of Spotify, different product rituals. I accidentally created one ritual many years ago, maybe 12 years ago, when we talked about which phase a product is in. And it was ... We needed some definition. So I think off the cuff, I said, "Well, it's four phases." It's think it, build it, ship it, tweak it." And then the think it phase, it should be cheap, not a lot of money spent. In the build it phase, you're going to start spending a lot of money. So then you must have reduced the risk in the think it phase that you're right. And then you have the ship it phase and then you go over and tweak it. And it was something that wasn't that thought through, but it's funny because I still hear it sometimes even from other companies like, "Oh, we're in the think it phase," or "We're in the tweak it phase." So it stuck. I don't know if it's very good, but it's stuck.

Lenny (01:22:57):
It is catchy. I think anything getting stuck in people's head is a success. Gustav, thank you so much for being here. We are two for two for Swedish people. Gustaf, with an F, Alströmer was on the podcast.

Gustav Söderström (01:23:10):
Who is also an amazing person.

Lenny (01:23:12):
Also an amazing person. I feel very jealous of people that get to work with you and for you. Thank you again for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, maybe reach out, ask some questions.

Gustav Söderström (01:23:23):
[inaudible 01:23:23] @GustavS.

Lenny (01:23:24):
Okay. Say it again

Gustav Söderström (01:23:28):
@GustavS.

Lenny (01:23:29):
Awesome. And then final question is just how can listeners be useful to you?

Gustav Söderström (01:23:33):
Just reach out. I do read feedback and I try to remove the angry comments and understand what they're actually thinking and why they're upset or what's not working.

Lenny (01:23:44):
And then the reaching out, would you recommend an angry tweet at you or more of a email to that email address you shared?

Gustav Söderström (01:23:50):
Well, the @GustavS is the Twitter handle, so just tweet at me.

Lenny (01:23:54):
Okay.

Gustav Söderström (01:23:56):
You can be nice as well.

Lenny (01:23:57):
Okay.

Gustav Söderström (01:23:57):
It's okay.

Lenny (01:23:58):
Amazing. Gustav, thank you so much for being here.

Gustav Söderström (01:24:01):
Thank you for having me, Lenny. It's been a pleasure.

Lenny (01:24:03):

## Transcript

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:00):
Warren Buffett famously said, in business.

Audio (00:00:02):
I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:04):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle, you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
So in a lot of decks it's like, "Oh, we have the most amazing team. We move the fastest." You mention how rarely is that actually a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:20):
You're on a treadmill and if you stop running on that treadmill, you get creamed, but it's not power. The things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
Let's actually talk about achieving these powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:00:32):
There's a thing called power progression. There are times when certain types of power are available. The path to power is where the rubber meets the road.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):
Today my guest is Hamilton Helmer. Hamilton is a legend in the world of strategy. He's the author of 7 Powers, which outlines a framework for identifying and developing sustainable competitive advantage. It is widely considered to be the best book on strategy and people like Patrick Carlson, Peter Thiel, Reed Hastings, Daniel Eck, and so many more leaders credit the book and Hamilton's teachings for helping them build durable lasting companies. In our conversation, Hamilton shares what sources of power startups can start developing early, which types of power companies often think they have but they don't, how power relates to strategy and moats, when to start thinking about power as a startup and also what individual product managers and non-leaders can do about these insights about power. Also, how Hamilton sees AI impacting various entry and the sources of power. He also gives a preview of his new book that he's working on currently and so much more.

(00:01:40):

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:12):
Hi Lenny, a pleasure to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:14):
It's even more my pleasure. I want to start by talking about when power becomes important. When do you recommend founders start thinking about power in terms of pre-product market fit, post-product market fit? Is it worth spending time thinking about power early? Obviously it's good to think about a little bit, but how much and how seriously should founders be thinking about it before they found something that people actually want?

Hamilton Helmer (00:04:38):
One of the things that has really surprised me in the last five years has been that my understanding of the answer to that question has changed. And before I thought it was you do product market fit and then you do strategy, and if you try and put strategy before product market fit, it is not much you can do with it. That's wrong. Actually, I mentioned before one of the great pleasures for me in my work is being able to talk to company founders and one of the things that has surprised me is that conversations with them, even at an early stage about strategic matters have a richness and relevance to me that was unexpected.

(00:05:41):
And founders are practical people. I mean it's very hard to do what they're doing and they have to be extremely focused and choose what's worthwhile spending time on. And so in observing their reactions and that dialogue, I could see that there was something going on that was meaningful to them. And this second book we're working on, we'll tease out why that's so more, but the answer to your question is when should you thinking about this? The answer is always. And that's an odd answer. And so even before you have product-market fit, it's worth thinking about strategy. Now it's not strategy in the sense of this fully articulated strategic planning, we're going to do this, these are going to be the competitors, this is how we're going to answer them. This is how we'll price. Not like that at all. At the earlier stage, you can imagine wildly more degrees of freedom and the questions are of the business propositions that you're thinking of in trying to get to product-market fit, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?

(00:07:10):
And those actually are meaningful conversations and certainly by no means certain. You're tilting probabilities, you're not creating a determinative things. And then later on, once you've already have product-market fit, then you have to understand your source of power to understand what competitive position is because then you have to establish that. And then later on in a more stable phase when you're in a stability phase of business, you have to know what your source of power is if you have one, because you have to know how to defend it. And then also it is also the foundational knowledge that you need for if there's another step. Because another thing that's quite surprising about iconic businesses is they often have a second act or a third act or fourth act. I mean think of AWS or Intel going into CPUs or Apple going into iPhones, all not the origin of business. And that's actually common, not unusual, and that's starting the process all over again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:24):
Awesome. You mentioned this word strategy. I want to set a little foundation here. How does strategy relate to power when people are thinking about these two concepts? And then do you have just a nice definition of what strategy is? Everyone's always just like, "What the heck do you mean when you're talking about the strategy?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:08:41):
As I said, I'm a concept person and so when you develop concepts, you have to be very highly constrained by their usefulness. I'm a great fan of the great mathematician, John von Neumann, and he had a view which really irritated a lot of mathematicians, which is that if mathematics wasn't guided by what was useful, it would become, I think the word he used was aesthetic to aesthetic. And so any concept developments like that, it needs to be guided by usefulness. And so in dealing with strategy, the question is what domain of things do you want to include in that conversation? Because the term is ubiquitous in business. I mean do a Google search sometime. I've done one recently on Google Scholar for the word strategy and you'll get a million, I'm not exaggerating, a million hits. And so strategy for some people might mean everything that gets to the pile, it gets to the top of a pile in terms of what you have to do that year.

(00:09:58):
Everything is... And that's a perfectly legitimate definition, but what I have found is that there is a very important narrowing that makes it much more useful. So that's coming back to what I was saying [inaudible 00:10:17] makes it much more useful to the business. So my view is that you want to focus, it's very useful for a business to focus on the fundamental determinants of business value and that's an arbitrary choice. It could be something else, but I can tell you from decades of business experience that that narrowing is very useful. And then so once you make that... Once you reach that understanding, it tells you some important things. So if you understand what drives business value, I mean if you do the math of it right, it's NPV of cash flow, right? Expected cash flow. And what that tells you is that strategy is a long time concept. You're looking far out in the future.

(00:11:10):
So think of Pearl Harbor, Pearl Harbor for the Japanese was this enormous tactical success. They just destroyed the US ability, naval ability in the Pacific Ocean and the worst possible strategic move because it completely solved Franklin Delano Roosevelt's problem of how he could get the US citizens on board to attacking Hitler. The strategy of it was US's industrial might would eventually win the war and population. And the difference there is time constant, tactical short, strategy long. And so if you focus on value that narrows what you think about and allows you to get rather concise and offer up advice to founders about what they need to pay attention to.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
So then how specifically is power informing strategies? Like the way you think about it, focus on your power and that will inform your strategy?

Hamilton Helmer (00:12:17):
Earlier I talked about these economic structures that provide durability of return in terms of refuge from withering arbitrage of everybody who wants to eat your lunch. And so that's what power is. So you have to understand what is an economics? You're asking me questions that get pretty deep into theory or I hope you don't, this is too conceptual. But you have to say, you have to understand how competition takes place and say what is it that creates some kind of refuge? And what it is is there's something in what you do that gives you either a cost or price advantage over others. So let's say you're lower cost and that's the benefit. And the barrier side is that there's something that is durable about that that makes it over time that you can't, the competitors can't take away from you. So benefit and a barrier, we call it the to be or not to be test. And if you have that, you can think of that immediately translating into a value because that will give you good margins out into the foreseeable future, which is what you're after.

(00:13:44):
I don't know if that's... We're getting into the weeds here, but that's what it's about. And so power is those structures. Let me give you a quick example. So one I use in the book. So Netflix with scale economies, they have more subscribers. The cost of their content is a very large fixed cost, about 50% of their cost structure every year. They can take that fixed cost and spread it over more subscribers so their cost per subscriber is less versus somebody with fewer subscribers. So if they face the same prices for subscriptions as their competitors, they will be more profitable. And that's a scale economy and that's an example of a type of power and a common one I'd say. But these things are hard to achieve, right? Because there's the holy grail.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:47):
So let's actually talk about achieving these powers. Essentially the argument here is your power informs everything you do because this is the thing that'll allow you to stay durable and competitive and last. There's seven powers. We're not going to talk about all of them. If you want to go understand each of them, go read the book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:07):
Yeah. Let's not. That conversation always goes too long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):
Yeah, exactly. So what I'm wondering is, okay, so say you're looking at this list of seven powers and you're a specific type of startup, do you have a heuristic that tells you here's most likely the power and set of subsets that will most likely be an option for you? Like B2B SaaS companies, is there a smaller subset? Probably one of these has to be one of your options versus B2C.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:32):
That's a great question Lenny, because I think the path to power is where the rubber meets the road and it's very complicated and nuanced. But I'll give you a few thoughts along it and frankly our next book, the Second Invention, that's what it's about. It's about power, the entire book.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:56):
[Inaudible 00:15:56] I'll try to read it.

Hamilton Helmer (00:15:58):
So in a book there's a thing called power progression, which says there are... It tells over the cycle of a business, there are times when certain types of power are available and the converse of that is times when they're not available. And so there's some that only are really available in when you reach a stability phase of a business pretty far out there.

(00:16:25):
And so if you're starting a company, take those off the table. So those two are branding and process power. So often I find that there's a confusion about this because brand recognition for a startup may be incredibly important, but you can get brand recognition by buying an ad in the Super Bowl. That's not power, that you paid for it. So take branding and process power and process power is really operational excellence on steroids and usually is imitable, so it's usually not.

(00:17:05):
So take those off the table and then a resource type of power, which is you have something that is of value that if you transferred it to somebody else it would be of value to them, but you own the rights. So the barrier is law for example, or lack of knowledge from others. And there are classes of businesses that are like that. So prescription pharmaceuticals, if you are the first person to come up with Viagra, that's worth a lot of money. If you took that license and gave it to somebody else, it'd be worth a lot of money to them. But that's a different class and it's usually not the types of things that I'm dealing with and it's obvious to everybody. So the key challenge there is can you invent a pharmaceutical that's effective for a large market. So you can take those three off the table and that then leaves counter positioning, scale economies, switching costs and network economies.

(00:18:13):
And the important thing to keep in mind there is that they're sequenced. So almost every startup that you want to deal with starts with counter positioning because remember what product market fit is primarily is a substitution. You are coming up with a way to satisfy a more or less existing need in a novel way that creates more value. Now sometimes you tap into entirely new needs, but it's not so often. I mean Amazon was up against brick and mortar stores, Google was up against Yahoo and so on, and so you're usually substituting and that substitution, so your competition at that point is functional competition.

(00:19:19):
And if you don't have counter positioning at that point you're pretty high risk from an incumbent who already has the capabilities necessary to do that. They just have to extend their product or do this or that, but counter positioning is the refuge from that. And then you go into the other three types of power scale economies, switching costs and network economies, and those depend on your scale relative to competitors. This is pretty cursory, but that's what I'd say. I'll focus on those four and I would recommend that you think pretty hard about whether you think you have counter positioning to start.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:08):
Awesome. I actually want to double down on that thread, but just to summarize, I have the list here. Basically you're saying if you're an early stage startup, the four to really that are actually potential powers for you at least early on, counter positioning, which your point is you could just start with that. That's essentially positioning and business model design, which happens at the beginning and then you can start to think about network economy, scale economy, switching costs as powers.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:33):
Right. And you've done the right thing by not having me go through and define each of those. But your listeners will need to go back to my book and see what those things are to get... We're going through the shorthand as we should, but all of what we've said won't be completely obvious to them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:54):
Yeah, I think a simple Google search I find just gives you a very simple definition of these.

Hamilton Helmer (00:20:58):
Yeah, that's right. There's some people who have done some really good summaries of this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:02):
Or ChatGPT, even better in a lot of cases.

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:05):
ChatGPT if they get it right sometimes I find they hallucinate.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):
Hallucinate an eighth power. You mentioned how some companies think they have a certain power or it's common to think you have a certain power. If you look at every startup deck, there's always like, "Here's our moat, here's the way we're going to have barriers to entry." I'm guessing in almost every case they're delusional about the power that they actually have and the power they think they'll have. Do you also find that to be true that often founders are wrong about how much barrier they've actually created and is there a power you often find most wrong and mistaken?

Hamilton Helmer (00:21:43):
Yeah, so I agree with your observation, but I don't want to be unkind. So I mean there are two things to keep in mind here in terms of making people feel better about that incorrect slide in the deck. One is that founders have to be optimistic. I think it's an important quality that they maybe understate the risk a little bit, but they're so committed to I'm going to do this thing that they go through that and that may give them an advantage over a large corporation trying to do the same thing. The other is that despite the name 7 Powers, which makes it sound like, oh, you can sort this out. Actually understanding whether or not there is a type of power in place is hard. I mean I did it with my colleagues here at Strategy Capital and we're looking at a well-known company, it might take us weeks to answer that question for a single company.

(00:22:47):
And it comes down to the hard part is industry economics is what really are the economic relationships and it's very hard. So with those caveats that... Give them some courtesy, I'll say some of the obvious ones are I mentioned before, people sometimes think they have branding power, but another one that I think I've heard you mention is people often think that they get scale economies through data. And I'd say that that's possible, but it's rare. And the reason it's rare is not because there aren't scale economies in data, but rather that the range of scale that the existing competitors have are often large enough to be able to put them in shouting distance of each so that the differences in their cost per unit is not that great.

(00:23:50):
The curve flattens in other words, which is typical of any, because the most common scale economy is you've got a big fixed cost and you prorate that. And as you get more and more scale, the percentage cost advantage of a fixed cost advantage like that goes down and that often. So that's a pretty frequent one that we see. We laugh whenever we hear somebody say they have a flywheel, which gives you the idea of network economies. There are often flywheels, the ones that really are material, are rare. The key thing here is materiality, not whether the flywheel exists, but whether the effect is strong enough to really tilt returns.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
I was actually going to ask about that one because in software and social consumer products, network effects is always the pitch. Once we get big enough, we create this huge barrier. You mentioned just now you often find that's not actually true. It's rarely something that'll become a barrier. Is there anything else you find with network? And I know your power is called network economies, not network effect. I guess just to be clear, are these the same thing in your mind with different words?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:02):
Yeah, kind of. I mean I have called it a type of power. So for me it's only those things which clear the significance barrier, hurdle rather that they're a large material. And so there are lots of things that I would say have network effects but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:26):
Oh, interesting. Wait, can you speak to that? So there is a difference between these terms, network economies?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:30):
Yeah. So for me the difference is materiality is that whether the value benefit is large enough to engender a price delta significant enough to give you materially different margins into the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:50):
Basically, does that network effect have an actual impact on your business and your ability to price?

Hamilton Helmer (00:25:55):
Yeah, it's not an impact, it's a material impact. So it could have... If it's a penny to your bottom line, that's one thing if it's a billion dollars or something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:06):
Wow, that's actually really interesting. Is there an example of a company that comes to mind, they had network effects but not network economies as a power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:12):
I think you could turn almost anywhere and get some modest network effects and any platform business would probably likely have some modest network effects. You asked me earlier and you sent me about Uber and Lyft, I'd say that they probably have network effects involved but not network economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
Wow, that's interesting. And the reason you're saying they don't have network economies is because they're still so competitive they still have to spend so much money to stay ahead and so the network is not-

Hamilton Helmer (00:26:51):
Yeah. Right. The advantage that they get, it's not material. Right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Wow, that's so interesting. Along those lines, it's so interesting to see Uber and Lyft these days. In theory they both had some sort of strong network effect. I was just looking, so Lyft is 5% the market cap of Uber. Is there a lesson from just what it is that allowed Uber to just win and kind of run away with the market essentially?

Hamilton Helmer (00:27:25):
I'm not entirely sure, I'll take a guess, but take it as a unformed guess. I haven't really studied it carefully. I think that over time there, if I had to guess, I'd say they're probably modest scale economies in the business. And over time Uber has just very successfully played a war of attrition. And that's both been in how they run their... They made one initial misstep, which is they misdefined their business. They said it was international transportation and it's not. That business is extremely geographically specific.

(00:28:14):
If you have a great position in the Bay Area, it doesn't help you in London. And so their forays into China and everything really didn't make, but they pulled back on that, focused down on understanding their source of power, which was a geographically specific scale economy. And then they've done interesting things like Uber Eats where they've tried to utilize the platform that they have to get other opportunities for the one side of their platform, the drivers. And so if I had to guess, I'd say it was a well-played war of attrition with modest scale economies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):
And is that attrition coming from a source of power or is that just like a broader, more strict?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:06):
Yeah, it only works because there are modest scale economies. If there weren't any then if they did all this stuff, they'd still have a global and see.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:16):
Got it. Let me go in a slightly different direction. We've talked about power, we've talked about strategy. There's also, there's this word moat that comes up a lot. Everyone's always trying to build a moat. In your mind, is a moat equivalent to a power? Is there a difference when people talk about these two?

Hamilton Helmer (00:29:30):
Power requires a benefit and a barrier, you have to have something that you do that gives you a better outcome than your competitors, lower cost or higher price, and then something that makes it impossible for somebody else to mimic that. So moat is the second. So it's not synonymous with power because you can have a moat around a very undesirable piece of property and wouldn't get you far. But I think it is pretty synonymous with barrier. I think Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, I admire enormously. I think I get credit for popularizing those concepts and I think the way they think about it is good. I'd say that 7 Powers is probably more systematic and comprehensive in saying that. I don't think. This is wonderful. I don't know if you've read any of the Microsoft antitrust literature that came out of their-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):
No.

Hamilton Helmer (00:30:42):
...lawsuit, but there was a communication between Bill Gates and Warren Buffett where Warren Buffett was saying why he couldn't invest in Microsoft. He just didn't understand it. And so that meant the idea of network economies and what the moat was there he didn't understand. But I think the concept of a moat is a good one. The idea that you have something that gives you a refuge from competing forces.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):
In terms of Warren Buffett, I found the quote about moats. Warren Buffett famously said, "In business, I look for economic castles protected by unreachable moats."

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:22):
Right. And so he's taking care of the benefit part by saying a castle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:27):
Right. He's got it covered.

Hamilton Helmer (00:31:29):
But one of the tricks to understanding power is you have to have a pretty good understanding of why it's a castle and not a shack. So I'll give you a Netflix example. So a company I admire a lot, and I think if some of the things that they had to do to develop their business were so important for their business that don't guarantee a castle. So for example, UI development, it's been an enormous amount of resources on trying to get just the very best UI, I mean a zillion AB tests, all kinds of things. Their recommendation engine, everybody's knows the story about how that went, their interface with the content world and all this. So those things are important. They're things they have to spend a lot of time and resources on, but they can largely be mimicked.

(00:32:31):
So when Netflix in an earlier phase was fighting Blockbuster, when Blockbuster finally threw in the towel, said, "Well, we done. Well, better do a mail or a DVD business." If you look at the Blockbuster site, their UI site, you couldn't tell it different from Netflix. They just copied it. And so all that thoughtfulness about which things you put first and how you structure it and all that to make this suitable was mimicable. So that's an understanding of looking at the properties you have and trying to figure out if they're a castle or a shack.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:06):
I love that. This episode is brought to you by Paragon, the embedded integration platform for B2B SaaS product development teams. Are your users constantly requesting new integrations with other SaaS platforms that they use? Unfortunately, native product integrations take months of engineering to build and the maintenance never ends. Paragon enables your engineering team to ship integrations seven times faster than building in-house by removing the complexities around authentication, messy third-party APIs and debugging integration errors. Engineering teams at companies like CopyAI, Cinch, TLDB and over 100 other SaaS companies are using Paragon so they can focus their efforts on core product features, not integrations.

(00:33:53):
The results, their shipping integrations on demand, which has led to higher product usage, better retention and more customer upsells. Visit useparagon.com/Lenny to see how Paragon can help you go to market faster with integrations today. That's use paragon.com/Lenny. So let's take this concept of 7 Powers. A lot of people listening to this are just like individual contributor product managers on teams building new products or iterating on products they already have. What do you suggest they do with this knowledge of there exists these ways to build benefits and barriers? I'm working on say a new product. What do you recommend they do? What's something they could do this week, next month to infuse these lessons into the products they're building?

Hamilton Helmer (00:34:41):
I'd say they're a few and it's a little bit different. I'm not a great fan of the strategically driven organization because that idea, because it fuzzes over how this knowledge is useful at different stages in the business. And so for somebody in that position, say a product manager in an existing successful business. So it is important in terms of just understanding their business to know what their source of power is because they... And that can inform them about what it is that they're working for. And also they may see things since they're down in the weeds, they may see things that are important to that that they need to bring to other people's attention. Because they're the ones that really have the knowledge of what the heck's going on. There's another aspect I mentioned before, this idea of transforming, of starting up entirely new things. And usually... I wouldn't say, usually I say it's not uncommon for ideas about that to bubble up from down below.

(00:36:03):
And so that's another source. So let's separate a business into three phases, origination, takeoff, and stability. So the answers I've given are more in the stability phase. In the takeoff phase, let's say you've launched a product, you've gotten customer traction, now you're in a phase where there's just very rapid growth, probably other entrants like you, what are you facing? What you're facing is remember that underneath all of this is a change in technology. That's what made the product market fit possible in the first place. But that doesn't just stop. That if you're in a technology wave, often there are all kinds of offshoots both for you and the compliments to your business and everything else going on at the same time.

(00:36:59):
And to win at that stability phase, which is really a market share win, you have to be aware of those and understand, okay, we have to incorporate this new feature. Or maybe now things have gotten to the point where this new market segment is, our product is attractive before it wasn't. This is meat and potato stuff for somebody at that level and it may well be the decisive element in terms of whether you win that market share battle with the other contenders. And so you have a very, very important role at that point. And so I'd say the first thing to do with your question is to make sure you think about the different phases of this and then ask what those responsibilities are.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:51):
What about for people that are just trying to get better at being strategic, thinking strategically something every product leader is always encouraged to do, become a better strategic thinker, build as muscle of strategy, what do you often advise to people just get better at the stuff? Obviously read your book.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:09):
Read the book, and then have conversations with your colleagues about the topic because as you internalize what that means and how, have conversations with them about do we really have this kind of power? What's going on here? What's important? What isn't. Those conversations tend to allow you to get a better grip on things. I mean in the case of Netflix, Reed actually had me come in and train the top a hundred people in Netflix and strategy. We actually ran classes in the company, but that's unusual I'd say. And I didn't have the book yet. And so I think the book gets people pretty far down that path already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:55):
And you don't do that anymore, I imagine if someone wanted to do that today, not an option.

Hamilton Helmer (00:38:59):
I sadly don't have the time. I mean I do often do fireside chats at company meetings and that kind of thing, but not a full-blown course and I'm not teaching at Stanford anymore either. And so I don't. I enjoyed that immensely wonderful people to work with. But sadly I don't have the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):
You're about to get a lot of requests for fireside chats. I hope you're ready. You mentioned AI at some point in our chat. I'm curious how you think AI is going to change your 7 Powers framework. Do you think defensibility goes down in general? Will certain forms of power become more important or harder to achieve? How do you think about AI?

Hamilton Helmer (00:39:44):
Yeah, it's a great question. I mean we're all in this phase of wondering exactly how generative AI is going to play out. My own view, currently I don't see any change in seven powers from it in terms of an eighth power or something. But the issues that it brings up, like scale economies, I mean think of scale economies. If you have a fixed cost of trying to develop a model of a billion dollars or something or network effects, will AI models develop so that they learn in a way that for one user's interaction helps another user's interaction? That would be a powerful network economy. Or if it learns, if you think of if it learns about you and becomes a better psychiatrist or something, then that's a switching cost. So all these things are relevant to which business models will work and I find that useful.

(00:40:51):
But I think in general, the way I think about it is it's a standard form of potentially very powerful technology that is being introduced into the business world and just asking how that plays out. I currently tend to think of that there's three types of plays. There's the company that's the technology play itself. So if you think of microprocessors, it would be Intel. There's the companies that wouldn't exist without the technology. So for semiconductors it would be Microsoft. And then there are the companies that utilize the technology, but it had existed before and after. So for semiconductors it would be automobiles. They used a ton of chips, but there were still cars before, after.

(00:41:48):
And so I'm of the view, I'm very much uncertain at this point that generative AI, its biggest impact will be that tertiary class. It will be used in a lot of things that existed before and exist after, but are made better by it like semiconductors and automobiles. And so it reminds me, if you think of really big technology shifts like this, it reminds me of electricity. When electricity came, you could completely reconfigure a factory floor. You no longer had to have... You could have the power source essentially at the operating unit of an operator. But that took a lot of redesign, incorporation, investment, learning, complements, all kinds of stuff. I tend to think this will be more like that. There will be some pure cases. People will want to have them write their term paper with ChatGPT or something. But if you think of businesses, it's hard for me to think of a single functional area in a business that with redesign couldn't benefit. So accounting, HR, R&D all have uses of this but requires incorporation, which is always troublesome.

(00:43:30):
And so that's my view. But there certainly will be businesses that couldn't exist without it. And there's some that are coming up and some of those are in fact the businesses that empower the tertiary need, they're the ones that bring in. But if you go back, this will date me, but if you go back into business history, back in, I guess it was the 90s, there was this thing called business process re-engineering, the idea that you could take a computer sensibility into business processes, redesign them and get these monstrous cost savings. And it was a gigantic consulting opportunity for people. Whole companies got developed based on that and it feels more like that to me, but it's very interesting. I could be wrong, but it feels different than crypto. It feels like there's more of a real ultimate use case. I mean, if it really is true what they say that a 50% improvement in programming efficacy is not uncommon, just that proposition alone is worth an awful lot of money if you think how many programmers are in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):
No question. You mentioned eighth power. I just want to check, is there an emerging eighth power you wish you maybe would've included or maybe added in the future that's like, "Oh, maybe this is on the edge," or it's like, "Nope, we got these seven?"

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:15):
It's a great question. I'm always looking for it because if you find it it probably means it's so obscure there, it'll also be a great investment opportunity. We're looking all the time, but so far, no. So far I'm pretty satisfied that seven is an exhaustive set, but never say never. That's an empirical seven, not a theoretical seven.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):
If we start seeing you making incredible returns, you've clearly found an eighth power [inaudible 00:45:41]-

Hamilton Helmer (00:45:41):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):
I want to close one thread on a power that you mentioned that is often a pitfall, which is around process power and basically execution. A lot of people think so in a lot of decks it's like, oh, we have the most amazing team, we move the fastest, we're earliest. You mentioned how rarely is that actually a power actually being able to execute and create a process that is an actual barrier? Can you just talk a bit more about that to help people understand okay, it's probably not our power?

Hamilton Helmer (00:46:09):
One of the great thinkers in strategy was this Harvard professor Michael Porter, and he in probably 40 years ago, made the very controversial statement that operational excellence is not strategy. He got a lot of people of the Harvard Business School faculty really mad at him because that's what their careers were about and it sounded like he was dissing them. But the point he was making was when you get to this end state, if you already have power that things that drive operational excellence can be mimicked because you can hire a consulting firm who has best practices, knowledges that come in and get you up to snuff. You can hire people from your competitors who know how to do it better. And that's true, but it's also true in this takeoff phase in a business that we talked about before, when you're trying to attain competitive position, operational excellence is everything.

(00:47:14):
And so if you think of strategy, not statically endpoints like Professor Porter was, but if you look at dynamically how you get there, operational excellence is essential for a strategy. So think of those things I mentioned before about Netflix, about their UI and recommendation engine and so on, or international rollout, all those things. They were in a battle to get more subscribers than other people and those were critical for that. But in themselves, they're critical in attaining competitive position, but in themselves, they're not sources of power typically, unless there's some very tight considerations here or very demanding considerations for the... Unless if they have to be material, but they also have to be opaque or some way people can't easily imitate them. Either they don't understand what's going on or they might be opaque. So for example, think of TSMC. So when they put up the latest fab and get that operational, are there a lot of steps in doing that?

(00:48:43):
They know how to do with their staff is trained to do it, but it's not documented necessarily and you can't imitate it. Then maybe they have it. I don't know if they have process power or not, but it takes that level of complexity. In my book, I use the example of Toyota and a car manufacturing is complex enough that you can have this opacity in terms of material steps, but it's not common. So if you're in a stability phase of business, you're stuck with this funny thing, which is most of your day is on those issues and it should be because if you don't do it, a competitor can and they can end up better than you. And so you're on a treadmill and that's the way business is. That's fine. And if you stop running that treadmill, you get creamed. So you got to do it, it's most of your day, but it's not power. And there are those rare cases where it's so material and so inimitable that it can be power, but they're rare.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:02):
I like the heuristic that if you haven't written it down or you can't describe it, that might be a sign that maybe process power is a power of yours.

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:13):
Yeah. And there isn't a consulting firm that offers to bring you up to speed on that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:20):
They'll make you more like Amazon as a service. Kind of along these same lines, you talk about how the only things that create value in a company are power, market size and operational excellence. And I think hearing that will blow a lot of people's minds because they think there's so many things that contribute to the value of a company and you whittle it down to these three things. What can you say about that insight?

Hamilton Helmer (00:50:47):
So I'd say they're right and I'm right. They're right because there are this incredible... I mean business is really hard and there are just a multitude of things you have to pay attention for. I'm right because all those things fall into those three categories. So it's an exhaustive set and it simply comes out of the math. So we're both right I'd say.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):
Final question, the intent of a lot of your work is to empower founders. I'm curious if you've noticed any broad economic trends or shifts that you think will make life easier or harder for founders in the coming years?

Hamilton Helmer (00:51:32):
Personally, I am very, very concerned about the debt trajectory of the United States and of many countries around the world, but I'll pick on the United States, but it's a trend going on everywhere. We're on a trajectory for this extremely high indebtedness. And so if you think about the last 30 years, right? There's been a crisis about once every 10 years. So there's the dot-com bust, there's the financial crisis, there was COVID. Nothing makes me think that the frequency will be a lot less. I don't know what, who knows? These are all uncertain events. But imagine if we got to one of those and we had no dry powder and dry powder for us is the ability to heavily deficit spend take on debt. And fortunately our government did that in both the financial crisis and in COVID. And because that people had jobs. My own view about the financial crisis is that if we hadn't done that, plus having Ben Bernanke as the head of the Fed, we would've gone into another great depression.

(00:52:52):
It was that ugly. So this current debt trajectory, you don't know how long it will take exactly when, but eventually that will mean we will not have dry powder. People will not respect the credit worthiness of this country. So that worries me a lot. And it utterly will affect the idea of company founding because if you get into a crisis like that, the capital markets lock up and it gets very difficult to do anything. And to really stretch my credibility here, I'll opine on just how hard a problem this is to solve. The reason this is so difficult for this country to solve and other countries is that it is right at the crux of the delicate dance between capitalism and democracy. So if you think about the problem, of course that's driving all this is entitlements. There's discretionary spending, certain recovery programs and stuff, but those can go away. The underlying trend that people just can't get their arms around is entitlements. And anybody who looks at the numbers can see that. Every economist knows that. But that's not an easy fix.

(00:54:18):
And the reason it's not an easy fix is there are two opposing views of what's going on, and there's no way to resolve those two views. One is that capitalism is rapacious and results in more and more inequality and the government has to do something about it. And the other is that the government is on a path that is creeping socialism that will undermine our freedom and economic sufficiency. And the poster child for the rapacious capitalism. One is, I don't know if you've seen the recent analysis of inequality in the United States just came out, much more robust analysis. And it said that basically inequality in the last 60 years of the United States is unchanged, but that's post-transfer, post-tax inequality, which basically says the amount of taxing and transferring going on was about right. So it says that the amount we're spending is about right from that perspective, that it compensates for the other inequities and we should be spending that much so we should tax more.

(00:55:30):
And the poster child for the other point of view of the dangers of government is the steadily increasing without interruption percentage of the economy that is government. And to levels that 75 years ago, people would've thought absolutely impossible. So there are these two views about what's going on. One is that we're compensating for the normal inequities of capitalism, and the other is that we're headed down a path to socialism and ruin. And that leads to a deadlock, which is you don't tax anymore and you don't cut spending and that leaves deficits. So anyway, a long, long rant, sorry but that trend is extremely politically difficult to deal with and extremely threatening and that concerns me immensely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:32):
Not to leave listeners with a very sad state of affairs.

Hamilton Helmer (00:56:36):
Yeah, sorry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:37):
No, no. I think this is important. I think it's important people think about this and know these things. Is there anything that gives you hope? Is there anything that gets you excited about either for founders or anyone in general, just to leave folks with maybe on a happy?

Hamilton Helmer (00:56:50):
Yeah, I mean, I am an optimist really in a way, and I do. There's a famous Austrian and eventually American economist named Joseph Schumpeter who wrote this wonderful book Theory of Economic Development way back when over a hundred years ago, where he took the unusual view of saying that the vitality of an economy depended on entrepreneurs. And I ascribe to that. I think that creativity and action are the ways society and people advance. And I think the US's and a free society has huge advantages in that. And I think that I feel very lucky to be in a place I'm in Silicon Valley, but to be in a place in a country where that is vital and active and I think that's ground zero for me. And so I think you see that alive and well, I think. And there are people that are very Enthusiastic about that as I am.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:12):
Beautiful way to close out our chat. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything you want to leave listeners with or any last tidbit of advice?

Hamilton Helmer (00:58:22):
I alluded to it before, but just that remember, action is the first principle of business. You do stuff and my book is very oriented towards that. The idea was not to tell you what to do, but to give you guideposts while you're on that journey. People that are enthused about it, I encourage you to do stuff. That's where it all starts and I can think about it and maybe help a little bit, but it's mostly doing stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):
I love that point so much. It was something I was going to touch on but I didn't get to is just there's so many people that just sit around and theorize about a strategy of their business, especially in their early stage. Here's our grand master plan, here's an amazing strategy or just read about startup ideas and don't actually try it. I love this final note of just try it. Just do it. Don't just sit there and-

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:18):
Yeah, yeah, just do it. And life is full of surprises. You'll end up in a place you didn't expect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):
Amazing. Speaking of ending up in a place you didn't expect, it's time for our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:32):
Oh, sure. I'll do my best here. I'm not very good on lightning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:37):
First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Hamilton Helmer (00:59:42):
One book that is extremely wonky, and I can only take it in very small doses, but is magnificent, is one called The Road to Reality by Roger Penrose, who's this brilliant mathematician. And it will be very daunting for anybody unless you're a deep math person, but his brilliance in erudition just shines through in this thing. And it's an amazing book. I would say there's another book, boy, I wish I could remember the name. Maybe you can get the name of the author called Gene by this geneticist. And I think he's a Harvard Medical School professor that's about the history of genetics and he is an absolutely luminous writer. I mean, it puts me to shame. I'm embarrassed when I read it because I think how pedestrian my writing is and incredibly knowledgeable about the history of genetics and I think that's such an important topic. So those are two that I would recommend highly, fairly wonky, but I like them both.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):
I love them. The author, I just looked him up. Siddhartha Mukherjee.

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:01):
Yes. Just amazing. You read it and you go, "How did he think of that phrasing?" I mean, it's just, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:14):
I'm a huge movie fan and have been all my life, and I'm particularly keen on animated films. But the movie that I've recently seen that I liked particularly it was American Fiction. I thought that was... It didn't make any of the easy choices in a movie and as a result was just incredibly interesting and thoughtful I thought.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:39):
Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?

Hamilton Helmer (01:01:43):
In my office, just this last week, we actually put a Persian rug in our entry room, and this is what's called a Farahan Sarouk rug and it's 150 years old. And it had an effect in me that I didn't expect, which is it is a work of great beauty. And it was before, it was all hand-done before machines. You get all this wonderful variation of the actual icons in the rug and the different dye colors. And I find that every morning when I walk in, I go, "That's really beautiful," and it's uplifting and it shows you the importance of, or the value of the quality of art. I mean, just blows my mind actually. So that's probably not the usual product discussion that you get.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:50):
No, I love that answer. Recently we've had some really unique choices. One is a very nice Mercedes and a Rivian and a minivan recently. We've got a lot of very nice things.

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:00):
Oh, that's great. I'm a car guy too, so I didn't answer on the car question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):
Oh man, I love that. We have Rory Sutherland coming on the podcast soon. He is one of the leaders of Ogilvy and he has a whole thing about how buying a home is the best value of art to buy art if you live in a home that makes you feel inspired and is beautiful.

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:20):
Yeah, I'm a big believer in that. I mean, I think that your place and how you connect to it has an important grounding effect. And then before I talked earlier about creativity and I think surrounding yourself in an environment that stimulates that is really important. And so I couldn't agree with him more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:51):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to share with friends or family?

Hamilton Helmer (01:03:58):
One is what Clint Eastwood's advice to actors, which is don't just do something, stand there. And so there are a lot of things that are long-termish with low signal to noise. And you can often just do a lot of stuff that you think makes a difference, but it really doesn't. And so that's one. The other one which is somewhat more profound I think was one that I had a famous Sri Lankan journalist was a mentor of mine and very dear friend, and he had a favorite expression that I adhere to all the time, which is everything is always about something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
Wow. Deep.

Hamilton Helmer (01:04:53):
And that's so true if you're dealing with this power stuff when if you really dig down, everything is always about something else.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:58):
Speaking of power, final question. People that have a lot of power are leaders in the world. I'm curious, do you have a favorite historical leader?

Hamilton Helmer (01:05:07):
So yeah. I have some that I admire a great deal. I'm a tremendous fan of Winston Churchill's. Most really great people are quirky and he qualified. There are things you could say about him that you might not have liked that so much, but he was a genius and had great fortitude, human sense. He understood things long before other people. I've give him high marks. Some of the great artists I admire enormously. I'm reading a book right now on the last 20 years of Michelangelo, which wonderful book actually, and which is a very interesting period because in his first 70 years he finished up all that, he wasn't going to do sculpture anymore. He just finished The Last Judgment, which was the wall of the Sistine Chapel.

(01:06:08):
And I think the last major fresco he did. And a lot of his friends at that time, he was exiled from Florence and living in Rome and he had this Roman community and a lot of his close friends that had recently died or had difficulties. So he's at this inflection point in his life at 70, which in those days was very old, and yet he went on to do some of the most remarkable architecture in the history of the world. And so you've got to admire that. I mean, just doing that, which is that rare second act. But I think for world leaders, Winston Churchill is very high. I'm a fan of Teddy Roosevelt, I must say too, in this country.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):
I love that. Hamilton, you are wonderful. I feel like we have helped a lot of people up-level their ability to think about strategy and moats and power. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find more online if they want to dig in further, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Hamilton Helmer (01:07:15):
Yeah, so as I say, I'm an idea person and I'm about trying to empower company founders, and so only thing I can say is read the book, spread the ideas, start your own company. Those are the things that would make me happy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):
Amazing. Hamilton, Thank you so much for being here.

Hamilton Helmer (01:07:40):
Great. My pleasure, Lenny.

# LinkedIn’s product evolution and the art of building complex systems | Hari Srinivasan (LinkedIn)

## Transcript

Hari Srinivasan (00:00:00):
It was March 2020 and we were just watching COVID hit. It was just this heartbreaking moment where in the feed you were seeing all these people, by no fault of their own, starting to post that they've lost their job. We started seeing in our data is you had some areas like maybe hospitality was really getting hit, but some areas like customer service that just couldn't hire enough. You'd think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly. You'd think, okay, maybe these people will start moving to other jobs, but it wasn't happening.

(00:00:24):
A large reason behind this, people are used to looking for certain particular titles, and they didn't start realizing other people could do this job. We made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system. I think that the job market is rebalancing, but it's being done, the pathways are being done in a very different way that seems to be maybe a change that holds through these ups and downs. That'll be very interesting to see.

Lenny (00:00:57):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Hari Srinivasan. This episode has a hilarious story.

(00:01:11):
On Twitter, an account called The Curious PM tagged me with a request to have someone from LinkedIn come on the podcast and talk about how they operate and what they've learned about building products that serve so many different types of customers. I replied asking for any suggestions for who he thought I should specifically talk to, and he suggested Hari Srinivasan, by doing some research on LinkedIn. I reached out to Hari, told him about this tweet and he agreed. Here's the episode.

(00:01:39):
Hari's been at LinkedIn for eight-and-a-half years and he leads the Talent Solutions Product Team as VP of product, which is also LinkedIn's biggest business, and includes all of the hiring and learning products, which you'll hear about in this episode. In our chat, Hari shares what he's seeing change in the hiring market, what you can do to improve your odds of finding a job through LinkedIn, what he's learned about building and maintaining really complex systems like LinkedIn, tips for getting into product management, and some lessons from his own course on product management. Plus, we also talk about how LinkedIn has been able to become a real source of valuable content and a lot less cringe over the past couple years, which I've definitely noticed and I share in our chat.

(00:02:20):
What a fun series of events that led to this episode. Big thank you to Jatin, hopefully, I'm pronouncing your name correctly, the guy behind the Curious PM account, for making this all happen. With that, I bring you Hari Srinivasan after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:35):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing-up template, that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team.

(00:03:05):
I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wire frames, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's miro.com/lenny.

(00:03:45):
Today's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage.

(00:04:11):
Brave Search is the fastest-growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave Browser. If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges.

(00:04:38):
The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web-scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.

(00:05:04):
How are you? Welcome to the podcast.

Hari Srinivasan (00:05:06):
Thanks for having me. Been a big fan for a long time.

Lenny (00:05:09):
I really appreciate that. What a fun story behind this conversation. Let me just ask you, how did you feel when I cold-DMed on LinkedIn, asking you to be on this podcast because of a random tweet?

Hari Srinivasan (00:05:20):
I felt very honored. Again, I really have followed your work for a while. It's been really amazing to see what you've built, and I'm a huge fan of different builders. Also, it was a little bit of an honor that someone ... I know we're going to get into the story in a little bit. When you work on something, oftentimes jobs and learning, it's rare I think that it's in the influencer conversation. It's not necessarily something you or other people are properly experiencing on day-to-day. Sometimes, I don't know if we get to tell some of these stories, and I really appreciate you reaching out for that.

Lenny (00:05:50):
Yeah. Absolutely. I guess let me just give a big thank you to Jatin Rajvanshi, also known as The Curious PM, who tweeted about this concept and then is like, "Hey, talk to Hari about LinkedIn." Thank you, Jatin, for making this happen. It was all thanks to you. Usually, when this happens, someone tweets a recommendation of someone, they know each other. I'm like, "Eh, I don't know. This is some promotion of some other person." But you guys don't know each other, right?

Hari Srinivasan (00:06:15):
We don't, no. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Thank you, again, for putting in the word.

Lenny (00:06:20):
Absolutely. Also, thank you to Jatin for recommending a bunch of questions that I'm going to ask you.

Hari Srinivasan (00:06:26):
That I didn't know. Maybe I should've known. That I didn't know. Thanks, again, Jatin. It's very kind of you.

Lenny (00:06:32):
Yeah. Okay. Let's roll into some stuff. I actually want to start with LinkedIn as a platform broadly. I know you don't work on all parts of LinkedIn and don't necessarily know everything that's going on there, but something I've noticed that's pretty major is, it feels like LinkedIn's really made this move from being a very cringey place to post and spend time to, it's actually now interesting.

(00:06:55):
The feed that I see on LinkedIn is interesting. Oftentimes even more interesting than Twitter, which is crazy to say. Also, it's become the biggest source of traffic for my newsletter, more so than Twitter, which I never expected. My question is, as far as you know, what is it that y'all did right in the past couple years that has allowed for this shift to happen? Because this is very rare.

Hari Srinivasan (00:07:18):
Well, first, I'm glad you're having a good experience with it. That's really, really kind to here. First of all, it's very interesting you hit on it. Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem. One of the things that we always think about is how the whole system fits together. I'm sure we'll get into it more and more about how we build at LinkedIn, but how you make decisions based on the very complicated ecosystem is actually not very difficult because we're all here to help people connect to economic opportunity. Every time there's a discussion, something I'm really, really proud about working here is, everyone knows how that decision is going to be made. It's all about how we're connecting people to economic opportunity.

(00:07:55):
Now, it's funny. Just the other day, I was driving. I was in an Uber with the person who runs a feed. He's this guy, Kamesh, who's just phenomenal. We were just talking about this and one of the things he mentioned to me was, "If you think about what a feed is when it connects someone to opportunity, it's got to do a couple of things really, really well." We've done a ton of member surveys on this, a ton of thought behind it. The first is, as you make relationship connections across the way, that is a real way by which people get opportunity. They keep in touch with those people. They learn they might follow someone, and hopes in getting knowing them and getting that knowledge. We got to make sure that that content is getting to them.

(00:08:29):
Then, when you think outside the network, we have to make sure that the things that people really want, which they keep saying are knowledge and advice and ability to get the real perspectives they need to get there, those are the things out of network they want. We've really, really been focused on driving those two systems. How does someone connect to opportunity both through the people and through the content that they actually want? As you know, when you do a feed, there's so many decisions that go into that complex system, so many decisions. But we've been really, really trying to make sure that we don't lose sight of that and start tuning all those knobs into that direction.

Lenny (00:09:04):
If we're trying to get even more specific with what has changed, clearly there's been a focus internally. Is that true? There's just like, "Hey, let's make this feed a lot more interesting"? Or is this just a never ending and then it's actually started to work investment as far as?

Hari Srinivasan (00:09:19):
Well, there's always been a focus on connecting people to opportunity. There's always been a focus on that. I think what's happened over time is we've gotten more and more clear with what our members really want, which is this ability to feel close to those relationships and the ability to really get that knowledge that they need. As we've gotten better and clear in that understanding and we've been able to dial the knobs in the right way, I hope it's landing in the right place. I don't think it's any place near declaring victory in any part of this product.

(00:09:46):
I think one of the beauty of working with that vision of connecting people to opportunity, there is always some piece of friction. There is always something we could be doing better. I'm always hesitant to say we've ever hit that bar, and I know there's probably people who listen to you who probably maybe have not had that experience. I always encourage you to reach out and let us know ways we can do better. But I'm glad you're having an experience with it. And then to your point, I always feel that as long as we stay focused on that and each of our decisions start moving in that direction, hopefully the product will continue to deliver.

Lenny (00:10:14):
Do you know if there's any product changes that have most contributed to that feed becoming much more interesting?

Hari Srinivasan (00:10:21):
Well, there's a couple of things that I think are very special that we're working on and it's hard to say which is most, because a lot of these things obviously accumulate and compound over time. But certainly, there's a lot of machine learning and algorithms that go behind these systems. Many of them, as we start understanding that these are things that people get value by, it's about how do we make sure that we're giving people that interesting knowledge? As we've gotten crisper on what that means, I think we've been better able to build towards it.

(00:10:50):
The other one, which is new, but I'm just particularly excited about, we're starting to do a lot of things which are gen AI-assisted. You basically can come in and get some prompts and people can bury their perspective on that. I think that combination, it's very early, but it's very exciting on how we might be able to help people unlock knowledge. There's almost a billion people now on the platform, knowledge of those billion people in a way that people can find and see.

Lenny (00:11:12):
Awesome. Again, I know this isn't the area you spend all your time on, but maybe one more question along these lines.

Hari Srinivasan (00:11:18):
Yeah, please.

Lenny (00:11:19):
Yeah. Do you have any sense of the kind of content that works best on LinkedIn in terms of the algorithm you talk about? The algorithm is probably one of the bigger impact things that have changed.

Hari Srinivasan (00:11:29):
If there's anything with knowledge or advice, I think that's what a lot of people are looking for. Every time we run these surveys, every time we talk to people on what they want, those are the things that really when you connect opportunity that people seek after in our system. You're a great example of that. You're able to give knowledge and advice in an area with a lot of depth. I think that maybe that's why you're having some of the success you're seeing on the platform, which is wonderful to see.

Lenny (00:11:53):
I think I'm actually not getting as much success as I could because I don't put in the time. I usually just post a simple thing with a link and I think I could be, if I really ... I just don't have time to do this of just like, post a lot more stuff within the actual post. I think that would do better.

Hari Srinivasan (00:12:09):
That actually makes me happy. My guess is what you want to be doing is learning and creating and not spending a lot of time managing. Maybe that's actually a good thing. It's actually another wonderful thing to hear.

Lenny (00:12:20):
Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Let's move to your sweet spot, which is the talent solution product? Is that what it's called?

Hari Srinivasan (00:12:29):
Yeah. It's basically any product on LinkedIn that helps you get a job or learn a skill. We have products for recruiters and hires, jobs. We have products for job seekers. We have LinkedIn Learning and then certainly, we run a pretty large creator ecosystem for instructors who post content into LinkedIn Learning.

Lenny (00:12:47):
Is it true that this is the biggest business within LinkedIn?

Hari Srinivasan (00:12:50):
It is a very big business between LinkedIn. It's certainly hopefully something that, again, if you go back to that vision of connecting people to opportunity, it's certainly something that I like to think is very, very core to that, how people get jobs and learn skills.

Lenny (00:13:04):
The feed gets all the glory and you guys are making all the money?

Hari Srinivasan (00:13:07):
I would not say that, but again, we joke about those things. It's so hard at LinkedIn to separate one product from the other. It's really the way we run. It's the way we think about the product. It's really the way we build. Let me just give you a super concrete example of that. Certainly, if you have someone coming in and looking at the feed, one thing we might do is suggest a job recommendation based on what they're looking for in that feed. Part of what we have to do is think about how someone who's looking at something in their interest might be driving their job-seeking experience as well.

(00:13:38):
And then when they're looking for a job, it's very important that they know how they can actually get connected in that job. The relationship, the network you build are very much part of that flywheel that go into it. And then even as we start looking at this, you might be looking at a subject and then you want to go deeper on, and there's a course that comes into it as well. All of this to me is a very, very connected ecosystem on how those items work together in order to give people opportunity. We might think of it from the outset as very different things, but inside, even the way we operate and the way we think about it, it's a very, very connected ecosystem.

Lenny (00:14:15):
What are the components again of this part of the org?

Hari Srinivasan (00:14:18):
We think about it as two different marketplaces. There's a hiring marketplace, which is, how do we connect job seekers and recruiters and hiring managers? And then there's a learning marketplace, which is, how do you connect learners to instructors?

Lenny (00:14:29):
Got it. And then within hiring, are there subcomponents?

Hari Srinivasan (00:14:33):
Yeah. Again, we really think about it as a marketplace. We're generally organized around seekers and hires. There's a team that's working on a Recruiter, which is probably one of the more flagship products that LinkedIn has always been around, a team working on jobs, which is, if you ever post a job on LinkedIn, and then a team working to always help job seekers make sure they connect. And then on the other side for learners, instructors, the team working on LinkedIn Learning, which is one of the bigger enterprise learning products in the world. And then a team working to help instructors.

(00:15:02):
Many people don't know this. We actually have two large film studios. We bring in instructors. We film a lot of content. One's in Europe and one's in Santa Barbara. It was all started with the Lynda acquisition. We have a large team of content creators and teams, everyone from makeup artists to script writers, that we get to use over there.

Lenny (00:15:22):
Wow. It's just marketplaces all the way down as you talk about this. Hiring marketplace, learning marketplace, the feed itself. Probably more I'm not thinking about.

Hari Srinivasan (00:15:31):
Yeah. It's very much the one model that we sometimes use internally as well is, how do we operate as marketplaces inside an ecosystem? I think it speaks to the complexity again of the product and hopefully somehow of how we might operate it.

Lenny (00:15:46):
I think with your vantage point at being at the center of hiring, a lot is changing within the hiring marketplace in the past, I don't know, year at this point, where it used to be very candidate-oriented, where they had all the power and they salaries were crazy. Everyone's bidding and trying to get people to join their company. Now, it's completely opposite. So many people looking, companies have all the power. I'm curious what you've seen, if that's roughly it, or what you're seeing basically in the hiring market these days.

Hari Srinivasan (00:16:15):
Yeah. Well, first of all, the balance that you're talking about, it is shifting in the sense that there are more seekers in the marketplace now and there are fewer open jobs in the marketplace. Of course, that changes how many applications you get for the job and how you have to look through. I think there's a model where people think it's drifting dramatically to exactly the way it was. I actually think some of the changes that occurred during the last couple of years are actually sticking around. Let me give you a couple examples of where things I think are really changing.

(00:16:44):
The first thing that happened was, and maybe in my opinion, one of the big changes to the world that no one's really talking about it to my degree is the impact of it, but there's been a real move to skills-based hiring. For the longest time, and I'll give you actually a really concrete example, it was March 2020 and we were just watching COVID hit. It was just this heartbreaking moment where in the feed you were seeing all these people, by no fault of their own, starting to post that they've lost their job.

(00:17:09):
We started seeing in our data is you had some areas like maybe hospitality was really getting hit, but some areas like customer service that just couldn't hire enough. You'd think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly. You'd think, okay, maybe these people will start moving to other jobs, but it wasn't happening. A large reason behind this, people are used to looking for certain particular titles, and they didn't start realizing other people could do this job.

(00:17:31):
We made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system. But instead of saying, "I need to have this talent," you can say, "I need someone who can do negotiation, and I need someone who can really help me understand how to deescalate a customer situation."

(00:17:54):
You find a lot of people in hospitality have about 70% of the skills you need for customer service and of course, you could train off the rest. We started seeing the skills-first hiring really start taking off. At this point, roughly 47% of our recruiters will come in, explicitly use skills when they start looking for candidates. That's a pretty big change that we're actually seeing hold. I know it's early in some of these changes, but it's a change where I think people are still continuing to start looking at skills.

(00:18:20):
Another one was this concept of, there's a lot more people who are starting to look for jobs by values. They were saying, "Look, most job sites work by you come in and you look for a job and a title, and that's how you navigate the world." We started realizing a lot of people wanted to come in and instead of look at it like that, they may say, "Look, I really want a job. This aligned with my purpose." Or even by an interest, I may want something in AI. We started launching collections in the way to filter in these things. We're still seeing some of that usage today.

(00:18:47):
I think that the job market is rebalancing, but it's being done, the pathways are being done in a very different way that seems to be maybe a change that holds through these ups and downs. That'll be very interesting to see.

Lenny (00:18:58):
What's interesting is it's not like this would change on its own. You're the biggest jobs marketplace in the world, right?

Hari Srinivasan (00:19:08):
We have a lot of professional jobs on our platform and a lot of professional seekers.

Lenny (00:19:11):
Hopefully, mysterious. I imagine it is. I don't know. I guess Indeed might be a competitor, but okay, let's say it's one of the bigger job markets. You influenced the way jobs are sought and posted and how people find jobs; so in a sense, designing. Sounds like basically, there was an internal decision. Let's focus on the skills approach. What's cool about that is that changes the way hiring happens in the world.

Hari Srinivasan (00:19:33):
It's one of the things that I think is so interesting about building products today is, it has to clearly be something people want. If we had just said we're going to go like this, and every hire was like, "I don't want to do this," or every job seeker said, "I don't care about it," I don't think anything would click. We also have to be receptive enough to amplify that signal and allow it to work through a system so that it could actually be easy to use.

(00:19:56):
I don't think we said that, "Hey, we got to go and do this value-based thing." I think we started feeling it and hearing it from members and then as we adapted, these things start amplifying as they come through. I do think that's hopefully something that I think about a lot is, let's just make sure that we keep a pulse on what people want and we make sure that we can get that through a system at a pretty fast pace. Because then, we will hopefully continue to be a place where people want to go look for jobs and make hires.

Lenny (00:20:25):
What I was thinking about as you were just chatting is this open to work feature that LinkedIn has. I remember days before that existed and people used to just like jury-rig, "Hey, I'm hiring," or, "I'm looking for a job." There's always this sense that if you're open to work, you're not as good. Because why would you be amazing and open to work and not hired? I'm curious if you were even part of this experience. Just, what was it like to come up with that approach to how to communicate that you're open to work?

Hari Srinivasan (00:20:51):
It's been through phases and I think those phases really reflect on the perception of how it's changed. In the beginning it was, you could say you're open to work, but it was a secret signal to recruiters if you will. That certainly still exists, but now we said you could more publicly say it and maybe it'd be a feed post. And then we started launching it. Actually it was around COVID when a lot of the stigmas of unemployment changed dramatically, because everyone started understanding you're in this different situation. We started putting it the frame and that's the more iconic way I think people associate with now.

(00:21:22):
It's funny. Just this week, we tried something new and I feel like it's almost the same journey. There are many customers as you can imagine, that have LinkedIn Learning and LinkedIn Learning is typically an enterprise product. It works across your employee base. We're trying to do Open to Internal Work where you can say, "I'm actually at the point where I may want the next play internally in my role," and an internal recruiter can see you. As you can imagine, I would actually even maybe argue more stigma about being concerned about upsetting your manager. Certainly, there's different cultures and companies about this.

(00:21:52):
I have a feeling in sometimes we like to think five, 10 years out, I think it's going to go on the same journey. That's one hunch I have, that there'll also be an employment-driven way internally for people to find their next play. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, but already you can feel a little bit of that tension right when we launched it and knowing. Let's see how this goes.

Lenny (00:22:13):
You were talking about how hiring is changing. I'm curious how PM hiring specifically is changing. A lot of people listening to this podcast are product managers. Is there anything unique you're noticing there?

Hari Srinivasan (00:22:22):
Maybe a couple stats that could be very helpful. If you're having a hard time finding a PM role, let's start with this, you're probably not alone. We publish it. You can go to Economic Graph data. This is all public. We publish this. But if you look at tech, it's down about 50% year-over-year. We look at hires over total population on LinkedIn. You can go to Economic Graphs and you can see how it compares trends industry. We don't look at the functional data as much, but the PM data seems to be trending just slightly even maybe below software engineers and data as well, which is maybe a comp for this. I know not everything is perfect industry to function cuts.

(00:22:56):
It is a difficult place, but I'll give you a couple tips because I imagine that may be helpful for a couple of the listeners. It's certainly one of the larger inbounds of things I get. The first is, in those markets, you do want to make sure that the more you can do to form relationships and say that this is what you can do, which is always helpful. Now, I know that not everyone has relationships, but you can always try to develop those at different places and across LinkedIn as well. But that's one thing I would really, really start to look for.

(00:23:24):
The second thing I would really do is we have launched the way now to come in and signal obviously that you are interested in a role. We have those open to work capabilities, but then each job has a set of skills that they're looking for under it, like we talked about in skills-first hiring. Against each skill, you can actually add different kinds of credentials. I would really encourage people to add work products if that's something that they're actually building. You can add different kinds of recommendations or other things they can associate with that skill. Those credentials against it I think are becoming much more interesting for people to say, "Oh, this is someone I'm actually looking for."

(00:23:55):
And then the third thing I would really encourage PMs to start looking through is, this is probably more personal than anything in data, but every PM job is different. If you have experience in that industry and you're able to show that you have experience in that industry or some kind of understanding of it, I think that's a way to separate. I'd really start zoning in on roles where you might see if you don't have the functional experience, the industry experience. I think that would go a long way as how to help you differentiate from yes, what's probably more candidates, or more applications going into each role.

Lenny (00:24:30):
When you say industry experience, what's an example of that?

Hari Srinivasan (00:24:32):
Imagine that you are applying for a PM role, but that particular software is in, I don't know, automotive tech. If you happen to have worked in automotive before, have a knowledge about cars, that's a very helpful way to get in. I think if you're able to show that you can show an industry knowledge and an understanding of it, I think it's a real nice way to think about how to position yourself against some of the other candidates.

Lenny (00:24:55):
What else can that person looking for a job do to improve their chances of a recruiter basically finding them? I feel like that's probably the best tactical thing they can do because a lot of LinkedIn is recruiters reaching out and finding you.

Hari Srinivasan (00:25:08):
There's two things that anyone who's hiring is always going to look for. They're going to look for your skills and capabilities and they're going to look for your intent and interest in the role. A lot of our products and the pathways we try to do are making those things simpler. Maybe we'll just start with interest and we'll move back to skills in a minute. A couple of things we've launched recently, and I think they are symbolic of other ways you can connect. If you go to a company page and you're looking at the company, and I think they have to opt into this in some degree, look, you can say you're interested in that company even though they don't have roles. When the next role comes up, they'll have a signal that this person is actually very interested in this role.

(00:25:42):
That's an easy way to signify from an early stage that you have interest in them. That way, when they open up a role, as you can imagine, they start looking through, they'll have a spotlight on recruiter and they can click out on it and come through. Certainly, you can go into open work and say that this is something that I'm open to work right now, and you can signify to the whole population that this is an area that you want to go for as well. I would encourage both of those in some ways. If you're looking for a role, be open about it and tell the companies that you're looking for it. Those are really high signals of intent.

(00:26:09):
The other thing you can do on LinkedIn is you can actually go through when you say open to work and you can specify particular kinds of jobs and things you're looking for. I think that more detailed intent helps make sure you're showing it to the right place.

(00:26:21):
On the skill side, we talked about it a little bit, but I do think there's a big change. When you were just looking at title, I think you only had one way to really prove that you had the skills. You had to have that title, which is very hard to break in. In a world where you're looking at skills, you can go through and say, "Look, I can do these things and you could put evidence behind it." I'd really encourage people to do that. If you just go to any job post, you can see the skills, you can say add and you can see all the evidence and how you can add it. I would really encourage people to do that because when people are in recruiter and they're looking for skills, profiles pop up and you can scroll over a skill and you can actually see all those evidences.

(00:26:56):
Basically, a recruiter could say, "Oh, this is why I'd recommend you to this hiring manager." I think you will find that that's hopefully a very useful way of doing it.

Lenny (00:27:05):
I'm going to lob this question like a fishing line, to see if it catches anything. And if not, we'll move on. Are there any stats that you've seen of just like if you do X, Y, Z, your chances of getting hired or getting people reaching out just go significantly higher?

Hari Srinivasan (00:27:20):
Open to work certainly has a high signal to noise. As you can imagine, when someone's looking to fill a role, that's one they want. We are early in company commitments, but we are seeing some signal there that we got to move through it. Skills has a pretty high signal as well, when you're able to come through and show and demonstrate your skills. We're seeing some correlation to basically people getting a role.

(00:27:41):
And then the final one that is harder for us to look through, but it's certainly important. I do think we show the hiring manager on a lot of the roles. We show these people through. It's harder for us to trace that because of the way the outcomes work, but I would really encourage people to look through that and see if you can get in front of those people.

Lenny (00:27:58):
Is there a max seniority that you find works effectively on LinkedIn to find a job? I imagine CPOs aren't finding jobs on LinkedIn. If I'm looking for a job, do you have a rule of thumb of, if you're at this level, maybe you're not going to have a lot of luck? If you're below the-

Hari Srinivasan (00:28:15):
We certainly have CPO jobs that are posted, but the difference often is job posts versus recruiting. More and more senior roles are often recruited. We find that people will use LinkedIn in order to connect to a CPO and many people who are senior will say, "Oh, I got a message on LinkedIn and that led to this," or they made a long-term recruiting contact. But it may not happen through you finding a job and hitting the application button.

Lenny (00:28:38):
Let's talk about LinkedIn as a company to work in, the culture maybe for a bit. You told me that you have a story about your first product review when you joined LinkedIn and how that was wild. Can you just tell that story? I haven't heard this yet.

Hari Srinivasan (00:28:51):
Yeah. I came through a small acquisition that they made of our company, and I thought it was such a telling moment in this first product review. I went in and as you can imagine when you join a company, there's a lot of advice on how you should make that product work. I didn't know anything. I'd never been a PM. I remember taking a lot of that advice and putting together a presentation and just getting destroyed during that review. I think Jeff was the head of product and CEO at that point. In a very kind way, it was basically like, "Wait, this doesn't make any sense."

(00:29:23):
I just remember driving home and calling my wife and like, "I think I might be fired." I'm not sure if I was fired, but he was very kind about it. He's like, "Just come back and exit." I think five, four weeks. I remembered at that point I was like, if you're going to go in and you know you only have one shot, just do something you believe in and make sure it works. We started from that point and we worked backwards from there in this concept of, "Hey, I do believe that the most important thing is connecting to opportunity and we should really understand how to do that. Let's just start from there." It went very well.

(00:29:50):
To me, it was another way of you're in these large systems, you're in these large companies, you're in these large ... I think LinkedIn is very special because no matter what it is, it's got a very good North Star. It was a moment for me to really hammer that home, that as long as you get that North Star ahead of you, you're going to be just fine. I never worked at a place like that before, and I think a lot of times people wonder. You can imagine. The way we're talking about, we certainly have an engagement ecosystem. We have the hiring business and we have a marketing solutions business. We have a big premium business.

(00:30:24):
You can imagine when you're trying to make decisions across that, it could get very, very complicated. I think when people ask me to describe LinkedIn, I often start with that story because I feel like it helps cut through how decisions are made and what is seen as success here.

Lenny (00:30:39):
Just to clarify, so that North star is that phrase that you used of just connecting people to economic opportunity?

Hari Srinivasan (00:30:45):
That's it. That's it. I know it sounds bigger than it seems, but I can probably ... Time example again. You can understand when someone's driving on it. Having been here for a little bit now, you can understand when someone knows that and when someone doesn't. It's a hard thing to lose track of.

Lenny (00:31:00):
Yeah. It does sound vague and a nice, fuzzy, warm thing that people can say. What you're saying is that it's actually brought up in meetings constantly and product reviews. You're saying in this product review, everything changed when you came at it from that one perspective?

Hari Srinivasan (00:31:16):
Yeah. My first product here was the profile. You can make a profile that does a lot of different things, as you can imagine. You could think about how identity could be used in many different phases and what you should prioritize and not. But if you can explain why this is the thing that you should do that would help someone really do what they want to do, maybe it's have an incredible podcast and send that out there, maybe it's helping someone connect to a job. But if you can understand intent and how this is unblocked and why you want to prioritize that item, all of a sudden the world gets a lot simpler.

Lenny (00:31:51):
How does that actually get operationalized at a company? Is it just the leaders remind people of that? It's painted on the walls? How is that a thing that people come back to over and over?

Hari Srinivasan (00:32:01):
I do think it's a lot of repeat, repeat, repeat. I do think that's it. I do think the culture has a pretty high immune system now in the sense that when you aren't operating by that, people can see it and they operate against it. I think when Jeff was CEO, and Ryan, they are just exceptional at continuously repeating that. It's been so consistent for so long that I think it's just the DNA now. I do think it's exceptional. I think it's exceptional leadership, and I've learned so much from watching it and how it gets operated.

Lenny (00:32:34):
Is there a metric associated with that when people use it in a way of like, no, that's not actually what we mean? Is there some way of making it even more concrete in goals, metrics, ways to understand if people are actually achieving that?

Hari Srinivasan (00:32:46):
Yeah. Totally. I think at the next level of operation, what we think about is, when we run these marketplaces throughout this ecosystem that connect people to opportunity, what are the outputs that they measure? I'll just give you mine for example. We think a lot about number of hires, converting hires. How many people did we match? Which is a real tangible way of looking at opportunity.

(00:33:04):
And then number of people who learned a skill, which is usually in this world measured more by time than anything if you learn. Spend time for X amount of minutes. We do that skill because oftentimes skills don't have a direct outcome as you can measure to go through. We basically look at those things more than any other to say how successful that we are operating that marketplace.

Lenny (00:33:22):
Got it. Those make total sense to me.

Hari Srinivasan (00:33:24):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:33:24):
Are there other core values of LinkedIn that are public that you can share?

Hari Srinivasan (00:33:28):
You can Google them too and so they're very, very public, but probably the one that I think is most important to talk about in this world is, there's this concept of members first. I think anytime you run an ecosystem as complex as we do and you think about it, even if you're trying to connect people to opportunity, there's two people, how are you going to decide right now who needs it?

(00:33:49):
I think having clarity on which piece of the ecosystem is going to be where the focus is, it helps us make sure we establish a relationship of trust first, make sure to understand who's getting access to data, make sure we understand how decisions are being made. I always love that as a principle that we've stuck by.

Lenny (00:34:05):
Yeah, I see it on the page here. We put members first.

Hari Srinivasan (00:34:10):
Story checks out is what you're telling me.

Lenny (00:34:11):
Checks out. Checks out. What's interesting is the connecting people to opportunity, economic opportunity is not one of these values. It seems like it's even broader. They should at the company basically.

Hari Srinivasan (00:34:21):
The company, yeah.

Lenny (00:34:23):
Got it. Okay. I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:34:52):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:35:32):
You've touched on this idea of a complex system and I want to spend a little bit more time there. LinkedIn is, as you said, very, very complicated. There's all these marketplaces within marketplaces. There's so many customers you got to make happy. They all have to work together. I'm just curious what you've learned about building and maintaining a complex ecosystem like that.

Hari Srinivasan (00:35:55):
It's a fantastic question. I just openly think first of all, just career-wise, I've always been drawn to that. We talk about product as a whole. We always talk about it as a whole, but there's many different things you can build, many different types of things. And then we go, maybe there's hardware and software consumer goods. I actually try to think about products by their complexity curve a lot.

(00:36:17):
I think that the skills you need to manage a complicated ecosystem versus maybe the skills you need to design something that's less interconnected are quite different. I will get to the details maybe of what I mean in a minute, but I do think LinkedIn's a particularly complicated place. And I do think that the skillsets that you think through and you try to manage in a complicated ecosystem are quite different. Maybe some tactics that can help if it's something along those lines.

Lenny (00:36:42):
Yeah, let's do it.

Hari Srinivasan (00:36:43):
One of the things that I often think about is this concept of cause and effect. If you have non-interconnected things, it's actually quite easy not to have to think about that. You made something people love. I wrote a children's book not too long ago and it was fun. It was awesome to write. Once it was done, it was done, and it was out there and it was able to go. That's a little bit different than here. If you make a change, like open to work, all of a sudden you're thinking through the perception of someone on the other side. What is that going to do? Are they going to use the platform less or more? You're thinking about customers. What are they going to do with that data? Are they going to, to your point, perceive someone in a different way or not?

(00:37:21):
You have to think through second and third and maybe even fourth effects and manage that as you go through. I think that is something we really pride ourselves on is, how do we start thinking through these different things, and how do we start measuring them as we go? That is one.

(00:37:35):
The second thing I actually think is it does lead to your point a lot. You need a different kind of decision-making mechanism because there's a lot more ties in the ecosystem, a lot of people who just need a way to break it. We've put in things like we have something called RAPID, which is a really easy way to know who the decision-maker is. Just, you line up who's a recommender, who has to agree, who's a decision-maker. We have something called a five-day escalation rule, which makes sure that those items are in. I think you lead a lot more of those fuse, I don't know what they're called, fuse limits, or just systems in place in order to manage that complexity so that things get done. I think that those processes are actually really, really important to make sure that the ecosystem can run.

Lenny (00:38:10):
Let's talk about these two processes. RAPID, and what was the other one? Five-day-

Hari Srinivasan (00:38:14):
Yeah, five-day alignment. They've both been around LinkedIn for a little bit, but they're great. The RAPID is just a question of oftentimes to your point, if you're running two, three marketplaces, several different business model here, there's a question of who has the decision? Who can make the decision in this situation? Making sure that you have a single person's name with the decision and that person is ... That is really, really important because it gets the clarity real fast.

(00:38:36):
It's more of a personal rule, but one thing I love to say is, if you had three back and forths in an email, you got to pick up the phone. And if you've been on the phone for 20 minutes, it's time to just write that decision-maker and go. That way, you can make sure the concept of an hour, you should be able to get a decision. It doesn't always operate like that. I'm sure there's many PMs on LinkedIn who are operating here maybe, who may have some feedback from me on that, but that's the intent behind it.

(00:38:58):
And then a five-day alignment is, you should hold your managers accountable. That in five days if someone has something that they haven't been able to escalate and solve, that's probably then on the next level of person. But as you run that ecosystem and there's so much complexity around it, I think you need some of those processes in place in order to start answering some of those tiebreakers, if you will.

Lenny (00:39:17):
Ooh, I like that five-day rule. Basically puts the clock on a manager to get to unblock, basically?

Hari Srinivasan (00:39:23):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny (00:39:25):
With RAPID, I don't know if I totally understand. Is that an acronym for something? Or is it just-

Hari Srinivasan (00:39:29):
It is.

Lenny (00:39:29):
... make decisions rapidly?

Hari Srinivasan (00:39:31):
No, that's a great question. The D stands for decisions, but the R is for who's recommending it. The A, who has to agree. The I is for other people who may be able to be putting in an input. It's basically a list of people who need to be in the decision chain.

Lenny (00:39:44):
Got it.

Hari Srinivasan (00:39:45):
I would argue the most important thing is to have a single name on that decision line, because that usually makes sure that you can get a decision very quickly.

Lenny (00:39:51):
Are there any other really common frameworks or processes along these lines at LinkedIn that you find really helpful?

Hari Srinivasan (00:39:56):
The third thing is just in how we think about talent, especially in the product organization. I often really do try to suss out during interviews or in how we promote people, just their ability to see systems. Because again, I do think it's a different skillset and a different capability of how we map those things out on a complexity curve. Oftentimes, I think those talent systems will ... those who are able to see the whole, make decisions at the whole, that's rare actually.

(00:40:24):
I think most talent systems are, "Hey, how did your division grow or your product grow, your era grow?" We've tried our best to understand that it's not just about that. You want accountability in the ecosystem of course, but how well does this person work across? I think as we've created telemetry around that or organizational understanding of that, how we've understood ourselves, just, "Hey, this is the skillset that's really important here," I think that's quite rare in driving that kind of complexity system as well.

Lenny (00:40:52):
One more question along these lines.

Hari Srinivasan (00:40:53):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:54):
You've been at LinkedIn for a long time. It feels like historically, LinkedIn as a product team, the external impression was it's very optimizey-oriented and everyone there is just micro-optimizing all the little features of LinkedIn. Everyone I've worked with from LinkedIn, they're just really good at just optimizing things.

(00:41:16):
It feels like a lot of new stuff is happening with LinkedIn these days and I'm curious if that's been a real intentional shift of let's not focus so much on making emails work better and all the click-through rates of everything and more just, let's innovate more, let's do some bigger bets.

Hari Srinivasan (00:41:34):
I do think there's two things to acknowledge. First, there's an incredible growth team, and I think a lot of people that go on from LinkedIn in incredible roles are growth. I think there's an influencer change that a lot of people you meet might be growth-oriented. The second thing is, especially when LinkedIn started, and like you said, I've been here a little bit of time, but growing the network is probably a very, very important thing to get the scale out. I think a lot of things people interacted with at first were maybe more growth mechanisms than other systems.

(00:42:02):
I do think there's always been, at least for the last several years, an underlining line that value is what's going to carry this ecosystem, and value is ultimately what makes the day. To your point, I like to think that they may not be the most, I don't know, the glittery items, but I'm really proud of what we've done with skills. I think that's one of those invisible systems that no one really knows. Like, oh my gosh, that's a huge disruption if people can now get ... That's a huge language that people have created. That's a huge way that people have changed.

(00:42:32):
We're really proud of what we've done with values. Even open to work and commitments, these are major social systems that we've wired through. I'm really proud of what we've done with LinkedIn Learning. I would argue it's one of the bigger creator systems in the world. It's these incredible instructors and the ability to take someone who teaches, maybe is not great on camera, and move them to the studio and give them that capability and take their voice out there.

(00:42:55):
I think there's a lot of different things we've done that maybe because they're more invisible, if you will, or they're hidden in a marketplace that necessarily maybe a lot of the influencer voices may not actually need an access every day, I don't know if they get as much visibility. But I like to think that's been part of the DNA for a while and we've been really thinking through it.

Lenny (00:43:17):
Let's actually talk about LinkedIn Learning. I know this is a big passion of yours. You have your own course within this that I want to talk about. But broadly, just what is LinkedIn Learning, just so people understand? Because I don't know if a lot of people know this exists within LinkedIn.

Hari Srinivasan (00:43:29):
Great question. LinkedIn Learning is basically a way to learn professional skills. We entered the business in 2015 and the thesis was, we think about it as a marketplace again. You have seekers and job and oftentimes, seekers may not have all the skills in order to get the job. We're moving now towards the skills model, but without question, this other second-order impact. I don't think any of us wanted to, if you will, uberize the world. I don't think any of us wanted to make everyone there. We wanted to make sure everyone had the skills in order to learn the skills, in order to get there. Getting the learning business was really, really important for the vision and the mission. Basically, the idea was that we'd have ways to teach people skills that was very much tailored to professionals.

(00:44:12):
Now, that was the vision. The way the mechanism works is, we go and get the best instructors in the world. We will bring them into a film studio. We will do it at home or in a way that makes the content extremely ... We help write the scripts, we obviously have incredible graphic, in a way that makes a teacher and someone who's an expert who may not always have the capability or the time to go and make their own online course and get them in the studio and go from there. And then the vast majority of people will probably have access to it through their company. The vast majority of the usage and the business runs through enterprise and is a large enterprise learning product.

Lenny (00:44:47):
Awesome. Yeah. I'm just as a, I don't know, armchair quarterback strategy person, I could see where this came from of we're trying to help people connect to economic opportunity, find jobs. How do we help them? Oh, they don't have the skill? Let's help them build the skills. Makes a lot of sense. Okay. Within this, you have your own course on product management.

Hari Srinivasan (00:45:05):
Well, it's funny. I'd been thinking about a course for a while, but largely it was this concept of, I wanted to make sure I tried our own product and I understood the instructor pain point. But it's a very scary experience. It's like first, I don't know if I had anything to teach. My own concerns about that. But about four or five years ago, one of the things we started at PM internally was product university. We had our own internal university, which was basically we got some survey, we sent it out. I think everyone told us, well, it's literally the most negative one was people said, "I don't have the skills to do my job."

(00:45:40):
I remember looking around and I'm like, "Well, it's pretty obvious. We hired a bunch of people, there's no PM degree, and we've done nothing." What we started doing is internally creating a product university. It was a bootcamp coming in. We tried to get from different models and one of the things we really learned was, you can't teach this just through frameworks. You needed to have a series of case studies. You need to have a real series examples. But luckily, we had a bunch of things we'd done at LinkedIn, so we started putting a curriculum against that. And then just recently, a few of us got together and we filmed the actual course for it. It's basically taking our product university bootcamp and opening it up to the world.

Lenny (00:46:14):
You opened up some of your internal use cases as a part of this course?

Hari Srinivasan (00:46:17):
We do. Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:18):
That's awesome. I always say that one of the things you don't realize you have as an advantage working at a bigger company is access to tons of strategy documents and vision documents and stories of this. Because once you're out, no one's going to be able to share those with you because they're so private. I don't have access to any of these anymore. That's a really cool perk if you're working at a company like LinkedIn.

Hari Srinivasan (00:46:39):
Thanks. Yeah.

Lenny (00:46:40):
Question about your course. What are some of your biggest lessons that you teach? Can you just give a preview of some of the tidbits that you might learn in this course of yours?

Hari Srinivasan (00:46:48):
Well, again, a lot of it is case studies and use cases in the same way we teach it here, but a couple of things that we do talk through. When we started doing our own product university, we realized a couple big pain points that people hit. The first was, it's actually really hard to know how to validate and what the bar is for a new idea in any organization. I think it's really hard to say that. We provide a lot of framework. Simple things from, "Hey, you got to prove to the world why there's duct tape in here." There's someone actually physically going out and trying to do it.

(00:47:19):
How you can prioritize a list of ideas against a pain point, like how to make a simple expression, and how to look through what's an acute pain point and what's a wide range of people use, how we'd expect data in order to be used in order to validate this. Tools you could use to say if this is a good idea or a bad idea. More importantly tools to make sure you've went through the process and how you can communicate it. That's one framework set that we talked through.

(00:47:42):
The other is a lot about Damian, who leads our growth team. He comes in and he starts talking a lot about thinking in loops. How do you make sure that when you're building something you can have the fuel in order to cascade and grow? I think just the framework of doing that, how you measure that, how you monitor that, is also something that at least when I was starting and doing my startup, it was quite something I wish I had had access to. Those are maybe two good examples of frameworks and tools that we come through.

(00:48:09):
And then of course, trying to overlay that with real cases. Not always successful ones, of course, too. We talk about a lot of the failures we've had and where we probably went wrong if we had to diagnose them in postmortem.

Lenny (00:48:19):
A lot of the people listening to this are people that want to get into product management and aren't PMs yet. I imagine you get asked this a lot, how do I get into product management? What is your advice that you often give?

Hari Srinivasan (00:48:29):
Yeah. Well, let's start with how we look at the world, which is this idea of skills. We have a diagram that I think about, which is skills are on a triangle. You might have heard this one before. I don't know if you have. Skills are on a triangle, and I think you need three different skills to be a great PM. You need to be a Steven Spielberg type creator. Something around data science and the ability to really look at data and see patterns and then see the future. And then especially get more senior. I think it's a lot of general management. You have to basically be able to shine and innovate across the team, understand the budget, understand how companies differently work.

(00:49:01):
I've actually never seen a great PM who's in the center of it. I find the great PMs live on the edges. There's always someone who's this exceptional data scientist and the ability to maybe be a great GM and lead and inspire, or maybe someone who's so creative, who can lead a team in a different way. I think that one thing I would really, really encourage people to do is understand where they fit on that graph and gravitate towards those kinds of roles. Because a lot of times, I think what people do is they think they have to make up for the other pieces of that graph, and it leads them to a path where maybe they're not playing to their strengths. That's one thing I always encourage people.

(00:49:38):
The other thing I would say, and I know it's a little bit of luck in how this works, but I think about my journey, one thing I've really found was really helpful is, I was on the first team that did a hybrid SUV in the US. At the time, it was the Hybrid Escape at Ford. I came from the Midwest and it was one of those products where people would really drive out for hundreds of miles and see, and really a community gravitated around because it was a very special product. Being able to work on something that people loved, really loved early on, and see what that felt like and look like and that success was, it created a bar for what I would hope my products could do. It would.

(00:50:17):
If you're able to get into something that people really love and feel that and experience that, and really understand what that looks like and what it takes to get there, I think that's actually been a really valuable lesson throughout my career because you can understand the whole path on the way up. I look back at that as really something that I would hope other people if they can do it. I know you're making world decisions on many different criteria, but try to find something people love and really experience what that feels like.

Lenny (00:50:40):
To build on that, with PMs that work for you and work with you, when they're looking to get better and build their skills, other than go take some courses on LinkedIn Learning, what do you often recommend they do to help become stronger and better at their job?

Hari Srinivasan (00:50:56):
First, it is that feeling of, you got to own your product and you got to speak up and say this is where I want to drive it. Because a lot of times I think people are scared to do that, or worried about doing that, or don't feel that's their actual role. One, it's extreme clarity on hey this is your role. It's to own this and take this to the next level. When you start molding the clay, people want to come and help. When you start building something cool, people are like, "Oh." They're gravitated to it. But until you can start doing that, that's really tough. One, it's letting people know that's what's expected of them.

(00:51:26):
And then two, I would tell people to just build. As crazy as it sounds, I spend a lot of my time on the side, just trying to build different things. Try different clay, think through different ideas. I think that is a really important skill to have, to just being able to say, "Okay, I'm going to start with a blank sheet and make some art," or whatever it is you want to do. I encourage people to do that because it's a muscle, like anything else. It can atrophy. I really do think no matter what the heart of PM, in is that ability to be a builder, and you do got to make sure you can keep doing it.

Lenny (00:51:57):
Yeah. That's actually a great segue to where I was going to go next, which is, you say you build and you like to build stuff, but you're legitimately building a lot of stuff. You have the site, mindofhari.com, where you share all these side projects. Can you just talk about what's going on there and some of the stuff that you've built?

Hari Srinivasan (00:52:12):
Yeah. Arguably, the only thing I've ever been good at in my life is just building things and creating things. I get a lot of energy from it. Yeah, I have a site. It's called Mind of Hari because it is really whatever's top of mind. I try to do my best to completely separate it from business. I know there's always a draw as a good PM to say, is there a business here? But I try to keep it as art. It's completely art and it's what I want to build. I take on new subjects. I have two little kids and it's fun to ... One of them was a book me and my oldest wrote, and it was a set of bedtime stories we did. And then one day I was like, "Hey, we should just make this a notebook." And we did it. I think it's got about half-a-million readers now. It's been fun to see it take some life and go through.

(00:52:57):
We made a board game recently that I know Stanford Design School or some professors there have been using, and it was called Parallel Universe. It's, how do you have a card and then be able to see maybe the card says there's no windows in this world anymore, and then what would happen in that world? You got to list 10 different things that would happen. That ability to think ahead, the fun sci-fi stuff. I make healthy gummy bears. I just try to take something completely new and have that. I don't know, it's probably one of the more fun moments in this world where you can sit there and just create something and have some new clay. Yeah, that is what that website is about.

Lenny (00:53:34):
Wait, so you made actual gummy bears?

Hari Srinivasan (00:53:36):
Yeah, we are doing something with gummy bears. Lenny, I know you're expecting a new addition. Congratulations, again. But one of the things I found when I had kids is, no matter what I was trying to do, there was candy and sugar everywhere like any Halloween, any birthday party, et cetera. You can't get rid of it because it was just hard to do. So we were like, hey, we're going to sit down and make our own gummy bear. What I found is, this is just a fun tidbit for your readers, if you open a Twizzler or one of those, about 80% of what's in there is sugar because they're optimizing for shelf life. They're optimizing for what's in the store.

(00:54:07):
What we were able to do is basically create a gummy bear. About 40% of it is sugar. It's just got five ingredients. Honey is the sweetener because I don't want to give my kids some alternative sweeteners. But we have a small commercial kitchen and we produce some gummy bears. If you ever want to try them, to any of your followers, I'm happy to send some gummy bears and hopefully you can check them out.

Lenny (00:54:27):
Wait, is there a way to buy them somewhere?

Hari Srinivasan (00:54:29):
Well, you can go to Mind of Hari. We stock them seasonally. One of the things that we found out is there is different laws on how they can be shipped, and obviously we're not optimizing for long storage. But they'll be on Mind of Hari. You can always reach out to me and I'll find you and tell you which farmer's market we're at or whatever and you can come swing by.

Lenny (00:54:48):
Well, I don't see it on Mind of Hari, so maybe by the time this comes out, put it on here. Or if you're trying to-

Hari Srinivasan (00:54:53):
Put it on there?

Lenny (00:54:54):
Yeah.

Hari Srinivasan (00:54:54):
Yeah, it's on the homepage. And then when they're stock, we put them in the shop.

Lenny (00:54:57):
Okay. That means they're out of stock? All right, we're going to sell you out. Let's get all your gummy bears. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Hari Srinivasan (00:55:06):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (00:55:07):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Hari Srinivasan (00:55:11):
The first one is called Thinking in Systems. It's the one I give the team every now and then. It's just a really good book about how I think sometimes people see systems. Can we talk about it? It could be abstract. I think it goes into real detail on how people can intervene at various parts and how to take actions at different systems. I really enjoy that book.

(00:55:31):
Not directly maybe a book I recommend, but a book that I just read that I thought was phenomenal, just to give it to readers if they want something good, it's called Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. It was recommending by a friend. Have you read it? You read it?

Lenny (00:55:41):
Yeah. I honestly didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.

Hari Srinivasan (00:55:45):
For some reason, I've been-

Lenny (00:55:47):
It was sweet.

Hari Srinivasan (00:55:47):
I thought it was very well done and there's a couple chapters I reflected on. I just finished it. I thought it was well done. That's one that I'll throw out there.

Lenny (00:55:54):
Yeah, it was very sweet. I feel like it got hyped too much for me. I'm like, okay.

Hari Srinivasan (00:55:54):
Oh, I didn't actually know it got-

Lenny (00:55:54):
I think that's the key.

Hari Srinivasan (00:56:01):
... much publicity. Okay, that's it. The third one that I just downloaded because I finished it, I'm actually going to open up my audiobook and tell you because I'm about, I don't know, an hour into and I'm really enjoying it, it is An Immense World. I don't know if you've read that one yet. It is about animals and how animals have different senses out there. It goes through a set of different animals and how they see the world.

(00:56:24):
Just one of those reminders that we're so limited sometimes in our own perception and how dogs, for instance, they can breathe in and take in sense even when they're breathing out. It's like vision almost, and it's just phenomenal to me just to think about all the things they're probably sensing as my dog and I are going on our walk.

Lenny (00:56:42):
I've learned dogs shoot air out of their nose first before they smell, to clear things out.

Hari Srinivasan (00:56:48):
Isn't that wild? They can probably see so much more of what happened in the history of a little walk than we're able to just because of that.

Lenny (00:56:57):
Incredible. Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Hari Srinivasan (00:57:03):
One thing we try to do is watch TV as a family. It brings us together a little bit. We are doing Star Wars with the kids, which is for the first time, which has been a really enjoyable experience, just being able to witness it through them. And then we've been going a little bit back in time. We watched ET. It's fun. It jogs your memory. These are phenomenal movies that we go through. I think your question is on recent TV shows that probably came out more recently.

Lenny (00:57:27):
Those work just as well.

Hari Srinivasan (00:57:28):
Yeah. The other one I did like, it's not a TV show but I ... God, what was it called? It was that podcast that came out. Case 63 I think it was called? Anyways, I hope that's the right name of it. But it was a sci-fi podcast. It was like 10-minute shorts. The premise of it is someone comes from the future and there's a little bit of speculative fiction and is at a psychologist. It's just a phenomenal piece. I'll have to get you the real name. Maybe I can get it for you after for the show notes or whatever.

Lenny (00:57:56):
Yeah, we'll edit your words and add that-

Hari Srinivasan (00:57:59):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:57:59):
... whatever's in the show notes, that's the one you meant. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask?

Hari Srinivasan (00:58:06):
I do like to ask people what the most complex thing they ever built was. I just love to understand mostly, what do they gravitate to? Is there something you gravitate to? And two, are they able to simplify it? I think those are two really important skills.

Lenny (00:58:19):
What is it that you look for in their answer that tells you it was a good answer?

Hari Srinivasan (00:58:23):
Both of those things. First, did they take on something that was super complex, really, really hard? Because I think there's only a particular group of people who gravitate to those kinds of problems. I do think more and more openly. I think that's a lot of, in my opinion, the ways the world is going to get better by the things that are really, really hard to solve. Intimacy doesn't scale. When you think about how people are going to feel more connected, it's going to be a lot more difficult to solve. When you think about healthcare, it's going to be very, very difficult to solve. Education is a very difficult interconnected space. I think people who gravitate to that, know those problems are hard, have a very special gift. It's hard to replicate that passion. So one, did you do that?

(00:59:06):
And then two, I think people who really understand systems are able to, somehow this is truly, especially people probably way smarter than me, they're able to simplify it. They're able to explain it and say, "This is how I looked at it, but here's how I modeled it. Here's the lovers and how I went after it." Even if it's nonlinear, they're able to say, "This is how the cause and effects works." I'm really looking for once you did it, did you really understand and were you able to crack it? Or at least, did you understand why you weren't able to crack it? I usually find this to be also the most rewarding conversations.

Lenny (00:59:35):
Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that.

Hari Srinivasan (00:59:36):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:59:37):
Next question. What is a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?

Hari Srinivasan (00:59:42):
I'll give you one more dad one. My youngest just hates brushing his teeth. Just was like, it was always a thing. I should actually find the name of the toothbrush, but you can just Google or Amazon this and you'll figure it out. Basically, it's like it was this Baby Shark toothbrush, but it's a game. You play that game for two minutes and you can try to pick up different prizes, you brush your teeth.

(01:00:02):
What I loved about it, because I think it's what all great products do, it turns a moment of annoyance to a moment of joy. It went not even just like you solved a pain point. It was an unreasonable experience of like now he loves it. It was just so well done. It's like 10 bucks, and it was 10 bucks extremely well spent. So much delight. Whoever made that toothbrush, thank you.

Lenny (01:00:23):
Damn. Is it playing Baby Shark? I hope not.

Hari Srinivasan (01:00:26):
Well, it can. It has that feature. It has that capability, but it is a small price to pay for me to get out to enjoy.

Lenny (01:00:35):
Good times. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Hari Srinivasan (01:00:44):
I do like to change things relatively. Every quarter or six months, sit down and say, what can we get better at? The two areas I find myself innovating, if you will, innovating or tweaking the most, one is around planning. I think every company struggles with this. You get bigger, it probably becomes a more different ... especially when we talked about the complexity of the ecosystem. We started this thing where just basically we call it orange and red priorities. Which is, then a lot of times what people do is, teams will plan bottom-up.

(01:01:12):
They'll come into a manager or a leader and then the leader may shift things around or say, this is what ... I think we've really started shifting it in a different way. We said, these are the big rocks we got to get done. We're going to get those things done first. We're going to be upfront and honest with you, and these are the things and these are price. And then you can plan from there. I think it's relieved a lot of the progress. I think there's an honesty that comes within and that's been a big change.

(01:01:34):
The others just are the way we review products. That's always been a thing. My read is, when we keep our product review process live too long, it gets a little institutionalized and people start making long documents and stuff. You always have to change that every quarter. Basically, I think it always comes down to the same thing, which is, how do you get their problem statement quickly? And then how do you design from there? But the lever that we basically put in place for that was to really shorten the time.

(01:02:00):
I'm trying this thing, I don't know if it's going to work. But could we get to 15-minute reviews basically instead of an hour and see if that alleviates some of this? I'll let you know how it goes when we chat up next, but I'm very curious to see if this is going to be a different kind of system where we might be able to get to clarity quicker, or realize we're not at clarity and then break and come back.

Lenny (01:02:21):
Reminds me of a tweet I think I just saw. Maybe it was an Instagram post of teams that do stand-ups while doing a plank, to keep the meeting really short.

Hari Srinivasan (01:02:29):
That's interesting.

Lenny (01:02:30):
Could be the next one.

Hari Srinivasan (01:02:30):
I haven't tried that one yet, but it might be something we try next.

Lenny (01:02:34):
Last question. You've been at LinkedIn for a long time. I imagine you use LinkedIn a lot. Is there just a pro tip that you can share of how to be more successful with LinkedIn, find more value in LinkedIn, enjoy it more?

Hari Srinivasan (01:02:47):
The first is, I do think certainly there's ways, and the majority of ways that skills work is we infer skills. But I think that there is a skills section on the profile. I think a lot of people ignore it because they don't realize that there's value in it. That's changing, but I'm not sure if it's changing for everybody. I would pay more attention to skills as we get more into the skills-first stuff.

(01:03:05):
The second thing I would probably do, I don't know if it's that hidden, but I would check out LinkedIn Learning. I do think LinkedIn Learning is a gem. I think because it's sold largely through enterprises, a lot of people miss it. I would hope you check it out. But more importantly, tell me areas that we could get better on there as well. I hope that people will find value there.

Lenny (01:03:22):
What's the best way to find out about LinkedIn Learning? They just Google LinkedIn Learning and they'll find the-

Hari Srinivasan (01:03:26):
Yeah. Or go to LinkedIn/learning. Yeah.

Lenny (01:03:30):
Linkedin.com/learning? Okay. Great. Hari, I feel like we've opened the Mind of Hari up on this podcast. I appreciate you being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Hari Srinivasan (01:03:42):
Well, you can find me on LinkedIn. That's an easy one. I do really, really, really appreciate product feedback. I promise you I take it well, for those listening. And two, going back to the heart of this conversation around complexity, it is really hard to know sometimes what everyone's experience is because you're living in a very abstracted ecosystem. The more you could just say, hey, this is working or not, and the intentions are coming from a good place, and if you have a moment and you're not having a great experience, or you are having a great experience, you could write it. I really would appreciate to hear your perspective.

Lenny (01:04:15):
Amazing. Hari, thank you so much for being here.

Hari Srinivasan (01:04:18):
Thanks, Lenny. It's great meeting you.

Lenny (01:04:20):

## Transcript

Heidi Helfand (00:00:00):
Reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer, so let's focus there too.

Lenny (00:00:25):
Today my guest is Heidi Helfand. After two decades in the tech industry, Heidi became fascinated with how teams are organized, how org structures change and how to set teams up for success through that change. She now teaches workshops and runs courses and consults on how to effectively reorganize your teams. And in her book Dynamic Reteaming, Heidi delves deep into why change is actually good for your teams, why you're better off not having super stable teams, how to effectively execute reorgs, and through that, how to reduce attrition, stagnation, and knowledge silos. In our conversation, Heidi shares the five types of reteaming, anti-patterns to avoid when making org changes, what sort of team structure is most conducive to creating totally new products, why being transparent about your reorg plans is definitely worth considering. Also, how Heidi became such a great listener with a lot of really interesting insights and advice there and so much more. Huge thank you to John Cutler for introducing me to Heidi. With that, I bring you Heidi Helfand after a short word from our sponsors.

Heidi, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Heidi Helfand (00:03:45):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (00:03:47):
It's great to have you here. So I had this colleague at Airbnb, her name was Jana, and she always had this joke that she shared that if it's been six months and she hasn't switched teams or hasn't moved desks, she knew there was this reorg coming, there's something happening, something was coming to change everything. And you wrote a whole book about this general idea of teams changing, reorgs, you call reteaming. I have the book right here. It's called Dynamic Reteaming: The Art and Wisdom of Changing Teams. I feel like just people underestimate the opportunities and benefits of change, and I think that we see it as a scary thing. So I'm really excited to spend time with you and chat about this topic. Before we get into the meat of it, I'm just curious why you decided to spend so much of your time researching this area of team change, reorgs, reteaming.

Heidi Helfand (00:04:35):
Yeah, that's a good question. It wasn't necessarily planned. I had been working in a variety of different fast-growing startups for most of my career in 20 years in software-as-a-service companies in particular. And I read a lot of books to try to get better at my work and what we're doing in our teams. I have a lot right over there as you can see, and a lot of the books I would read on teams and the advice that I would get from people would be, you really want to keep your teams the same. You want to go for that forming, storming, norming, performing kind of thing. And I had thought about that and I was like, wait, well it wasn't really possible for us when I was at a startup and I was the 10th employee and we grew to 900 people and now thousands of people, our team's kind of morphed and changed.

(00:05:28):
So I feel like if you're in a fast-growing company or a shrinking company, look there, don't look at trying to fight the natural evolution. I was just trying to prove a point and to illustrate that teams change. And I was also curious to see, well, was that just my experience and the experience of my colleagues in Southern California? What is it like for other people? So I was just curious.

Lenny (00:05:56):
You have this code in your book where you say something like, sure, we deliver software on time, we make products people love and want to buy, but there's this people layer that happens that people may not be thinking enough about. Is there anything more you can say to that?

Heidi Helfand (00:06:11):
Yeah, I think a lot of the things that I would read about teams just are naturally focused on, well, you want to build things that customers love. You want it to be an enjoyable experience, you want to deliver on time. There's a reason we're there as a business, but there's also a lot of company building that happens in building the people structures and just when you go from one to many to a multitude, there's a lot of work that goes into it. This is enablement type work and it's where I focused a lot of my time and my career helping make teams and organizations successful. So there is this people layer, however, I've thought about this a lot over the years and I think it would be highly convenient if we could just focus on building products that people love and getting product market fit, talking to customers.

(00:07:06):
It would be great if it could only be that, but the reality is we're humans together and there's a lot of opportunity to build companies that delight people where they're excited to be included in decision-making about how the organization grows and changes or shrinks. So yeah, there's this whole kind of other area of work that I think just doesn't get enough attention and I guess that's where I live and breathe.

Lenny (00:07:38):
Awesome. Okay, so I definitely want to get into the five types of reteaming as you described, but before we get there, what I find with reorgs and change is that it often leads to the biggest career opportunities because there's new roles to be filled. If things aren't changing, there's not going to be all of a sudden, "Hey, we have this new role that we want for you." I don't know. A lot of the leaders that move up quickly are the ones that seem to take advantage of change and think ahead and get involved and position themselves in a way where like, "Okay, cool, there's a new position. Oh, clearly it's going to be Heidi." Is there anything you can share there? Any advice for people that maybe see reorgs coming and what they can do to help themselves in that pending change?

Heidi Helfand (00:08:21):
I really like it when there's transparency in reorgs. There's a story in my book from Christian Lima at Spotify about how they reorged a large infrastructure team. They visualized it on whiteboards and brought people over to the whiteboards to see the future team structure that the leaders wanted and they got input into the design. We did this at Procore as well inspired by Christian and his story and we had... I think there were 80 people involved in this platform organization that was splitting from two large clusters of teams into three. And I remember when we rolled out the whiteboards from a back office where we were talking about this change for a few weeks and it was scary to roll these whiteboards out because it impacts people's day to day. It's like when somebody is suggesting that maybe you do something different or that something different happens, sometimes it can be kind of triggering. You want to know what's going on. So anyway, but we had courage together.

(00:09:31):
So we rolled these whiteboards out and it had the team structure with everyone's names on it. It had the name of the team, the mission of the team, how many open slots for hiring across all of these different teams, and then people's names in their existing team positions. And people were invited to look, give feedback. They identified mistakes that we had in the design, "Oh, this team might be better over here and here's why." And people had the opportunity to see opportunities within their own company that they might say, "Hey, I'm interested in this, might I be considered for this?" And then they could have their discussion. So I really liked that the opportunities were shared and presented, so it wasn't some sort of thing that happened in some kind of back room for the whole time. We unearthed the beginning of a plan.

(00:10:31):
I think sometimes when you convene people for a meeting to talk about anything, it's good to have a starting point. So we had this starting point, we had a variety of different things and I call it whiteboard reteaming in my book and I write about that. And there's even structures that are more open than that. Redgate Software in Cambridge UK. Chris Smith is a colleague of mine and they do regular open self-selection reteaming activities when they're changing their strategic priorities. He talks about this globally very interesting space and it's even more open than putting the names on the whiteboards. They have teams give pitches and this is what they're looking for and they have a whole method for enabling people to say, "Hey, I'm interested in this." I think that really helps because sometimes you might think, "Oh, no one's going to want to work on this." But people can be delighted by working on things that another person doesn't think are particularly interesting.

(00:11:38):
So giving choice is important. And again, there are different grades of transparency. We weren't up for doing this kind of open reteaming self-selection event, but we were open to the whiteboard variant.

Lenny (00:11:56):
I imagine individual employees hearing this of just being involved in the reorg strategy sounds amazing. Executives and leaders hearing this are probably really afraid and feel like there's no way this can work well. And so what I want to understand is how do you actually set this up for success? What I'm imagining when you do this is many people disagree. There's teams people want to join, there's teams people don't want to join. It seems like there's a consensus challenge where do you wait for everyone to agree? Does someone end up making a decision? Does it distract everyone from the work they're doing when you're kind of involving everyone in the reorg? Versus what typically happens, it secretly is planned amongst executives. No one knows it's coming. And I think the reason they do that is because they don't want to distract anyone and they don't want anyone to start freaking out until it's like, "Here's the final plan. Here's what we're doing." So what other advice do you have for people that want to practice this way of reteaming and reorging where they involve the actual team in the plan?

Heidi Helfand (00:12:58):
There's a book by William Bridges called Transitions: Managing Life's Changes. I have it right here. Making Sense of Life's Changes. He talks about endings, neutral zone, and new beginning. Ending: you're going through a change, your team is changing. Neutral zone: the period of kind of liminality where you're like, "Gosh, I don't know how this is going to go." You're not quite comfortable. You're not quite in that new reality yet. You're still thinking about what it was like before. And once you're in that new reality and leaders can paint the vision and picture about the benefits of the new reality and the purpose and why we're here and anchor to that to try to raise positivity. But once I learned about that transition framework, going through any subsequent changes myself became a lot easier to grasp and it really kind of makes changes in any part of your life. I mean, his book is not written about software development or product development.

(00:14:00):
Sometimes we're going to have a say, we're going to be able to participate, sometimes we're not. And being clear on who the decision maker is in a change is really important.

(00:14:11):
There's another framework that I really like. I don't think it's in my book, but I've written about it in my new book, but it's called RIDE. And we had a chief people officer at Procore and she's now at UKG, Pat Wadors. She taught us the RIDE framework for decision making clarity and it's who's requesting the change, who can give input to the change, who's the decider on the change, and who's going to execute on the change? So it's like R-I-D-E. And I googled this for a while; I couldn't find anything on it. I encouraged her to write about it and I credit her to that, Pat Wadors. She's awesome.

(00:14:53):
So a lot of the times it's like, what's the problem you're going to solve? You have a current state and a future state and that future state might be up to discussion, but maybe it's not depending on what it is. You're getting acquired, you're probably not going to have a standup meeting and talk about should we get acquired or not? No, you're not part of that decision. And then how's the change going to get rolled out or how are we going to do it?

(00:15:22):
In other cases at the team level, maybe you have a retrospective and you determine, "Hey, I think we'd be a bit more effective and we'd be able to deliver at a better cadence if we were two teams instead of one team." And if teams have the ability to talk about that and impact and have some agency into how their part of the org evolves and change, I think that could be really cool. I think that could be really empowering. I think that could help us feel more ownership in that company that we're in. It doesn't always have to be like decision making equals hierarchy or the person at the top. It doesn't have to be like that.

(00:16:01):
But again, reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with, oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. It's not. But anyway, we need to focus there. We got to focus on this people layer because reteaming is inevitable. We might as well get better at it because we're going to have to deal with it. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer. So let's focus there too.

Lenny (00:16:37):
On this transparent collaborative reteaming, final question here is just would you recommend time boxing this so that it doesn't suck up everyone's brain power for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it very dependent?

Heidi Helfand (00:16:48):
Yeah, you got to time box it.

Lenny (00:16:52):
Okay. Is there advice you have on how long?

Heidi Helfand (00:16:53):
Make a schedule biased towards shorter as opposed to longer. You don't want to deliberate on this forever, because especially as you include more people, it can be distracting. So you want to proceed as expediently as you can.

Lenny (00:17:10):
Okay, let's talk about the types of reteaming. This is kind of the core of your book and we haven't even gotten there yet. So you've identified there's five ways teams change. Can you just walk through them, help people understand what they are. And then also, we use this term reorg a lot in this conversation. I think that's the way most people think about change. After we go through this list, what does reorg refer to when it's maybe from the perspective of these five ways of teams changing?

Heidi Helfand (00:17:32):
Sure. Okay, so the five patterns of reteaming. One by one, someone joins your company or someone leaves your company, grow and split. It's a growth pattern. Teams grow bigger and then they split into two or more teams. Opposite of grow and split is merging. Sometimes two or more teams merge together. It's more of a shrinking pattern. We might be seeing more of this these days as companies downsize. Things merge together and consolidate. Isolation is, or innovation by isolation. Start a new team off to the side, a beneficial silo, give that team process freedom, great for catalyzing new product lines within your existing company. Also great for emergencies and they just happen anyway if we have incidents and people have to come together, solve an incident and then go back to their teams. And switching. So switching is moving from one team to another team. You can do this at a variety of cadences, short term, long term.

(00:18:36):
And then difference between a reteaming and a reorg. I think reorg is a word that has very traditional baggage and connotations. And when I was writing Dynamic Reteaming, it just didn't feel like an appropriate word to use for, well, Sue is looking to learn a little bit about how our web operations work, she's going to move to that team. It didn't feel appropriate to call that a reorg because Sue's moving and switching from one team to the next. I think reorg again... Reorganization is a traditional word. It implies on the large, it implies top-down changes that you have say no. It's something different than what I consider reteaming, which is these five patterns that happen at different levels.

Lenny (00:19:30):
Awesome. So let me just repeat back these five. So one by one, basically people joining your team, leaving your team, something very natural. People do all the time.

Heidi Helfand (00:19:37):
Your company.

Lenny (00:19:39):
Or your company, yeah. Growing, splitting a team gets really large and then it's like, okay, let's just split this into two, focus them on specific things instead of this one team trying to cover too much. Merging teams, the opposite of that. Isolation. I want to chat about that one a little more where you just have a team off to the side and they're just dedicated to something that you find really important. So with isolation, you have this awesome story of your time at a company called Expertcity, which turned into something people know most likely and ended up being a great outcome because of this reteaming into an isolation team. Could you talk about that?

Heidi Helfand (00:20:14):
Yeah, so I've been at different startups that have grown bigger and one of them, I was the 15th employee. I started as a web editor and became an interaction designer. And we were going to change the world and it was very exciting. We were in Santa Barbara, California. So the company's called Expertcity. And we were working on our first product, which was a marketplace for tech support. So imagine you have a problem on your computer, you can go to our website and then you can select an expert to see and control your screen to help you solve your tech support challenge. And so we had the screen sharing technology that we were inventing in the company. We had the web-based software to manage the interaction between the customer and the expert. We had the experts. We had in-house experts and then the vision was global worldwide experts. You were going to be like this marketplace, this eBay of services is what we talked about in the early days. I was really into this.

(00:21:17):
This was my first job in tech and I became an interaction designer working on kind of front-end UI flows with engineers. It's actually before the word interaction designer, my title was navigation designer. We made this up. So I was very into... It was before the words like UX and other things. People were talking about information architecture and other sub-genres of design. And we had individual offices. I had all the interaction flows on my walls. I was really into the words and one day I was in there and we were working on a new flow. We had all these hopes and dreams for this product and the CEO came into my office and he said, "Heidi, stop working on the marketplace. We're not going to do that product anymore. We're killing it because nobody's buying it and made six bucks or something last month." And he said, "Go to the beach." We were by Santa Barbara. I'm like, "What do you mean go to the beach?" He's like, "Well, I don't want you to start any work that you're going to have to maintain later as we figure out our next step." And I was like, "Okay."

(00:22:29):
I remember that day and I'm looking around my office and all these flows on the walls. So really these were domains like domain-driven design. It was all these web domains and which user interactions were going to happen and all these hopes and dreams and it was the first time in my career where we were told not to work on something. It wasn't paused. Some people say, "Oh, we're going to pause this," and then they never get back to it. This thing was like [inaudible 00:22:59]. And I didn't get it. I just didn't get it. I cried, I acted out, I sent this email like, "How can we kill the marketplace? It must live." It was quite an experience.

(00:23:14):
But then, and I don't know what the timing was, I was invited to be on this team off to the side and there was market validation going on. Our founders and product and others became students of market validation, Four Steps to the Epiphany. So we had built this thing, we spent all this time on this marketplace, but nobody would buy it. And so it was like do or die. We had to shift. This was before lean startup. So Four Steps to the Epiphany was the book, it was the manual, it was guiding the way. And so there were people that had a ton of conversations with potential customers about this new thing that we were going to build.

(00:23:58):
And so I was invited to be at this team off to the side and there was a small team and we didn't have to do waterfall software development. We were freed from that. We were liberated from that. We got to work in other ways. And I remember working with an engineer and we were figuring out how to create a forgot password flow because none of these patterns existed back then and we got to do this stuff. We got to deploy more frequently and the product was called GoToMyPC where you could see and operate someone's computer from a distance. And that was essentially the pivot that I feel like saved the company. Later we went on, we got folded back into the teams and we built GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar as a technical project manager at that time. So taking a team off to the side, giving that team process freedom. They didn't want us distracted from the drag.

(00:24:58):
When you're working on an existing product line, you get this cadence and it can become a mature cadence. Maybe people work in two weeks or one week now, but when you're working on something new, you need faster iteration loops. And our founders knew that need. So it was a privilege and I was delighted to be part of this other team and it was really, really exciting. So then looking back over the years, I was like, yeah, isolated teams, beneficial silos. Again, it's going against green of what some of these books say, oh, you want to desilo everything? No, sometimes there's a reason why you have a problem. You want to solve the problem. This was like, I mean, was this company going to go under? I didn't think of those kind of things at the time because I was just super into the work and very passionate and motivated about what we were building. But yeah, isolation pattern came up and we used it at another startup as well ever since.

(00:25:59):
So yeah, that's the story of Expertcity and from my perspective. Ask different people at different vantage points, but that... If we would've stayed within our teams and we would've had to develop with pixel-perfect mockups done in Photoshop like, "Here you go," I don't think we would've been fast enough. That was not good for the innovation that we needed. So it's also like innovation by isolation. It's good for emergencies. I was at another startup, we had performance issues with our first product. People left teams, brought a consultant in, went into a conference room for a couple of weeks, figured out some major changes that needed to happen, solve them, went back to the teams. This is not a new concept. The Chicken McNugget was saved by an isolated team, SWAT team.

(00:26:57):
There's a book called Teamwork. It's an old book from, I think the '70s, I have in my bookshelf here, and there's a story of the Chicken McNugget that you can read about where they brought in a consultant and had a very small team who worked in a different... They didn't work in their same plant where they were developing the product. They worked in a different plant. They reported straight up to one of the executives at McDonald's. And yeah, the Chicken McNugget lived on because it was like having challenges in the test marketplace in Indianapolis. So we didn't make this up. It's just like some of these things are kind of like, "Oh, it's like a noticing," and then you're like, "Oh, that's pattern." So it's collection.

Lenny (00:27:39):
There's this idea of a startup within a big company. Everyone's like, "Oh, it's just like the startup within a big company. We have all the resources that we need. There's no less risk, but we can innovate and try new things." Rarely does it feel like it work out. You're sharing stories where it does. Is there anything you found or any advice for how to actually be successful in this idea of having a team off to the side doing something innovative and different?

Heidi Helfand (00:28:00):
At AppFolio we did this. So there's a company called SecureDocs; it branched off into its own company and it was just acquired, I believe in 2022. When SecureDocs was happening, I was not on that team. I was on the other teams and I was watching, and again, same pattern. A team was created off to the side and they were given process freedom. They worked in more of a daily sprint style as opposed to the two-week sprint style that our other teams were doing at the time at early AppFolio. And so, one, isolate the team or put them in a different area. We could still see them. We were in this big open room, but it was their team area. I mean we had these impermanent walls between some of the teams. It was their region and they claimed it and they named themselves.

(00:28:58):
And so, one, separate location. There's another story in the book about a team that incubated a product idea within Citrix and they were in a garage of all places, so they were really isolated. But just put the team in a different region, make it that area. That's number one.

(00:29:17):
Number two, tell other people not to disturb this team. That's key. And hearing it from a leader is really, really important. No, you're not going to pull them into something else. They're working on this other thing. So people need to shed their skin of the other things that they're working on. If you take a bigger picture, kind of forest through the trees picture, you want people pairing and switching pairs so they're not single owners of the system. So when they have an opportunity to do something that could be really important to the company beyond one of these isolated teams, they can fade out and not be the only owner that has to transfer knowledge and then field questions for two years on how that system works. You want to build this redundancy in your teams. So that's like if you really want to plan ahead, do that first. Have that as part of how you operate, building this team redundancy and switching, because then it frees people to not be the only owner of a system and chained to a system.

(00:30:15):
And so isolate them. Tell people not to bother them. Do pairing and have shared ownership so it's easier for somebody to switch into something like this. Process freedom. Again, they can do things differently. Ideally they report up to someone that really has decision-making authority and decisions won't get reversed. Or they have to go through some complex web of like, "Is it okay if we do this?" No, you need a clear decision-making structure. They saw that at the McDonald's case study as well, which is not in my book, but it's in [inaudible 00:30:52] book called Teamwork.

(00:30:53):
And then that group, having that senior leader that they report into, getting the clear lines of communication there is also really important. So not having this heavyweight bureaucracy of, I don't know, quarterly business updates where everybody's making a slide deck for two years before they go to that meeting, trying to relieve the team of things like that and make it lighter.

(00:31:25):
And some of these teams, like SecureDocs became another product at AppFolio that was very, very successful. At one point, I think it was before we went public, it branched off into its own separate entity. I think maybe they shared a board member or something. I don't know how that worked, but it became its own entity. SecureDocs became separate and then it grew from there. And then it became this wonderful successful product that was recently acquired. People come and go at companies and companies grow and change and morph, and that was one case of departures that it's like bitter, sweet. You're happy for your friends and colleagues say, "Oh, he's going to be a CTO. He's going to be the CTO."

(00:32:14):
There's this entity. I remember visiting their office in Santa Barbara. It's great to see your friends succeed and thrive. And we developed other companies in that way.

Lenny (00:32:28):
Awesome. I think it's really nice to hear there's many success stories of this idea of a mini little startup within a company, and these are really good tips.

(00:33:27):
I feel like to me one of the most important ones you've talked to. And this is having an executive essentially sponsoring this team and supporting and protecting it versus some managers just like, now we're going to go do this off to the side, because otherwise no one's going to really take that seriously.

Heidi Helfand (00:33:43):
Yeah, I think that's really, really important. I'll also say that things don't always succeed a hundred percent. I've seen isolated teams within companies where someone has the opportunity to sell something, they talk to their friends who are the engineers who build the feature for them, but then it leaves something for other people to maintain later and they weren't involved in the decisions. And it can be a big mess for all of these patterns there. It's like kind of like balconies and basements. You can screw it up too. It's not all stuff is hard. That's why I like to lean into it and I've written about it. Things take effort. The tree is going to drop the leaves and you got to sweep them up. Everything takes work and effort.

Lenny (00:34:33):
We've talked about the isolation pattern. I thought it'd be good to talk through the rest of the patterns real quick and share maybe one or two tips for how to be successful or make it work well or better.

Heidi Helfand (00:34:45):
Sure.

Lenny (00:34:46):
Before you start, actually, I think I missed a nuance and you corrected me, but I think I missed it, which is for the one-on-one pattern, it's actually describing joining the company specifically not joining a team. Is that right?

Heidi Helfand (00:34:56):
Yeah. And in the book it might be a little blurred because this is like some of the... Switching and one by one sound very similar, and they do have some Venn diagram overlaps, but I'll distinguish them as I talk about them.

Lenny (00:35:11):
Cool.

Heidi Helfand (00:35:12):
So one by one, someone joins your company or they leave your company. So the tip with one by one is when someone joins, help them feel a sense of belonging, and you can do that through not having their first day be them sitting over there alone. You could have someone have a first pair. There's a chapter in my book about onboarding. This is in the space of onboarding. Also with one by one, when people join, you also need to pay attention to the people who are already there and it's good for them to know when someone is joining the company; that it shouldn't be a surprise. So visualizing the hiring and the opportunities is something that I think is a really good idea. It could be challenging for someone if somebody joins and they become their manager, but what if that person wanted to be the manager and then they brought in someone from the outside to become the manager?

(00:36:08):
So you need to pay attention to the new hires that are joining, help them feel a sense of belonging, get them to talk about themselves, which is said to increase their sense of connection and retention. There's some research in the book The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle, which talks about that. But then it's also important to coach the people through change that are already at the company, especially if they weren't involved in the particular decision, bringing on this new leader that comes in and brings in all their people. So you got to pay attention to different people.

(00:36:45):
Grow and split is a natural thing that happens when you're like startup scale up and growing bigger and bigger. The first team probably grows bigger and then splits into two or three. So when the team gets bigger, facilitation and communication tends to break down. So some signals that teams might bring up when they feel like a change might be helpful is the meetings are taking longer. You're in that case where it's harder to make decisions. It was easier when there were like five of us, but now they're 13. The work becomes divergent. They're working on this one thing, they're working on something else. No one's paying attention in the standup so much anymore because this work has diverged. And those are a few of the signals. And then someone typically brings it up. If you normalize the idea that it's okay for teams to have input into their future structures, maybe they'll bring it up and decide that, "Hey, it might be better if we split."

(00:37:52):
Sometimes splitting though can create dependencies that weren't there when you were together as one team. So you inherit other problems or you might inherit challenges like, all right, the team decides it's far effective if they split into two or three, but we just have one product manager, we just have one designer. We just have one person who helps us anticipate quality challenges. So it's a lot of problem trading when you do a lot of this stuff. Like anything, you have a challenge, how might we solve it? Well, there's option A, option B and option C. So that's grow and split and it's very common I think when your company is growing and changing, kind of like that.

(00:38:37):
Merging is the opposite of grow and split. Two or more teams combine together. Or at a higher level, a company acquires another company and then there's a merging that happens. So merging I think is related to when companies downsize or shrink, things consolidate, come together, or again, when at the company level companies combine, one acquires another, gets acquired. How that goes down varies, but there's this concept called panarchy that I write about in my book that a lot of these changes is changes at the individual level, the team level, the team of teams level, department level, the company level. So yeah, merging. So there's a business decision that the companies merge together and then changes might ensue.

(00:39:28):
So maybe the company wants to get ahead on building and having another vertical in their SaaS company. We acquired a company at AppFolio to bring us faster into workflow software for law firms. So we acquired a company based in San Diego, and that got us a couple of years ahead. I remember one of the leaders saying that. So again, we weren't involved... I wasn't involved in this decision as an IC at the time. So it could be a business decision for merging at that level. It could be that people leave, there are departures and teams and responsibilities consolidate together. That's merging. So it could be that kind of shrinking that we're seeing. It could be that the company is having one leader instead of three and there's a consolidation and the teams kind of merge together. So it's the opposite of grow and split.

(00:40:23):
One activity I do like to do with teams that merge is called story of our team. That's in chapter 13 of the second edition. So with story of our team, each team makes a timeline of... They stand in order of when they joined their team and they make a timeline with milestones of when they joined their team, when people left, and significant events and things they created that they're excited about and that they're proud of. And that they branch together with their newly merged team, and then it's good to get a shared sense of history. So you have these teams or companies that come together, they make shared timelines, they share their milestones and things that they built that they're proud of. They tell each other about it and then they have a sense of like, "Wow, we didn't know that. Oh, I didn't know that you had built a system like that. We did too." Or, "We've never built anything like that. That is so cool. What did you learn from that?" We get to learn about each other and then we're together. We're like, "All right, we're this merged entity now. What's next?" Looking out to the future so we have the same shared vision. So I love doing that. There's different tactics you can do before, during, and after each of these patterns. Yeah, that's merging.

(00:41:46):
Isolation we talked about before. Put the team up to the side, give them process freedom, have them report up to a decision maker, tell the other teams not to bother them. Let them work at the cadence that they want to work at. That makes it easier. If you are doing a short-term thing, you got to work it out with the larger entity so you don't create something in isolation that other people have to maintain. There's ways that this can be messed up.

(00:42:15):
And then switching. Switching pattern is really tied to learning and development and fulfillment. It could be that you want to work with other people. Like forming, storming, norming, performing, Tuckman's model, he forgot the phase called stagnating. Sometimes it feels like we're in a team for too long. We're tired of working with these people. We want a little variety. We want to work with that person over there. Or maybe we want to work on a new system. We don't have the opportunity to do that in our current team, but what if we could work on that system over there with those people? It could totally refresh us. It could be like having a new job within our same company. It could extend the lifespan of the amazing employee in your company. So switching is tied to that kind of fulfillment, which is one of the reasons why I made it separate from one by one and tied that to the company.

(00:43:11):
The other thing with switching is that you could create safety nets in your company through switching. I just wrote a newsletter post about this yesterday because maybe we're going to have some more changes this year. Maybe companies are going to be hiring less. I don't like the thought of companies downsizing or having layoffs or anything like that, but I think to myself, well, have multiple owners of a system. So not only one person is that tower of knowledge that owns that one system. There's some stories in my book where I interviewed Richard Sheridan, who is the chief storyteller and co-founder of a wonderful company called Menlo Innovations in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They built their company Menlo to have people work in pairs. Not just the software engineers; team members work in pairs and they switch pairs at a regular cadence. And you know that when you're joining the company because you're involved in some kind of pairing. So there's parity from when you're interviewing to when you're at the company.

(00:44:14):
But switching also helps build that knowledge redundancy in your company. A little more about tolerance. So if someone leaves, they don't leave with all the information in their head. We had that. At that first startup Expertcity, we had some single owners of systems and when they left, it just becomes a challenge and a setback. And at AppFolio we shared a founder between the first startup and the second startup. Many of their early engineers from that first startup went to the second startup.

(00:44:50):
I was 10th at AppFolio. I was 15th at Expertcity. So we wanted to work together. So it was that global idea of switching one by one or similar. But anyway, at the second startup we had the chance to do things differently. So we had pairing and switching pairs and test-driven development. We had help to do that, but this kind of redundancy built safety into our systems, especially when AppFolio is processing a lot of rent payments. There's a lot of money. There's ACH going through. Those are critical systems and it's very important that things are safe and secure. You don't want to haphazardly switch people around. You can screw this up, again, that balconies and basements concept. You don't want somebody over here, they will switch every two weeks and have no say in their team. There's ways to screw all of this up, but there's other ways to do it well.

(00:45:48):
I remember when we were at our first team at AppFolio and we did a grow and split. It grew and it split into two or three teams. I remember there was a loss for some of the engineers who wanted to pair program with some of the other engineers, and they started a regular rotation themselves from one team to the next, and that brought fulfillment. It brought joy. I mean they would see each other in the workspace every day, but they wanted to work together. It brought them learning joy and fulfillment, and I love that. For those who are like keep the team stable and the same forever, I'm like, "Well, what about that?" It brings me satisfaction and joy when I see my colleagues. It's like autonomy, mastery, purpose, like Dan Pink's book Drive, when people are really given some agency and the opportunity to work a little bit differently than maybe that traditional boxed version you might see on my bookshelf. You can really create not only products that people love, but companies that people love and want to be at.

Lenny (00:47:03):
All these stories of team changes and reorg, it made me think about a quote that one of my managers always used to say about reorging and changing teams is that there's no perfect org structure. There's only the best idea you have at the time for what the org could be. And then there's the issues with that org that you identify as you're putting in place and then set up processes and systems around to try to catch that dependencies, as you said, or overlap of ownership. Is there anything along those lines that comes up of just things you found of just like, there's never going to be the perfect way to do it. This is just our best idea at the time and here's how we deal with the downsides of this approach?

Heidi Helfand (00:47:41):
Yeah, I think there's a lot of wisdom to what your manager said and your colleague there because yeah, I mean as time goes on, conditions change. We evolve and change. We're subject to different influences. COVID happens. We weren't dealing with that 10 years ago. We grow and adapt and morph. We try to get together and make the best decisions that we can when we're faced with challenges, and a lot of it is problem trading. We have this challenge today. We decide, oh, there's a few ways we could handle this. Pros and cons of each solution. It's like the Toyota Kata, like grasp the current condition. You'll experience you have challenges. What's the next evolution or the next target condition? How might you get there? And then you're there and you're like, okay, grasp the current target condition. What's it like? What are you experiencing? Oh, we might try this. We're always transforming from the current state to the future state.

(00:48:54):
So to that, I would ask people, well, how do you want that to be? And how do you want to show up and be as a leader? You want to just be like, "All right, I've got to get this done. The reorg is done by an email and we're just sending it out, or this small team change. And here it is; it's done. Goodbye." Or is it a little bit where you get people's input? And that in itself, you got to weigh what you're dealing with, again. But I like to think about that. What kind of leader do you want to be? Leaders need patience. It's hard to be a leader. It's challenging, but what kind of an environment or vibe do you want to cultivate in your teams and what do you want the people to be like?

(00:49:42):
I have a degree in teaching English and applied linguistics, and I remember studying Paulo Freire and other educational problem-posing methods of education. We have these teams that solve these complex problems and challenges and build these really cool things for customers. Let's involve them in some of the org decisions that are going to be part of their daily life. Really, you like that idea. Again, it's not perfect. You can't involve people on everything, especially if they're wide-scale changes that you just can't.

Lenny (00:50:19):
Along these lines of doing things badly sometimes, you have this whole section on anti-patterns of reteaming. I think there's about five of them. I don't know if you have these all top of mind, but if you do, I'd love to hear some anti-patterns.

Heidi Helfand (00:50:34):
Yeah. Well, one of them is people always think that reteaming is, you have a pool of people and you're assigning them to a bunch of different projects like, "Okay, you'll work 10% on this one, 5% on this one, 20% on this one. We are going to allocate the resources from our component-based teams into these different projects." We did that in Waterfall like many years ago, but that doesn't really work. A lot of the times the percentages don't add up. It's very hard for people to multitask and be involved in multiple efforts at once. It's hard for the brain with all the context switching that needs to happen in that case. So I call that the percentage anti-pattern.

(00:51:15):
There's also, I probably wrote about it like, poof, they're gone or suddenly they're here. Reteaming or having people suddenly show up and you weren't expecting them or suddenly they're gone and there's no communication around it whatsoever, that's another anti-pattern.

Lenny (00:51:32):
One of the ones I love is this idea of spreading high performers. This idea of we're going to spread the high performers across other teams.

Heidi Helfand (00:51:38):
That's an AppFolio story. Jon Walker was telling me back in the day that... I mean, he did this experiment. He had this thought that many of... There's one team that was like, I guess they were delivering at this cadence that they loved and they were building this stuff and there's this energy and you can almost feel it. Like let's just spread the people from that team across the other ones and then we'll have that. And it didn't work. He didn't have that. It didn't happen. And that was a visceral learning for him that it doesn't essentially work. And people are like, what does it take to be a high performing team? What does it take to have that magical team experience where there's that chemistry and the people are together? And there's stories in the book. Damon Valenzona was telling me one about how it's like's a band and we're with off each other. We're creating this music together. So John felt like he essentially destroyed that when he split up that team. So that's the story that inspired that anti-pattern.

Lenny (00:52:49):
The reason people are worried about reteams and reorgs is this... A lot of times it's exact reason that you just shared, which is our team is amazing. I don't want it to change. I don't want to split. I don't want to add anyone. I don't want to remove anyone. I guess is there anything else along those lines to help people feel better about, no, this is actually going to be okay and/or it's inevitable. It's not going to last.

Heidi Helfand (00:53:13):
I think sometimes you have that awesome team situation. It's an enjoyable experience. People are learning. You're looking forward to it every day. You're delivering the stuff that people love. You're telling people what's going on. You have that matched expectation where people aren't breathing down your neck because it's late or something. Sometimes you want to keep that team together. You don't want to destroy that dynamic. But the thing is, maybe that's a small startup that grows and you need to grow because you have a bigger vision and it needs to be more than these 10 people. And so there is sometimes this feeling of loss, like, "This is our company. This is my experience at this company of 10 people, but suddenly we're 20 people. It doesn't feel the same like it did anymore and it feels different."

(00:54:05):
And people, they always ask the question, "How do we maintain our culture? It feels different than it was before." The thing is, it is different, and our companies go through stages. The company of today is not the company it was a year ago. The people turn over and change, what we work on turns over and change. The whole world and industry and global events change and put different pressures on us, and we got to live in this global context. So nothing lasts. Sometimes I have a picture of myself holding an ice cream cone that's melting. Not to be a total downer, but appreciate it when you're on a team and you love it and it's amazing because these are our lives and we have to have gratitude and appreciate what we have because naturally things evolve and change. It's just inevitable. So we appreciate what we have.

(00:55:07):
A lot of us can look back on our careers and remember those times when we were, in my case, skipping through the halls because I was so happy. And I was like I couldn't even tell you. Well, why was I skipping through the halls at that moment? What was it? Well, it was the people and the conditions and what we were doing and the time, the era almost because yeah, it does change.

(00:55:30):
There's a book by Ichak Adizes called Managing Corporate Lifecycles. It's one that many of us read for years at AppFolio, maybe the previous company as well. The Adizes Institute influenced some of our leaders and they influenced us with this. And it talks about the different stages of companies from birth. There's go-go stage, maturity, death of companies. These are like lifecycles. The company grows and changes and morphs and changes. The people in the teams do that as well. I have an ecocycle in my book where I talk about that kind of aging and changing. Then there's a disruption and you have a new beginning. We're part of these stories that are in progress. This is not an unchanging, unmoving entity that we work in. So just be kind to each other, enjoy your experiences and learn as much as you can.

Lenny (00:56:30):
It reminds me of advice Sheryl Sandberg shared when she came to the Airbnb offices. Someone asked her: "What advice do you have to deal with all this constant change?" Like the quote I shared at the top of the episode of every six months, there's a massive reorg. Our culture's changing. Teams keep changing. It's constant flux. What is your advice to deal with that? And her advice was: That is good. The fact that you're growing so fast and having to change is the best case scenario because the alternative is you are not growing and it's much harder and much more painful because the changes are much harder. People get let go. Your business may go away. So her advice is just, this is good. Change means things are... And growth leads to change, especially hypergrowth, and that you should appreciate this time versus be afraid of it and think that it's a negative.

Heidi Helfand (00:57:23):
And it seems like she had such a wide vantage point and could see the forest through the trees of the fact that, well, this company's doing well and this is why we're growing and changing. And I remember one of my leaders, CTO Jon Walker, AppFolio, he told me that once too. He was like... I'd be having a problem or something and I'd come to him and he'd always say to me, "It's always great to be at a successful company, Heidi." And it's like, well, yeah, sometimes you don't think about the finances when you're in your day to day and you have a problem with another person or they come to you and they have a problem with this other person. But in the grand scheme of it, how is the company doing? It's really a critical vantage point that we need to remind ourselves of. But yeah, I wouldn't say all change is always good. Your mileage may vary there, but the general idea that the company is doing well, you're growing and changing, you're trying to make things happen, I think is definitely the space I'd rather be in than the opposite.

Lenny (00:58:31):
And I think it's especially true for people that haven't worked at a company that didn't work out where they think this sucks when really this is pretty good compared to all the things that could be happening.

Heidi Helfand (00:58:42):
Yeah, yeah, definitely. So we coach and help each other as we go along.

Lenny (00:58:48):
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Used to work with John Cutler, who was a previous guest on this podcast, and he had a question that he wanted me to ask you. He said that, "Heidi is one of the best listeners I've ever worked with." And so the question is, what's your secret to being a good listener?

Heidi Helfand (00:59:07):
Well, listening is a muscle to build and to always work on. You got to put your attention out. Focus on the other person. Sometimes if I'm looking down, maybe I reconnect and look at them. You got to read body language and other things. I'm trained as a co-active coach, which involves different levels of listening. So you have level one, which is internal listening. Like if you and I are talking, but I'm thinking about what am I going to have for lunch? I'm in level one. I've got to redirect it out to you and focus on you. So when I focus on you is I'm in level two listening. I'm putting my attention out and I'm really anchoring towards you. It's a coaching skill.

(00:59:47):
And then level three is global listening, environmental listening. If a marching band suddenly walked behind you, I'm going to point that out because it's in my field. I'm not going to ignore that. I'm going to bring that up. So we pay attention to the vibe and the feel in the room and where we're at. But then also if you're talking about something and suddenly you go like this or you have this kind of sudden pain in your neck when you're talking about this one thing, I might notice that you're doing this and touching your neck because that's information. That's a kind of listening, and so I might ask you about that. Or if the face turns red or you look down or away, it's another kind of listening. So Co-Active Training Institute, coactive.com is my co-active coaching training, so I learned it from them, Henry Kimsey-House and-

Lenny (01:00:48):
Wow, that is an awesome answer. There's a lot of depth there. So coactive.com, I'm going to check that out. So you actually got trained in this skill. Okay, that's great. That'll make people feel better. They're like, okay, amazing. I'm going to check this out. I'm going to try to be a better listener through the rest of this podcast episode from these tips.

Heidi Helfand (01:01:08):
I will say that sometimes I'm not a good listener though.

Lenny (01:01:13):
Yeah, so it goes. Heidi, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:22):
I don't think so. I really appreciate your questions and talking with you.

Lenny (01:01:28):
Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:34):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:39):
Leading Intelligent Teams is one, Liberating Structures is another one, and of course, Transitions by William Bridges. I also like the Leader's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making.

Lenny (01:01:53):
Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Heidi Helfand (01:01:57):
I did like The Bear, the cooking-related show, the restaurant-related show, and gets into the hospitality industry. I really like that. Movies, there isn't really one that stands out. I always look forward to being on an airplane to see what movies are playing, but no movie for you.

Lenny (01:02:21):
What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you are interviewing?

Heidi Helfand (01:02:27):
I always like to ask people, "Well, why do you want to join our company? What is it about working with us that would be exciting for you? Why our company as opposed to another one?"

Lenny (01:02:39):
What do you look for in their answer that is a good sign?

Heidi Helfand (01:02:43):
They have some knowledge about what we do, what we build. Maybe they bring up that they've noticed something on one of the websites or a product launch that we just announced, just that maybe it's part of their story in their career. They're going in this direction, and they heard about us and they thought, "Wow, I would love to work on that."

Lenny (01:03:08):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Heidi Helfand (01:03:11):
I'm very into vintage clothing and specifically real wool cashmere, not synthetic blends. I also like vintage blazers. A lot of the times where I'm giving a talk, I'm wearing a vintage blazer. I really like the clothing and design, and I kind of really, really love unusual vintage pieces that I could find, but they do need to... A lot of the fast fashion that's out there today is a lot of these blends with these materials that you've never heard of, but there's something special about vintage cashmere, for example.

Lenny (01:03:56):
Do you have a source for some good stuff? Is it like eBay? Is it stores locally? Is there a site? Is there somewhere you're finding some good stuff?

Heidi Helfand (01:04:03):
I travel around the world and I give talks on reteaming. I do workshops. And usually I go to vintage and antique stores. I was just in Berlin. I was doing that. I was doing it in London. And yeah, I love thrifting, Salvation Army, Goodwill, any of these places that we have in many of the US cities, the Humana line of stores that I've been to in Europe and other places. I try to find the small, unusual antique places as well. My aunt's an antique dealer in Michigan, and she doesn't specialize in vintage clothing, but I just love that idea of discovering unique and unusual things that maybe they remind you of times in the past. Maybe you find that, "Oh my gosh, we had that mug back in the '80s or whatever, or in the '90s." Things can kind of remind people of other times. So I like that. I think there's information stored in unique items.

Lenny (01:05:12):
Beautiful. I bet Berlin has some really cool vintage stuff, really wacky stuff.

Heidi Helfand (01:05:16):
Yeah, there's a lot of really interesting places to explore, and I think it's just so much more interesting than some of the brand new kind of stuff.

Lenny (01:05:30):
Agreed. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to or sharing with friends or family, either in work or in life?

Heidi Helfand (01:05:41):
I like asking people how can you be kind to yourself?

Lenny (01:05:47):
Say more.

Heidi Helfand (01:05:48):
I ask myself that too. I used to run a lot in Santa Barbara at Ellwood, which is a beautiful trail that you can go down to the ocean, you come back up. It's like More Mesa in Santa Barbara, and I would run and then I'd be like, "God, this is so hard." And then I would walk for a little while and I'd think to myself, "Well, how can I be kind to myself? I mean, what am I doing here? Does it have to be fast? No. I am here to decompress and enjoy, so how can I be kind to myself?" I think sometimes I get hard on myself or have very high expectations kind of achiever mentality, and I've learned through the years that it's okay to slow down. It's okay to not go, go, go the whole time. So I would ask other people that as well, especially if they're going through a challenge or burning midnight oil or whatever. It's like, "What about self-care? How can you be kind to yourself?"

Lenny (01:06:56):
Beautiful. Final question. I was scouring your LinkedIn and I saw a quote from the CTO of AppFolio in his endorsement of you. Said that you were the unofficial director of fun at AppFolio. Is there a story that comes to mind of something that you did at AppFolio that created a lot of joy and fun for the team?

Heidi Helfand (01:07:15):
We had these hack days, and I think they do that to this day. So twice a year we'd bring people together and we copied and learned from Atlassian. I remember we had calls with some coaches from Atlassian for how did they do their ShipIt Day, or they originally called it FedEx Day, changed it to ShipIt Day. We followed their model and we'd had this two o'clock on Thursday at two o'clock on Friday where we'd build whatever we wanted and we'd have a theme, and then we'd have goofy prizes at the end that were like traveling trophies. One of them was like a clickety-clack keyboard that we spray-painted gold by the railroad tracks, but people could work on anything. There were teams that formed... We did it with a self-selection marketplace. People formed their topics and teams, and one team hid geocaches throughout Santa Barbara. They're there to this day because we registered them with the Geocaching website. Another team built a vintage video game machine, and it was in the dev room. Another one they catapulted. They built this... Is it a trebuchet?

Lenny (01:07:16):
Yeah.

Heidi Helfand (01:08:27):
That catapult this fruit in the parking lot. I don't know how we got away with that, but we were in the early days. We did a lot of fun stuff like that, and you could work with different people, build these larger relationships, which later makes it easier for reteaming, because then later if you reteam, you're not strangers with people, so you want to cultivate the community. So we had this department of fun. We would plan the fun in a variety of other ways as well.

Lenny (01:08:56):
So fun. Heidi, you're awesome. I think we've helped a lot of people feel better about the endless change that they're probably going through right now. Two final questions. Where can folks find your book, find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Heidi Helfand (01:09:10):
You can go to heidihelfand.com or Google my name and I come up. Heidi@dynamicreteaming.com, heidi.helfand@gmail.com you can find me. I'm out there. And yeah, I love to work with companies and teams going through change, and I do that in a variety of ways. Teach workshops, do talks. So if any of this is interesting, reach out.

Lenny (01:09:33):
And then do you also consult and work with individual companies or not?

Heidi Helfand (01:09:37):
I do. Yeah. I do that now. I like to work on a retainer basis or I'll even join a team, so looking for the-

Lenny (01:09:37):
All right.

Heidi Helfand (01:09:45):
... next one.

Lenny (01:09:47):
Amazing. And we'll link to all this stuff in the show notes. Heidi, thank you again so much for being here.

Hila Qu (00:00:01):
... [inaudible 00:00:01]. Always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. So when you give away your free product, what you want to get in exchange are two things. One is a broader reach because free product spread itself is lower barrier to entry. Two, you want to understand you usage behavior of those free users, which features do they use and which features kind of correlates with a higher conversion rate, retention rate, all of that. If you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing.

Lenny (00:00:44):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Hila Qu. I've heard some listeners have been doing listening parties with this podcast where their team listens to an episode all at the same time over Zoom and shares their insights and lessons in a shared chat. And I would say that this episode is a great candidate for that. It's incredibly packed with advice on how to start and optimize your product led growth motion. We talk through common pitfalls that you probably run into or to get started, feel us favorite tools, what you recommends for an initial PLG oriented team, how to audit your existing funnel, plus tangents on how to improve your activation and retention and some foundational overviews of product like growth and some of the core concepts associated with it.

(00:01:34):
Like I say at the end of the episode, this episode delivers tens of thousands of dollars in value. Something you won't find for free anywhere else. I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Hila Qu after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:49):
This episode is brought to you by Amplitude. If you're setting up your analytics stack but not using Amplitude, what are you doing? Anyone can sell you analytics while Amplitude unlocks the power of your product and guide you every step of the way.

(00:02:16):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro and online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teens like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/Lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on.

(00:02:48):
For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board and with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all the aim Miro. Head on over to miro.com/Lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/Lenny.

(00:03:26):
Hila, welcome to the podcast.

Hila Qu (00:03:29):
Thank you Lenny for having me. I'm so excited.

Lenny (00:03:32):
I'm excited as well. I don't know if you know this, but you have the very unique distinction of having two posts in my top 25 most read post of all time in my newsletter, which are the two parts of your series on how to add a product led growth motion. And so I'm really excited to dig into product led growth and help more people be successful product led growth.

Hila Qu (00:03:52):
Awesome. I should have made it three posts, three part.

Lenny (00:03:57):
I like that ambition. There's always more. Yeah. Well I think the next milestone is get into the top 10, get two into the top 10.

Hila Qu (00:04:06):
Yes.

Lenny (00:04:06):
Okay. Maybe this podcast will... Oh, okay. This podcast will be in the feed of the newsletter, so maybe we'll get there. No pressure. No pressure. One question I wanted to ask you is anything come out of writing those guest posts? Has anything good happened as a result?

Hila Qu (00:04:21):
I always take a very long-term view for writing. I enjoy writing myself. Spend actually four months on that one. After it's published, I see a lot of shares kind of and people writing very long summary of it. That's always very encouraging and also many people I didn't expect reading it reach out to me, let me know, "Hey, I read that." For example. I think Ravi, he is also on your podcast. I didn't know him personally, one day he's like, "Hila, I read that. That's awesome." And a bunch of friends in VC and they kind of read that. They told me it's great. I even have a advisory client kind of landed because of that as well. So it's awesome.

Lenny (00:05:10):
Amazing. It makes me really happy to hear all that. I was also curious, has anything, and we're going to get into the details of all the stuff you wrote about and even beyond what you wrote about, but is there anything you're thinking has shifted on having after having written that series in terms of PLG?

Hila Qu (00:05:25):
I wouldn't say it's shifted completely because I always believe you don't need to be a PLG purist. Meaning there are kind of people who are like, "PLG is the future. It's only thing, you don't need sales." Right? I was never like that, but recently by working with a few of my clients, I witnessed in reality many startups actually are having both. They have a PLG motion, they have a sales team as well. PLG motion is perfect for lowering the barrier for more people to try, broader the reach. It's a kind of volume kind of game. And then the sales motion, you can have very targeted list of big customers you go after, you close them and it's a big order. Usually revenue, a very strong foundation for a company. And I've seen actually a lot of my clients that are doing, they have both. They're doing that. They try to get the benefit of both from their early stage and it's super cool.

Lenny (00:06:29):
Is the simple way to think about this trend that eventually every one will need to do both. It's not one or the other, it's just both. And it's just a matter of when you add the other.

Hila Qu (00:06:40):
I would think so because let's say if you are in the sales motion dominated kind of traditional B2B software industry, your competitors will be adding PLG, as soon as they add it they will have a benefit of attracting more end users and end users become case to the employer, to the clients. And you lose that. And if you are only in PLG somewhere else may go after the big customers. It takes time for PLG to go to the big customer and close them. So you lose a little bit of time there as well. I think eventually you need both.

Lenny (00:07:19):
Cool. That's kind of the way I've been seeing it. I did a few series on traditional product led growth companies, [inaudible 00:07:28]. All those guys, and they all add sales teams eventually last famous for being product led only. And so everyone ends up adding sales team. I think more recent trend is sales led enterprise E products are all just realizing they need a product led growth component. So that's kind of what I've been seeing too.

Hila Qu (00:07:43):
Yeah, exactly. But I would say it is easier if you have PLG from early on. If you are pure sales led, you try to add PLG, that's the harder thing to change basically.

Lenny (00:07:56):
Interesting to set a little foundation. Before we get into a lot of this stuff, it'd actually be helpful just to explain what is product like growth, just simply, because people hear this term a lot and it'd be helpful just to understand it broadly. And then also just like why is it so popular? Why does everyone want a product growth component to their business?

Hila Qu (00:08:15):
Just use a simple example in B2C product. When you think about Facebook, when you think about a lot of the products you use every day as an end consumer, it's always by default product led growth because there's no sales team [inaudible 00:08:32]. The LTV of the product doesn't support that. I think PLG the term become popular because traditionally in B2B, word sales is the main motion. You need a sales team to close the deal After the contract is signed, the end users can now finally use it.

(00:08:51):
But nowadays, it's not necessarily a case. You can have your B2B SaaS product developed in a way to allow end users to try before you buy. So that's the reason I think this has become being more popular. And the fundamental driver behind this is the user of B2B softwares are also human. It's the same human using B2C softwares and we're already trained to use product, try, and before we make any decision. And we demand that in B2B as well. So it needs to happen. And more and more companies are capturing that trend basically, and they're trying to utilizing that as a entry point to either disrupt existing B2B players or build something really awesome for end users. So that's why it's becoming more and more popular.

Lenny (00:09:42):
To pull on that thread a little bit more even to help people visualize a product led growth product, what makes it product led? There's a self-serve component, what are attributes or just kind of common elements of something that's product led versus sales led? Let's say.

Hila Qu (00:09:59):
Yeah, definitely. I think maybe we can use a product as a example, right? Think about Zoom how me or you, maybe everyday users, how we get to know Zoom is not necessary through a sales team call me code or email me code and introducing me this, showing a demo of Zoom, and I get to know Zoom, right? It's because maybe Lenny, you hosted a webinar I joined and I get to just use this software already without even knowing it's Zoom. And then afterwards I may one day think about I want to do this myself and I just do that in a sign-up and I already create a host a webinar and I can pay if I need a paid plan or I can use a lot of more advanced features when I, let's say hit the 40 minutes limit, I can already click that and pay and become a paid customer already.

(00:10:53):
So I think the key properties also of PLG products, think about it should have a very low barrier to entry. Usually it has a free version, free trial. You don't need get approval from your boss to use it. You can use it today and then it has some sort of a self-service checkout flow. If you need a better version, you can buy yourself as well. And this product, basically the free product will spread on its own in some way or another.

Lenny (00:11:24):
Okay, perfect. I think that was really helpful. I think we dive into some of the meat of the discussion that we have planned and where I thought it'd be fun to start is the common pitfalls that people fall into when they're trying to add a product led growth motion. And so what are the most common ways people fail when they're trying to figure out product led growth?

Hila Qu (00:11:45):
The first of all, as I mentioned, you need to have some sort of vehicle. A lot of the companies, if you go to their website, especially B2B companies, you'll see the biggest CTA is called book demo. They don't have anything else. The first step for you to do is submit a form and kind of basically explain yourself to this company, I'm from who and who company and I want to use the tool, can you come back to me and allow me to see a demo of your product? That means the entry point to PLG is cut off. Instead, the first step is you need to either have a free product, free trial, some sort of a low barrier entry for anyone who stumble upon this product to give it a try. A lot of companies don't have that. That's the first I would say hurdle or peaceful.

(00:12:38):
And especially if you are a sales lead and you already have all those things figured out, you try to go to add PLG, it's not as easy as just say, add a kind of free trial CTA on your website. You need to build this free experience. You also need to convince your sales team, your existing product team, your marketing team, "Hey, let's try this out." Because before this process is super clean. Everyone only get only selected future leads and sales work on those. But now you need to allow more people in and there need to be more understanding of their behavior data, the process need to change. So it's actually a whole process. So I would say that's first one. And along with that is some companies didn't think it thoroughly and they are just kind of saying, "Oh, PLG is cool, let's do PLG."

(00:13:34):
And then they maybe spend three months build kind of some sort of a very basic free trial and then they think that's it. They think the leads will come, conversion will come, self-service revenue will come. It's not that easy. It's not that simple. It is definitely a entire motion. So I would say you need to commit to it. Maybe you can do some thinking, collecting some data, build your conviction, but to a certain point you need to commit to at least a year or even two years kind of roadmap to build this entire thing out and change the process internally sometimes as well to support that. The last one, I would say a lot of times the company's committed, they want to do this, but they don't know the right way or they don't have the foundation, they don't have the expertise of PLG.

(00:14:27):
Their internal team, they're really good at sales or maybe really good at as the traditional motion, but they don't have this part of expertise and foundation. A common thing I see is that company want to do PLG and they have no usage data at all and they're like, "I will just doing PLG. But PLG I always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. So when you give away your free product, what you want to get in exchange are two things. One is the broader reach because free product spread itself is lower barrier to entry. Two, you want to understand the usage behavior of those free users, which features do they use and which features kind of correlates with a higher conversion rate, retention rate, all of that.

(00:15:20):
If you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing. Like you are really not being able to utilize all of that to build your PLG motion. So I think data foundation and expertise in terms of how do I design that user journey, that journey is very different from the sales user journey. Those are sometimes missing in company when they just begin to doing this. And in those cases I think it's super helpful to maybe either find someone who have done this as an advisor or hire someone like you need to have that expertise or through advisor to support your PLG motion.

Lenny (00:16:06):
This is great. We're going to talk about the data piece more in depth later, but on the commitment piece, I thought that was really interesting. I imagine many times founders or leaders think they have commitment and then they realize maybe not so much. Are there any kind of flags that tell you that, "Oh, you're not actually committed to working on this for a year or two years, whatever it takes."

Hila Qu (00:16:27):
The red flags I've seen basically sometimes, first of all, they think about PLG equals launch of free version or launch of free trial. They made this assumption in their head, "Oh, I already have a product. I already have a software that's working, customers are using. Now if I add a free version, if I open a free trial, that's it." Like that's basically PLG, and I will have conversions. I will have people becoming a product qualified leads just because I have it. "Hey, I open this for you, just come and use it and [inaudible 00:17:07]." And I think that's one red flag. Basically they are not thinking about the entire thing through understanding the implication, not only the free product, it's really just a start. You need to think about how to activate, how to design the upgrade path, how those teams, those new growth teams work with other sales and marketing teams, all of that.

(00:17:29):
So that's one. The other one is they don't have a dedicated team. They just basically assign one person to the thing. They are imagine, "Hey, you already have this. It's not that big of deal. You can just figure this out by borrowing resources from everywhere and try to coordinate all the stakeholders from sales, marketing, product." That person need to be a magician in order to be successful in that basically. And I think the third thing is basically they are really doing this because it's trendy. They didn't think about the deeper strategic reason why this is a good fit for their business. Do you have a product that's relatively low complexity, doesn't require a lot of customization for the customer to see value.

(00:18:19):
Time to value need to be relatively short or you can figure out a way to make it short. And then do you have a lot of potentially end user S&B business? They are interested in the solution. They want to try that out. If you do not have both, if you for example, develop a software for the [inaudible 00:18:42]. Companies like [inaudible 00:18:44]. Or defense companies, only three target customer exist in the entire world, you don't probably want to do PLG, right? So think deeper about the fit and then commit. And I would say those are the red flags.

Lenny (00:18:59):
Okay. So on that last point, I thought that was a really interesting, we talked about how every company probably should add a product led growth piece, but I think what you're also saying is actually not every company, there are some companies like defense contractors that are probably going to be sale led.

Hila Qu (00:19:15):
I think it's a spectrum. I would say the defense company, defense software company is a pretty extreme example. And of course in those case, I don't think it makes sense, but I think majority of B2B software, I've seen, you've seen, we've used even some more complicated ones. Like Salesforce used to be this example of sales motion. They're the pioneer of SaaS and they do this so well, but they begin to add look into sales service portal and all of that. And even a lot of the bigger players are looking into that. So I think majority of the B2B software, probably they are in the middle of the spectrum rather than the defense company.

Lenny (00:20:05):
You kind of shared some of the attributes of what allows you to be product led, like quick time to value. If you have this in your head, what are some of those bullet points of what you need to figure out for it to be successful potentially as product led?

Hila Qu (00:20:18):
The first thing is that have a... And you mentioned you are able to have a vehicle, have a free version, have a free trial. Sometimes it's a open source product. A lot of developer products start as a open source product. It has its constraints, but it is also a great kind of vehicle for PLG or if none of those are option, you can build a really realistic kind of experience. For example, I remember Amplitude, they are pursuing PLG now, but they used to have a lot of barrier. As an end user, it's hard for me to put that code into my product and see my data, but they build a really realistic interactive demo that's getting closer to PLG. So it's not PLG, but it's getting closer and you can already see the value and play with it yourself. So that's the first step. Have a vehicle.

(00:21:18):
The second step step is time to value. Basically, just because you have this vehicle doesn't mean people will come and use it and see the value. So you need to figure out how do you give your users a warm start and help them get started. I was talking with a kind of company today, they just realized we have this tool and when people come in into the free trial, they are asked to do some action, but nobody know how to do that. They may not have everything ready to take that action. So we're like, "What about we gave them some sample video or sample action they can try." Right? It's not the same as they do it themselves, but it's better. It's getting closer. And after that you can ask them to try the thing on their own and they need to do more work.

(00:22:07):
So kind of think about all the ways you can reduce time to value. It doesn't need to be this big aha moment in the first five minutes, but at least give them some mini aha moments, right? So that's the second thing, third thing is think about from there. If they get aha moment, if they want to buy, you need to have this self-checkout flow ready, self-service flow. It's the foundation, if you have it, it doesn't mean they won't buy immediately, but at least it gave them this option to do that themselves. And the fourth thing I would say, between this kind of activation usage, aha moment to this conversion moment, actually there's a big gap. And what is the gap? How you can understand the gap, how you can guide people around that journey is basically you need to have a very good grasp of data.

(00:23:03):
You need to have the foundation to understand their usage, their behavior, and then you can design a user journey in the product, in email, in all those tools to guide user to the next step. So have a very strong data foundation there. I would say. I think those are the main thing. And there are other things like your pricing need to be relatively simple. If your pricing is super complicated, they need to... Whenever they pick, for example, they try the product, they love it, they have a self-checkout flow, but in order to decide how much they need to pay, they need to send your sales some information, you need to do a quote, then that's broken, right? Or they're already confused about this process. So that is another kind of important thing as well.

Lenny (00:23:54):
Cool. So just to summarize, I took notes on this kind of the things that you got to get. If you want to add a product led growth component, there needs to be something free and kind of self-serve that you can-

Lenny (00:24:00):
... growth component. There needs to be something free and kind of self-serve that you can just start using on your own. There needs to be a quick time to value, there needs to be a self-serve checkout experience. You need a data foundation. I really love the way you phrased it where one of the benefits of product growth is the data component that'll help you understand what to build on, how to monetize these folks. And then the last piece is pricing that's simple, that people understand.

Hila Qu (00:24:23):
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just imagine you are building, selling something on e-commerce side. You need all of this, right. Just in order for the B2B buyer to buy your software in PLG motion, you need to make all those available to him. It doesn't mean if you view this, it'll happen, again, right. That's the data experimentation. A lot of that need to be there to support a lot of iteration and make this work.

Lenny (00:24:52):
Awesome. Okay, so we've been going in a lot of directions. We started with pitfalls and things you probably will... You'll run into that may set you off track. But let's zoom out again and let's get into, just say you're convinced we need to invest in adding a product-led growth motion to our product. What's the first step that you recommend for people to go down?

Hila Qu (00:25:12):
I think the first step actually, I would recommend founders and leaders to just understand what's PLG funnel, what's sales-led funnel with SLG funnel. Because I remember when I begin to work on PLG at GitLab, it was not that clear to me. There's a lot of things you can read, but they're not all super clear. What is PLG? How is that different? And through working on that myself, I begin to develop this conviction and kind of this clear picture. The biggest difference from SLG and PLG is that the sales funnel traditionally work like something... You have marketing team working on the top of funnel, bring visitor and then they need to have a process to turn the visitors into lead. And leads is something, it is basically very popular and vitally used in the B2B business. And you go through some qualification process and leads need to be from your target kind of customer, target industry.

(00:26:23):
The company need to meet certain size, but they also need to show interest. And how marketing team historically gauge interest is how much they interact with your marketing campaigns. Do they open an email? Do they read three white papers? Do they go to this webinar? That's how they gauge interest. And for each positive action you did as a buyer, they add some points to you. And once you reach certain points, you become this marketing qualified leads. Basically those are the better ones we featured through that process and we gave that to the sales team. And sales team has more process, but then they choose some of them, work on them, and they close some of them. So that's kind of traditionally B2B sales-led motion works. And then product-led funnel is different. It's much more similar to B2C. Basically you can still have people visit your website and they sign up for free version or free account or free trial.

(00:27:21):
The most important thing, the biggest difference, is now you want them to use the product. You can still send all the marketing emails, all of that, but those are supplemental. Those are kind of trying to get them to the product to use, to try, and the usage, product usage, is almost like the leading indicator for success for PLG, versus in the sales funnel, it's almost like how many do you get and do they interact with the marketing campaigns, which in the old days it's what you have because nobody can access your product unless the contract is signed. But nowadays that's almost like an artificial barrier. It's not there. You can totally build a product in a free version to allow people to use. So usage becomes so important. And that's the biggest difference from the usage that you have two potential conversion paths.

(00:28:18):
One is that if this product is not that expensive, the price point fits in most companies' budget. Some companies may just use their credit card and they buy online. That's also, you then don't even need sales team to be involved. And it's very similar to the B2C product, e-commerce product, buying process. And it's awesome because it's automated, you don't need to have more sales team involved. It's low cost, it's efficient, it can happen on its own every day. It will just add up to your revenue. And then the other potential conversion pass is where the product usage is high, but also this customer, this potential prospect, fits into your ideal customer profile. It's from a Fortune 500 company or it's from a target industry that you know they need your solution. Then this customer worth more of your time and you should actually not, even if they may want to buy on their own, you may want to still have your sales team or have your customer success team to reach out to them to understand a little bit more of the situation and give them some white glove service. Hopefully you can even close a bigger deal than if they would have buy on their own. So that's another pass. I call that PQL, PQA, like sales pass.

Lenny (00:29:47):
And that stands for product qualified lead, right?

Hila Qu (00:29:48):
Product qualified leads, product qualified account. So the first step is for you to understand those two funnels and then think about if you want to add PLG, right? What is this journey? What are the steps along that funnel you need to establish for your product in order for your user to be able to convert in that funnel?

Lenny (00:30:12):
So you talked about these two funnels. One question is, are they basically the same for almost every product or should you try to figure out what's really unique about my funnel? And then second, is there an example of product that you think about like, here's the sales led funnel for them and then here's the product-led version of that, just to make it a little more real even?

Hila Qu (00:30:30):
Maybe I can give an example first and then we can talk about the other question. So I can use GitLab as an example since that's where I'm most familiar. GitLab actually have a enterprise sales team, very strong sales team, from the very beginning. But the company also we started from open source product.

Lenny (00:30:50):
Maybe describe what GitLab is for folks that aren't super familiar with it.

Hila Qu (00:30:53):
Yeah, so GitLab, we are a developer platform, DevOps platform, basically engineer teams, developer teams. They use this product to manage their entire DevOps process, from storing their code, kind of managing the version control, releasing CSAD, like security scan, all of that. It's an all in one platform for that team. So for the sales-led motion, like I mentioned, the teams, our marketing team, were working bringing a lot of visitors to our website and they sign up for free trial, for free accounts. And then we have this lead nurturing and lead scoring process to surface which are the good ones for our sales team. In our sales team, we have SNB, we have the mid-market, we have enterprise, and they each kind of took their buckets of leads and work on them and close them. They become revenue.

(00:31:52):
And then how the product led funnel work for us is someone, maybe as a developer, I heard about GitLab, I go to website, I see, "Oh, I can actually sign up for a free account." I may use it for my personal project. My company may be using another solution, but I have some side project I'm doing as a developer. I want to use GitLab to host that. And I did that. And so you begin to see this, individual users having some usage but nothing to do with his company. And then one day maybe this person's employer, "We want to look into some other solutions. We have way too many point solutions for each step of DevOps. Now we want to potentially consolidate them. So what are the options?" And this engineer raise his hand, "Hey, I have been using GitLab for a very long time and I really like it. I think we should check them out." And then this team, maybe this engineer manager or CTO depending on the size of company, they're like, "Okay."

(00:32:55):
He went to their website and he kind of signed up for a free trial because that allow him to test some more advanced features. It's 30 days, but he already has... This person knows how to use it. This person already set up the foundation with the free version and they started the free trial. They use their 30 day to do a proof of concept, the entire company already using it for part of their process. And they're like, "Oh, awesome. I tried this feature, that feature, that feature. It's a great tool. It can support our workflow and I'm pretty sure we should be able to get ROI from this product." And then in this case they are like, "I only need five seats. It's cheap. I will just go to the pricing page and check out the pricing and buy from there." Or in some cases, this is a big company and we see this big company is using our product, our sales team get that data signal, they may send an email and reach out and say, "Hey, I saw you were checking it out. How can I help?" And that may start a sales conversation, eventually become a contract from there.

Lenny (00:34:07):
Great. Thank you for sharing that example. Maybe a last question on this first step of mapping out the funnel. Do you recommend people just get in front of a whiteboard and just sit together and like, "Here's what it would be potentially if we added a product-led growth motion?"

Hila Qu (00:34:20):
Yes. Yes. And I think it's not that... The devil is in the details. Just mapping out the big steps is not that hard. You think about, " I have a marketing site already. I can build a free version." And then they use the free version and I build a checkout flow and that's it. That's the story. But that's the first step. If you don't even have those components, mapping out the funnel will allow you to see a missing checkout flow, a missing free version, you already identified that. But the devil is in the detail one layer down. How do you design an experience for each of the step? What do you say on your marketing side to drive free signup? In the free signup, how do you guide them to use the three most important features? And in the checkout flow, which payment option do you offer so that customers from everywhere can buy very smoothly? So that's the next layers kind of detail that actually has so many opportunities for optimization, maximization and all of that.

Lenny (00:35:29):
That's actually a really good segue to the next question, which is just, okay, you've mapped out the funnel, what do you do next?

Hila Qu (00:35:35):
If you don't have the foundational components, you need to build all of that. But if you have something, if you already have this funnel exist, right, it's just not working perfectly at least, but it's working, it's there. I think the next step is you need to pick a starting point. Where do you want to focus first to drive the maximum impact? Personally, I'm a big fan of finding leverage. I think doing growth is always about finding leverage. If you can always find the area that with relatively small investment can give you the biggest results, that can be such a kind of momentum, can empower you through future experiments and more work. And just finding leverage is a beautiful thing in my mind. So I always want to do that. So when I think about pick a starting point, one thing I actually do with a lot of my advisory clients as a first step is, we do a full funnel audit, full PLG funnel audit.

(00:36:38):
Think about, we go through me as a kind of end user, go through the entire journey, pretend I am interested, semi interested, and I want to buy from the website. Does that kind of attract me? Is it super clear the value proposition? And then from there, going through the sign up of the free account or free trial, is that smooth? And when I begin to use the product, do I get to my aha moment fast or I am very confused and frustrated, abandoned at that moment? And from there, if I'm like, think this is good, right, I hit my aha moment, I want to buy. Can I even buy? You will never believe, like when I do this audit,, there are so many low hanging fruits usually in this process. For example, one client, when I go to the checkout flow, the kind of checkout form is so confusing.

(00:37:38):
They ask a bunch of questions that only let's say UK customer need. Every other places they don't need to answer, but they ask the question anyway. And I as a US based person is very confused and I drop off at that point. And then there are other things, for example, the aha moments like I talk about. I don't know what to do when I land inside a product for the first time, I'm super excited and ready, but I don't know what to do. I'm so lost and confused. That's usually a pretty big focus area and opportunity area. Just getting your users to aha moments. They are already over so many hurdles here, but don't just turn down them and they leave because it's so confusing.

Lenny (00:38:25):
It might be helpful just to explain an aha moment. I know people hear this term a lot. What's a simple way to think about what is an aha moment?

Hila Qu (00:38:32):
I think it as a moment, as a first time a user experienced value of your product. So it gets popular because Facebook has this example from the early growth days. I think you added 10 friends in seven days, you hit your aha moment. But there are many layers under that. The reason why Facebook used that to define its aha moment is because in early days, if you add these friends, you begin to form some connection. You can see an interesting feed, you can interact with your friends, and that social interaction, it's the core value of Facebook, and Facebook leaves by looking at a lot of data. If you meet that data metric criteria it's kind of very likely you will hit that aha moment. But I think for a lot of, especially we're talking about many SaaS product, B2B software, the value of such product is usually either you see a workflow can be supported by this, it can save your time, it can save your money, it can help you make more money, or it just solve this pain point that you never get to solve on your own without a software product.

(00:39:57):
So at GitLab we actually did a bunch of analysis. We're trying to understand what is the aha moment for our new users. We ended up have something along the line of two users, two features used in the first 14 days. So it's very similar to Facebook's kind of format. But deep down, because we are a platform, we are a team product, two users is talking about the team components. Whatever the first user is trying and using that is so valuable, he or she is confident to invite another coworker to come in. That itself is very, very valuable action and indicates this first user is seeing value. And if together they use two or more features, that means we are seeing the collaboration, the platform components of the product. And within the first 14 days, because it has to be reasonably quick but not unrealistic, because we are a complicated product, we're not Facebook, we're not Zynga or a game app, it's hard for you to figure it out in the first day. So yeah, I think it's a very important concept for any PLG company to figure out because that's often the biggest opportunity area I see.

Lenny (00:41:24):
Aha moment and activation is often interchangeable, right?

Hila Qu (00:41:27):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:41:27):
So those are kind of two things you'll hear. And just to reframe, re-say what you say, so GitLab's activation slash aha moment milestone was two users using two features in 14 days.

Hila Qu (00:41:38):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:41:40):
And I imagine the way you got to that was you looked at what point does retention improve if they got to a certain milestone, right? Is that roughly how you [inaudible 00:41:48]?

Hila Qu (00:41:47):
Yeah, exactly. So there are how you can get to that, right? First of all, the internal team, our growth team, actually we did some brainstorming. We think about what are the potential action or behavior that indicate they're getting value. We ideally want to do something like they maybe successfully merge their first PR or they successfully run their first pipeline. All of that. There are some potential high value actions we can think of. We just list all of them. And then the next step is, we did a correlation analysis to understand, hey, those are the 10 high value actions we believe we want to look at. If a new user did this action, what's the maybe 30 day conversion rate and... Not 30 day, 90 day conversion rate. What's the 30 day retention rate? Because we look at both. Sometimes you only look at retention or you only look at conversion, it doesn't give you the full picture.

(00:42:52):
So we look at if you did this action, let's say if, Lenny, you are trying our product, you are able to successfully merge the PR in your first 30 days. Does that improve your likelihood to convert? Does that improve your likelihood to retain? And we compare across those 10 high value actions, compare with the average. And we begin to see, oh, some actions actually if you do that, it lift your conversion, lift your retention much bigger. And those are the candidates for potential aha moments. And from there, the reason why we ended up not picking one single action... For some products, actually you can pick a single action. If one action really stands out, I don't know, for Airbnb [inaudible 00:43:39] is probably, you book a hotel, you go to there, you are so happy, you leave a high star review. That's the key action for this platform.

(00:43:49):
For GitLab, we have so many different workflow components. Teams are here for different reasons. Some are here for security, some are here for like CSAD. So that's why we ended up combining like two action. It can be any of the two high value features. The next step is actually you need to launch some experiments to try to get more people to do those high value action. And you then see, do I see higher conversion? Do I see higher retention? Because in data you are only isolating correlation. You are not proving causation. You just saw people who are doing this are more likely to convert. But it doesn't mean if you get people to do that, they will convert. So experimentation is the step. You will finally kind of validate that.

Lenny (00:44:37):
Hila, this is amazing. This is like a mini podcast on activation. We should do another one just on this. And then in the show notes, I'll link to a couple posts that I've written with a bunch of advice on setting activation milestones and improving them. I forget if you've contributed to that post or not, but if not, we should add some of these stories. But let's get back to our core. We have enough to talk about on just product led growth. So just to summarize the audit that you do, I wrote some notes as you were talking, and maybe we can keep going from that point. What you look for when you're auditing a product to see where they may pick a starting point, what I wrote down is, one, are you just excited to try it? Is the landing page pulling you in? Two, can you actually use it on your own and just try it? Three, do you get to the aha moment where you're like, okay, I get it, [inaudible 00:45:25] it, and then can I actually buy this on my own? Is that roughly the audit? Is there anything more to that?

Hila Qu (00:45:30):
Exactly. And I also look at their initial first few emails they send to me, because sometimes the email magically can help a lot. If I'm frustrated the first time... The other day I'm trying a product, I'm frustrated, I'm like, I will give up. And then in the night I saw an email, I'm like, oh, maybe I just click the CTA and give it one more try. And that time actually I figured out I get to the aha moment.

(00:45:57):
So I also look at the email, the first initial emails, and then when I map this out, I ask the company to give me the data at very high level for each of the step. How many people are on your website? How many people go through signup? How many people hit this aha moment? We need to define that. We need to... Usually a lot of discussion, like how many people get to the aha moment, how many people started self-checkout and being successful. And then like that between my experience from a user perspective and the data, we usually immediately begin to see, oh, this is the biggest opportunity. Usually activation and conversion are two of the common starting places.

(00:47:31):
Okay, so let's get into that then. So you've done this audit, what other advice do you have for folks to figure out where they should start and invest in that part of the product to help launch product-led growth?

Hila Qu (00:47:42):
You can do a audit like this yourself, right. Just imagine if you are a B2C user trying to buy a product, you want it to be easy. Ideally, PLG for B2B can be that easy as well. So go through that process and identify, where is confusing, where do you get stuck? If you find-

Hila Qu (00:48:00):
... where is confusing. Where do you get stuck if you find that you have a problem with activation, meaning if you enter into the product you are like what do I do, I don't know what should I do, and maybe I just left. And then, if that's the biggest opportunity, activation, then you need to think about find the right aha moment metric as the first step, as we just talked about, because that's the success, that's the goalpost. And then, design a product experience to help more people together. And I usually think about do is better than show is better than tell, meaning you want to remove all the frictions and somehow give them a warm start, give them some sample template, give them some sample thing they can play with initially in that very moment already, and you can supplement that with your email to bring them to the product if they don't do that. So that's activation. If activation is okay, but your conversion, your self-check checkout flow, usually there are also room for improvement. Many company I work with, when I try to buy, I cannot even find where to buy. It's very hard to find where do I click to start this checkout process, or they may have some frictions in the checkout flow where it's not localized. One company, when I look at their data, they find that India has very low success rate, which is expected, but we begin to say it's because the payment solution they choose actually doesn't support that market well. And they added another payment solution, immediately they are seeing much better success rate. And if they're already in the checkout, you don't want to lose any of them, right? Just do a hundred experiments to get to as much higher kind of commercial possible, because you don't want to lose any of them. So activation, conversion, usually are two great place to start.

(00:50:08):
And then from there, I would say think about your PQL/PQA, motion, which is the other conversion pass, which is if you also want to have sales blended into this, right, product-led sales motion, how do you set up the structure, the foundation so that you can know what are some data signal to tell you those are better leads? And what are some customer criteria, in terms of size segment, you should set up, how do you get those data, and then how do you hand this to your sales team, how they can close using those data, use this knowledge? That's another very big opportunity area. That's a bigger effort, compared to those two low-hanging fruits.

(00:50:53):
And the last thing I would say, product-led acquisition is a great place to start. If your product is a collaboration software, think about Airtable and it's Figma, right? As part of my workflow, I invite my team to join, I spread this out. If you have that use case, you can build that into a product that's awesome, that's very powerful.

Lenny (00:51:18):
So there's a lot there. So let me try to summarize what you just shared and how it connects. So you have a self-serve product, you've gotten to a point where you can sign up and try something for free?

Hila Qu (00:51:28):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:51:29):
And then you do this audit of where along this journey do we think the biggest opportunities lie and the most leverage lives? And you have these, I think, four buckets of opportunity?

Hila Qu (00:51:40):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:51:40):
Acquisition, which is top of funnel, do you want to double down and invest there first, or activation, which is help people see the value more quickly?

Hila Qu (00:51:48):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:51:49):
Bucket three would be, you called it conversion, which essentially help them buy it more efficiently?

Hila Qu (00:51:56):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:51:56):
And then there's a bucket of retention, of just keeping them around longer, which I don't know if you mentioned this, but I know that's probably not where you want to start, so it's even not worth chatting about too much.

Hila Qu (00:52:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:05):
Cool. And so the question, basically, a founder or product team has to decide is which of these three buckets do they go in on when they're trying to add product growth, acquisition, activation or conversion?

Hila Qu (00:52:16):
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:52:17):
It'd be cool, maybe just one example of each of these three buckets, like what's a product that did a good job here? And then you also talked about how to know which one to start with. Maybe just again, just a quick summary of you should probably start activation if this, if you have something like that?

Hila Qu (00:52:32):
You should probably start with activation. Activation is actually a common good starting place for most B2B software.

Lenny (00:52:32):
Awesome.

Hila Qu (00:52:40):
Because usually B2B softwares are not designed to really get you to use quickly, historically. A good example, there are, I think, all the best PLG companies, they do a awesome job. That's almost like my criteria to say whether this is a great PLG product or not. Think about Miro, as an example. If you go through their activation experience and sign up to usage, they ask very limited questions, very targeted. They drop you, kind of, they ask you about your use case, what are you here for? Are here to do a brainstorm session? Are you here to develop a roadmap? And they quickly gave you templates to get started. Just like in maybe five minutes, you finish the entire journey from go to the website and sign up, answer a few questions, and you are already using the template they provided to do the thing you want to do. That's time to value. That's a success. I think that's a really great standard for all the PLG, like a B2B product, try to follow. So that's activation is usually a good place. If you don't know where to start, do that.

(00:53:54):
And then conversion, I would say, is a place, again, worth investing, but there are two layers. One is the self-check-hub flow, just do some experiments there. You can actually go to any E-commerce website, like, I don't know, go to Lululemon, go to Amazon, make your conversion process as easy as theirs. That should be your goal. The consumers shouldn't be confused about complicated pricing, where to find all of that, so that's a place always worth investing, testing more, because that's revenue so close to be added into your book.

(00:54:39):
And then the PQL/PQA part, the other more-complicated path, I would say that's something you want to figure out activation and self-checkout a little bit, and you want to have some reasonable user number and then invest there, otherwise it can be a little bit jumping too fast and jumping too ahead. And the acquisition, a product-led acquisition is a great place to invest, if you have a collaboration workflow, you have some inherent, internal viral components in your products. Think about Figma, think about Calendarly even, right? It can spread. This product is so easy. You can build something to allow it to spread on its own.

Lenny (00:55:24):
Okay. I'm hoping that was really helpful, because I think a lot of people are like where do I start, what do I do to help start moving down this road of product growth? And what I'm hearing generally is just activation is probably where you want to focus, which is essentially getting people to your value quicker. And what's cool about that, and we had a podcast with Lauryn Isford from formerly Airtable, now at Notion, talking about all the ways to do that. And interestingly, one of the biggest levers for retention, and moving retention, is often onboarding and improving activation, so win-win.

Hila Qu (00:56:00):
Yeah, definitely. And I could talk a little bit about retention expansion, if you think that's helpful as well?

Lenny (00:56:00):
Sure, let's do that here.

Hila Qu (00:56:08):
Yeah, I know that I didn't talk about that in the post, and there are people asking, hey, do you plan to write another post on this specific topic? So the reason why I didn't cover too much retention expansion is, as you mentioned, it's not usually a first place to start. I call retention the messy middle. It's actually a messy part of the entire funnel. A quick activation, conversion, those are fast. Those are almost sometimes shorter time span, right? You have a lot of never, and you can test very quickly, and that acquisition is a very big leverage. You need to get more users, always.

(00:56:48):
Retention is super important, but it's a little bit messy. It's over a very long period of time, and your customers can be, at any given moment, they can be retained or not, like if they just cancel or they just decided not to use anymore, you already lost them, so it's a very messy part. But how I think about retention, there are two steps. One is how to build a habit in their usage pattern, so that they are using this maybe every week, every day. The key to do that is, first of all, your product need to have a high enough frequency. If you are using this once per month, it's not likely you can build this into a habit.

(00:57:39):
Before GitLab, I worked at Acorns. We started as an investment app, and the whole thing is passive investment, passive investing. You bought some ETFs, and then you basically don't even need to check, and you just keep adding money and it will grow, and after 10 years is awesome. It's actually the right investment philosophy, but when I worked as a head of growth, it made a big challenge for me, because think about set and forget it. They don't even need to go back to a product to be successful. And that make it very hard, as a head of growth, to drive engagement, drive retention. I don't even know whether they're retained or not, if they are not coming back, right? I can only gauge from other indicators. So I think one thing I would say about building habit is think about how to build those habit feature or collaboration feature into your workflow already, into the product already. That is the reason they can retain, fundamentally, if it's high frequency, if it involves collaboration with other people, if it's part of their workflow. So that's the first step. You can obviously use a lot of the looks to reinforce that. You can send them an email if they take certain action, and get them back, and to repeat that action, but fundamentally you need to build that into your product.

(00:59:09):
And then the next part around retention is I actually think extension is part of retention. Basically you already have a steady usage flow. You are using this habitually every week, every day. What are the right moment to prompt you to think about maybe buying more? And there are three buckets of product-led extension. The first one is up upgrade to a higher tier. The second one is buying more seeds, buying more license. The third one is if you have some sort of a consumption add-on component, just consuming more, right? Like for GitLab, you can go from bronze tier to a silver tier, you can go to a higher tier, and then you can buy more seeds, and you can also buy more CSCD minutes to consume. Those are all the different moments. How you can do that is really understand data, understand usage, and trigger a lot of the right conversation at the right moment to the right person.

(01:00:17):
And you can, again, a lot of similar tactics you use in activation conversion actually can be beautifully applied in expansion, because it's almost a combination of getting people to the aha of that feature, use that feature, try that feature, getting them to convert.

Lenny (01:00:34):
You're leaving all these gold bricks that I have to resist not following and getting off track with, because there's so much, and like retention is its own conversation. We could have maybe just one question along those lines. What's something that you've launched that had a tremendous impact on retention? Is there an example of just like, wow, that really had a big impact, you talk about frequency maybe, but what comes to mind?

Hila Qu (01:00:56):
I can share some of my example at a course my-

Lenny (01:00:59):
Yeah.

Hila Qu (01:01:00):
I think there are two things. One thing is actually very similar to what you just said. When I was asked to work on retention, I did a bunch of analysis. The biggest leverage for me is actually activation. So I ended up doing tons of experiments in activation. I identified what are the features for users to take experience value quickly so that they are more likely to retain. For us, it's a feature called recurring investment, which makes sense in hindsight, but at that time nobody's caring about that. We have some other very cool investment features called roundup investment, so nobody is really paying a lot of a attention on this, but when I look at data, I saw recurring investment has a high correlation with retention. So I did a lot of work trying to get more people to set this up, and which has been a great success, actually, in a very short period of time.

(01:01:58):
And then from there, I would say we begin to add more use cases that has a higher frequency, like I mentioned, right? If you only come here once per month to check our investment, it's very hard to retain you. We don't have any lever to engagement with you as well, if you are not in the product. So we ended up adding IRA account, retirement account. We ended up adding spending account, like a debit card, like more high-frequency use cases. Those use cases come with higher frequency and better retention by nature, so now you change the problem from how do I improve retention to how do I drive adoption of higher-frequency use cases? So I did, again, a bunch of experiments how to drive more adoption of retirement account. Once you have a retirement account, an IRA, there's tax consequences, all of that. There it's very hard for you to leave. So you flip the question into, again, adoption/activation problem in that case as well.

Lenny (01:03:04):
Amazing. Thank you for sharing those. Oh man, there's so many other things we could talk about retention, but we have enough to talk about on product-led growth. So there's two other areas that I want to touch on. One is data and infrastructure, and what people should know about how to set that up for success, and the other is hiring your team, and how to build out your product-led growth team. So starting with the data piece, maybe just as a big picture, just like what are the buckets of data and infrastructure people should be thinking about that they're going to have to invest in or should start thinking about early?

Hila Qu (01:03:36):
I think there are two big buckets. The first bucket is product usage data. As I mentioned, a lot of B2B software, they're really lacking in that, because when you sell via sales team, you don't need to know so many details, so granular usage data, all of that. The second bucket is I call this customer 360 database, because product usage data is one component, is the most essential. In order for your product-led gross motion to be successful, you also need to connect that with your marketing teams, marketing campaigns, your CRM, your sales force, who are the customers, prospects, what their stage. So those ideally need to be connected so that you have a 360 picture of your customer. If I have an Airbnb as a potential, like a target account, do I know there are users from Airbnb that are using my product, which features are they using, and do I send any marketing campaigns to each of them, do they respond, all of that. All of those ideally need to be connected, but in reality is all over the place. It's all in its own tools in most of the B2B companies.

Lenny (01:04:57):
What are just some tools that you think people should check out, start with maybe? What's Hila's recommendations on an initial stack or areas to explore, in terms of tooling?

Hila Qu (01:05:08):
I say there are two piece. One is infra, the other piece are some tools that are kind of secondary. So from infrastructure perspective, on data tool, my first tool usually, one is some sort of data hub segment, right? This next one is some sort of a product analytics tool. Think about Amplitude. I know PostHog is actually a pretty popular one. It's an open-source product analytics tool. There are Mixpanel, Pandle, all of that. So have some sort of data hub, data collection tool, and have some sort of product analytics tool. That's the data infrastructure.

(01:05:49):
And then you need to have an experimentation tool because, like I said, you cannot just imagine you build everything and everything works perfectly. So you need either like Optimizely, I know Amplitude has some experimentation components. Eppo is a new and upcoming one. You need some tool to allow you to do experimentation.

(01:06:12):
The third piece I think that's pretty essential, I counted in the infra, is some sort of a lifecycle marketing tool. I know many B2B companies, they use HubSpot or they use something for their email marketing, but those are usually least nurturing. And it's very different from lifecycle marketing tool, meaning you need to connect with Segment, Amplitude. You know what customers are doing your product, your design, your email, your in-app, your push notification, based on their behavior, at the right moment, to the right person. And you measure success by do they take the right action in a product, versus the lead nurture email marketing tool is do I get them to read the article, open the email, I add 10 points to their lead score, and they are a next step further in their list funnel? So, data tool, experimentation tool, lifecycle marketing tool, those are the infra.

(01:07:10):
And then from there, there are a lot of PLD tools you can add on top to make your day-to-day much easier. Just to start, as so like that are most essential for acquisition, you need to have some sort of a like a data enrichment tool. Think about ZoomInfo, Clearbit, because the biggest difference between B2B and B2C is that you still need to know about their company. You want to know this person, but you also want to know this person's company, right? That's a very important thing, and you can get a lot out of those data enrichment tool, and then you can design your journey differently based on that.

(01:07:52):
For activation, a lot of my clients are finding a lot of value in those tools like Appcues, User-Led, basically the tools that allow you to build onboarding flow quickly in a product without engineer kind of resource. So you need to do some initial integration, but as soon as you did that a marketing manager, a PM or someone, can just build some customized onboarding step-by-step flows himself. I think that's quite neat, because you need to test the tongue in that area.

(01:08:27):
And in terms of conversion, I would say there are many product-led growth, product-led sales tools. I think those are great. If you want to build out your PQL/PQA conversion pass, think about Endgame, Pocus, Tableau and Pace. There are a couple of them.

Lenny (01:08:47):
Wow. Amazing. That was an awesome list and really well-structured. Is there anything else along the data or infrastructure piece that you want to touch on before we move on to hiring and the team?

Hila Qu (01:08:59):
I just want to go back to the point, as I mentioned, product-led growth is data-led growth deep down. So in most of the situation when I see a company want to get started, where they are really missing or they need to invest more, is data. So if you identify you have a gap in this area, don't feel bad as well. A lot of pretty big companies are in the same shoes, and if you can't invest the time, money, the team, the tool, to figure this out, the benefit of this, right, the data collection, understanding usage data, can not only power your PLG motion, it can really power your entire product team, even your customer success team. Now you gave them the ingredients they need to develop the next feature, based on not only what your top customer asked for, but also what everybody's using, right?

(01:09:59):
Your customer success team can take a much deeper view in understanding what the clients are using, rather than just talk with the executives from the client and get a rough gauge of the situation. So I think it is a area worth investing, and every B2B company should be investing in.

Lenny (01:10:21):
I'm trying to channel what listeners might be thinking right now, and I imagine some people might be like what if I pick the wrong tool? I'm kind of stressed, I have to do all this research. I'm kind of worried about starting, because it'll set me up for failure later. Which of these buckets do you think is most important to get right, right from the beginning, and any advice on how to just avoid messing that up?

Hila Qu (01:10:41):
To get started, I would say probably a product analytics tool is the first step, and maybe the data hub, such as Segment. So if you have Segment and particle tools like that, it allows you to plug into so many different tools. You can basically try all the different tools, and if it doesn't work, you just flip a switch, you can try another tool. So there is a benefit there, but it is expensive, so I know companies may just go right into the product analytics tool. I would say it's hard to get it wrong completely, right?

(01:11:19):
In order for a product analytics tool to be meaningful, the first step is you need to collect the data, you need to do some instrumentation, you need to have the foundation. And then, because it's garbage in, garbage out, if you send a bunch of garbage data into your product analytics tool, your analyst will be just even more confusing, right? It's like he doesn't know whether to trust the data, what to use. So a lot of company I work with, the first step is maybe not looking into tool, but do an audit of your data instrumentation situation, to understand how many of the key actions are intact, is the format correct, is the data, what are the gaps? And you may need to do some re-instrumenta ...

Hila Qu (01:12:00):
Right, what are the gaps? And you may need to do some reinstrumentation, reformatting and things like that before you even plug into a product analytics to make it useful.

Lenny (01:12:10):
For someone that may want to do that audit, is there a thing you would point them to, or, I don't know, a blog, a course, something to help them understand if they're doing it right? Or is it like, "Bring Hila on," and you need someone like you to kind of help them through it?

Hila Qu (01:12:24):
No, you can bring me, but you don't have to bring me. I think there are, if you search on Google just the data dictionary, or data product usage, data audit, a lot of companies published template and spreadsheet you can use. I can even send you a few afterwards.

Lenny (01:12:43):
That'd be amazing.

Hila Qu (01:12:44):
And then you can just scroll through. Basically the key idea is go through your product experience, identify the key actions, and go through your data instrumentation and see, "Do they match?"

(01:12:57):
And the success of this is you identify the gaps and eventually you want to establish something called the data dictionary. I basically do that for a lot of my clients. And the data dictionary will include, here are all the key actions, what's the event name for each of those, and what are the property and things like that.

(01:13:17):
But you now know, "Hey, I have this action track, this is the name. If I have a new product manager or analyst, we can all refer to this." And everyone know the same definition rather than people are interpreting differently. So that's a very important part to success even before the tooling.

Lenny (01:13:39):
Awesome. It also reminds me a previous guest, Crystal Widjaja, has a awesome post on why most analytics efforts fail. And she talks a lot about this, of how to set your events up for success. So we'll link to that as well.

Hila Qu (01:13:50):
Mm-hm.

Lenny (01:13:51):
Maybe one last thing here, I'm trying to think about what would screw people up most, and it's probably not having a data warehouse and ETL sorts of tooling in place, because that feeds a lot of this.

Hila Qu (01:13:51):
Yep.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Is there anything you want to add there about just the importance of a data warehouse and how to set that up?

Hila Qu (01:14:06):
Some of the early stage companies I work with, when they just get started in the very beginning, they don't have data warehouse. They just basically have their product and they have some sort of a Google Analytics or Amplitude, and that's it. It's pretty wild, but it's working and they can get to someplace from there.

(01:14:25):
But as soon as you begin to have data user, it's time to get serious to establish a data warehouse, have some ETL solution. I think there are the most common best practice ones, like AWS and things like that. There are also some startups that are doing this and you can utilize as well.

(01:14:49):
But again, as soon as you become a serious business, you should invest in that. Otherwise, it's pretty wild and it's pretty fragile as well.

Lenny (01:14:59):
And when you say AWS, you mean at Redshift, I imagine?

Hila Qu (01:15:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:02):
Cool. Awesome. Okay, final area that we have time for, which is awesome, which is around building your team. So maybe just two questions here. What is your advice for starting the initial team investing in PLG? How does that usually look and what do you think people should do? And then later, how does that evolve over time?

Hila Qu (01:15:21):
How I see most companies started is the founder or the leadership team realize that they need to do PLG. And they build a conviction. Maybe initially there isn't even a dedicated team, but they did something here and there, they decided to invest in this.

(01:15:40):
And the common place to start is to hire a head of growth, or it can be a lead growth PM, but someone who has a little bit of experience in this area. And then they begin to build this core growth squad as the first growth team. And I think that's a very common place to start.

(01:16:01):
The other place to start that's less common, but I also think it happening in reality, is maybe they will start a cross-functional, almost like a tiger team. Because if the initial focus area is, let's say, they want to do a product qualified lead, or basically add that funnel. That involves not only product team, that will involve data team because you want to know what are the usage pattern that indicate these is better leads. You also need to bring sales team in because they need to work on those leads to close them.

(01:16:39):
So if that's the initial starting area, a cross-functional tiger team is also possible option. But the most common way is hire a head of growth, usually a growth PM, and then start a team with engineering, design, data to support that core growth squad.

Lenny (01:17:00):
And the main difference between these two. One is dedicated, "We are going to dedicate full-time people to helping us grow." Like I say we talked about earlier, let's say they're going to focus on activation and that's their whole job. Versus tiger team is basically they're borrowing resources from other teams and this is kind of a side project for them.

Hila Qu (01:17:18):
Yeah. A little bit, for a period of time. So it's temporary. It's kind of they almost to want to get into... I would say usually the cross-functional team, the tiger team, is a little bit prior to a full commitment. They're pretty much committed, but they still want to try this out and get a final conviction, and then they begin to dedicate resources.

(01:17:43):
And you ask about how do they evolve from there.

Lenny (01:17:46):
Before we actually get there, maybe one more quick question. Which would you recommend? I imagine you'd recommend a dedicated team, if you can do that.

Hila Qu (01:17:54):
Mm-hm.

Lenny (01:17:55):
When would it make sense to go the tiger team route? In what cases?

Hila Qu (01:17:59):
One situation I would recommend is that if the initial focus area is, like I said, product qualified leads, the sales conversion path. Because if you think about you have a head of growth or a core growth PM, that person usually has a growth PM background and is in the product organization. And they're awesome if the initial focus areas are activation, conversion, those kind of involve a lot of experimentation. But activation and conversion are relatively confined, it's something the growth PM and engineer design data, they can work on.

(01:18:39):
If your initial focus area you felt like, "My biggest bit is actually do this PQL thing," it is a little bit harder for the growth PM to socialize all those cross-functional resources, because he need to get pretty deep into data. He need to have a counterpart in sales, even in marketing. So in that case, I think it's possible that maybe you start a tiger team.

(01:19:03):
You can combine both. You can have a growth PM dedicated, but have some tiger team to be working with him or her on this PQL project as well.

Lenny (01:19:14):
Got it. And I like this term tiger team, by the way. I haven't heard that before. It sounds like a lot of fun. Very dynamic. Okay, cool. And then yeah, what happens next after you have this initial team?

Hila Qu (01:19:24):
Once you have this initial team, it's important to give them the resources they need, and give them an initial focus area, give them support and a little bit time, allow them to try things out and get some early wins. And early win is the biggest thing I would say for, and whenever you start a new growth team, try to look for some opportunity, try to get some early wins in whichever focus area you choose.

(01:19:53):
And from there, if you get some of the wins, the team has some momentum, there are more confidence from the organization in PLG, right? It's time to potentially extend and formalize. So fundamentally I think you should not only think about the PLG team, you should think about the PLG org. Because PLG is a motion, it's cross-functional by nature, it's not just a product team or growth team.

(01:20:24):
Eventually you need to get to the place basically there is a head of growth product, that's the center of the PLG org. But there's also need to be a head of growth marketing, that's his or her counterpart in marketing organization. And then a head of product led sales, that's the counterpart in the sales organization.

(01:20:47):
Exactly where they sit, how they sit, it's different company by company. The most common one is head of growth product report to product org, head of growth marketing report to marketing, head of product led sales report to sales. But they have some sort of a very strong collaboration, because they are working in the same motion and same funnel. But I think that's next step, think about this org.

(01:21:11):
Once you have those counterparts in product, in sales, in marketing, the next step is think about what are the metrics they own to make sure you can manage this funnel, this motion, in the data-driven way. Because the PLG metrics are very different from SLG. The top of funnel is more about high quality signups. You don't want a lot of traffic, you want free signup, free trials. But it need to meet certain quality bar, it's not just anyone.

(01:21:46):
And then the head of growth product, he or her top KPI is about usage, activation. Activated teams is a very common metric. And then maybe number of PQLs, that's another. You want to get those teams to certain usage threshold basically.

(01:22:07):
And then the head of product led sales, he will be focused on converting those PQLs into revenue. So he will focus a lot on conversion rate, efficiency and maybe revenue, things like that.

Lenny (01:22:23):
Got it. And you're sharing a lot of org design verbally in the post, which we'll share obviously in the show notes. You can actually see a diagram of what these look like, to help kind of make it super clear.

(01:22:36):
I have maybe just one more question. Going back to the initial team, what are the functions you recommend they have on this like MVP PLG team?

Hila Qu (01:22:45):
The most important one is have a growth PM to be the lead, right? Head of growth, director of growth, lead growth PM. And then the growth PM, as you know probably very well, growth PM, he is a PM but has a much stronger skill set in analytics, experimentation, very data-driven. Think about metrics.

(01:23:06):
The growth PM's way of working is similar to other product manager, but his KPIs is actually more similar to the sales and marketing work. He's very focused on the conversion rate, the journey, the funnel versus the feature specifically itself.

(01:23:23):
And then the other functions you need to have for sure, I would often say actually a data analyst needs to be the very first hire. Sometimes even try to find a growth PM who can do analysis if you're really small, you can find that type of unicorn person.

(01:23:43):
Or even before hiring growth PM, hiring analyst, I would actually go as far as that. Because without insight, without a lot of foundation, your experimentation, your effort is really directionless in a sense.

(01:23:58):
So growth PM, analyst. And from there definitely you need some dedicated engineer, you need a designer. Designer can be somewhat not dedicated in early days, but engineer needs to be. Some sort of user research support as well, it doesn't need to be dedicated. But those are the core growth squad.

Lenny (01:24:18):
Okay. Real actual last question here for the growth PM. In your experience, are they most often coming from within the company already and they kind of shift to this role? Or do you recommend they find someone externally?

Hila Qu (01:24:30):
That's an excellent question. I have seen both. I actually recommend if you can find someone internally, maybe he's a PM, he want to do growth. Or he is an analyst who want to become more like a product role.

(01:24:48):
I even have a one client, the head of growth I work with used to be a investor relationship, like head of investor relationship. And he reports to the CEO and founder. He's very analytical. He hasn't been a PM before, but he can socialize the resource within the company to launch experiments in product, in marketing, in all of that. And I, as an advisor, will come in, guide him in the area he's not familiar with. And we actually drive pretty good results together.

(01:25:20):
So I think prefer hiring internally if possible. If not, if you really don't have anyone internally with that knowledge or with that interest, you can look outside. I would say map the initial growth PM hire to your starting point. If we already decided activation is the biggest focus area, try to find some growth PM with that experience. And if the conversion is a focus area, acquisition is the focus area, try to find someone with that experience.

Lenny (01:25:54):
I love that advice. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got actually seven questions for you, the most ever we've had for a lightning round. Are you ready?

Hila Qu (01:26:04):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Okay. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Hila Qu (01:26:10):
This first one is called The Almanack Of Naval. Yeah, I don't know whether we read that one. I really love that one. That's kind of a life-changing book for me. I have it-

Lenny (01:26:22):
Do you have a favorite Naval-ism that comes to mind?

Hila Qu (01:26:26):
I learned finding leverage from him. He talked about there are four type of leverage. It can be your writing, it can be code, it can be capital, it can be team. So the reason why I invest a lot in writing is I felt like that's my leverage. And I love that.

(01:26:44):
The second book is called How Women Rise. I really love this one. I gifted this to a lot of my female team member and I really learned a lot from them.

(01:26:56):
And the third one is my book, it's called [Chinese 01:27:01]. It's only in Chinese, if you don't read Chinese you cannot read it. But I heard, my friends told me, if you are launching an email campaign, if you're doing experiments, have this book by the side, it will help with conversion rate just by its appearance.

Lenny (01:27:18):
That's amazing. Is there an English translation or is it only in Chinese right now?

Hila Qu (01:27:22):
It's only in Chinese, so you have to learn.

Lenny (01:27:25):
All right, I see. All right. There's an advantage there, if you can speak Chinese your email conversion will go up.

Hila Qu (01:27:29):
Yes.

Lenny (01:27:30):
And then just to the first book, it was called The Almanack Of Naval, right?

Hila Qu (01:27:34):
Okay.

Lenny (01:27:35):
Is that right?

Hila Qu (01:27:35):
Yes, yes.

Lenny (01:27:36):
Okay, cool. Sweet. And we'll link to all these. Okay, favorite recent movie or TV show?

Hila Qu (01:27:41):
I watched a movie, it's a sci-fi movie from China, it's called The Wandering Earth 2. It's by the famous author, Cixin Liu. He's the author of Three Bodies. I don't know whether you heard of it?

Lenny (01:27:53):
Mm-hm. Oh my God, love that.

Hila Qu (01:27:54):
That movie is awesome. It's kind of really cool. I really highly recommend it.

Lenny (01:28:00):
I have to go check that out. Oh my God. I heard they're bringing Three Body Problem to Apple TV or Netflix. There's like a show coming.

Hila Qu (01:28:06):
Yes, yes. I look forward to that as well. I watched many versions already kind of film, none of them are good. So-

Lenny (01:28:17):
That's the problem it's so hard to do well. Oh man, I'm not optimistic, but I'm excited anyway.

Hila Qu (01:28:21):
Yeah, yeah.

Lenny (01:28:22):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask.

Hila Qu (01:28:24):
When I interview a growth PM or analyst, I will always ask, "What is a experiment you launched that has a very unexpected result? And what did you do after that?"

Lenny (01:28:37):
What do you look for in an answer there that makes you feel like they are strong?

Hila Qu (01:28:41):
So first of all, they have to be launching a lot of experiments to get very unexpected answer. So if you are only... Many people remember their success for the interview, they prepare that very well. I don't want to ask, "What's your successful experiment?"

(01:28:58):
Secondly, I want to know just why it's unexpected. That reveals the deep, deep level of their thinking, how deep they are thinking. If they should expect that based on what they described, then they are not thinking deep enough, they are not understanding customer enough.

(01:29:15):
And what they do afterwards is also awesome. Like, "How do you face a failure or unexpected result? What are the clues you can pursue? What are the actions you can take? How do you learn something out of it?"

Lenny (01:29:28):
I love it. What's a favorite recent product you've recently discovered that you love?

Hila Qu (01:29:33):
I would say, similar to everyone, ChatGPT. But also Lululemon yoga pants.

Lenny (01:29:43):
Amazing. Great. What's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact on a team's ability to execute?

Hila Qu (01:29:51):
Yeah. At first I added basically a section in the dock, in the ticket stack. Ask the PMs to write the success metric ahead of time. As well as adding which of the growth lever this is helping. Is this contributing to acquisition, activation, retention, monetization? And it forced them to sometimes think through deeply, "Why are we even doing this?" Sometimes they ended up not doing that by just writing it down.

Lenny (01:30:23):
I love that. Next question. I know you're big on children's books, do you have a favorite children's book?

Hila Qu (01:30:29):
My favorite children's book is called Someday, and I recommend everyone to check it out. And basically it's talking about how our children used to be our baby, become our kids, and when they are taller and more stronger than us and they will remember us.

Lenny (01:30:51):
I'm going to need to check that out now. And final question. I know you're big on growth concepts, you have all these frameworks and concepts. And so what is your favorite growth concept?

Hila Qu (01:31:02):
I would say north star metric, because I find it's not only valuable to growth, it's valuable to just everything.

(01:31:10):
When I think about what do I want to do with my career, does that fit my own personal north star metric? When I think about how I want to raise my kids, I think about what's the north star metric for successful education for my kid?

(01:31:27):
Because it forced me to think long term. It forced me to think about what's valuable to me, to them, not only by the society standards, ARR revenue, like salary. And also what's my vision for myself and for my kids.

Lenny (01:31:43):
I love that. It reminds me of a recent guest where she always asks, "What are you optimizing for?" Whether she's talking with her kids or her husband or her team, and it's a similar concept.

(01:31:54):
Hila, this was incredible. I think we've shared tens of thousands of dollars of value, and it will probably lead to millions of dollars of revenue for a lot of companies. And it's everything I hoped it would be. Thank you so much for being here and for sharing so much wisdom.

(01:32:08):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Hila Qu (01:32:15):
Yeah, they can find me on LinkedIn. Just search Hila Qu, H-I-L-A Q-U. You can find me. I have a personal website that's under development, but I contracted it to my kid, to my 12-year-old. So he need to wait until summer and hopefully this summer he can finish it.

(01:32:32):
Yeah, if you are a founder, you are looking for a growth advisor, feel free to hit me up. I'm always happy to just have a call with founders and leaders, get to know more people. And I'm a growth nerd, so I always want to nerd about growth anyway.

Lenny (01:32:51):
Amazing. Hila, again, thank you so much for being here.

Hila Qu (01:32:54):
Thank you.

Lenny (01:32:55):
Bye, everyone.

Hila Qu (01:32:56):

(03:22):
First up, we've got Eeke De Miliano. Eeke was head of product at Retool. She was also a PM at Stripe. Currently, she's actually starting her own company. Here's Eeke sharing her favorite interview question.

Eeke De Miliano (03:36):
"To what do you attribute your success?" And you can't say "luck". Because I think humble people will always say "luck" in some way, and I always kind of want to know, how self-aware are you, basically, and how curious are you? I think people have really sort of gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today really says a lot about how they think about the world.

Lenny (03:58):
Next up, we've got Geoff Charles, Head of Product at Ramp, and also just happens to be one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Geoff Charles (04:06):
I ask, "What's the hardest thing you've ever done?" I ask that because working at Ramp is hard, and I want to understand what hard means for them. I want to understand why it was hard. I want to understand how they overcame that difficulty, how they worked with other people to overcome that difficulty, and how much agency they had in overcoming that. So it's a really good sign around what is difficulty to them and how much work they put into overcoming that.

Lenny (04:31):
Next up we've got Shishir Mehrotra CEO, and Co-founder of Coda. Funny enough, we posted this exact clip to TikTok and Instagram Reels, and it blew up. It's one of the most popular clips we've ever put on our channels. By the way, did you know I have a TikTok and an Instagram channel? Just look up Lenny's Podcast on TikTok or Instagram. Anyway, with that, here's Shishir Mehrotra sharing his favorite interview question.

Shishir Mehrotra (04:56):
It's a very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test. The question is, "A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be their business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:05:14]." This question will actually work well for any role. But say, "You could be a product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do?" That's the whole question.

(05:23):
Usually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, "Well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Is it small? Is it vast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?" All these different questions come out.

(05:39):
I'll just let those questions come out, and at some point I'll say, "Okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions, and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask?"

(05:59):
Interestingly, all of a sudden the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the one or two Eigenquestions on this topic. There's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones, because the product manager said, "Okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one, is it safe enough for humans or not?" That was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? They didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this. "Just tell me, is it safe enough for humans or not?"

(06:31):
The second one is, "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?"

(06:37):
And then he took those two questions, and he said, "Just with those two questions, I can form these quadrants." You can say, "Oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run." Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, "Hey, look, it's expensive to use, but you all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it."

(06:59):
On the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run, you'd probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you'd probably do is replace airports. Because airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places.

(07:12):
If it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways? And people come up with, "Do you do the most expensive things? Is teleporting people's replacement [inaudible 00:07:29], is that a really demanding thing?"

(07:32):
But these two questions kind of get to the heart of it. The question is totally made up. No teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes.

(07:45):
That question, by the way, if you ask a kid that question, the new teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions. Again, kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves. A lot of your candidates tell me things like, "I guess I would ask them what size it is." I'm like, "Why would you ask them? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size it is?" Sometimes they can explain it, but sometimes not. They don't get hired.

(08:16):
But then, actually, the thing I'd say about it is, there are Eigenquestion kind of everywhere. You could take any product out there. I'll do it with my kids a lot. I was just riding with with my younger daughter, and she said, "How come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that?" That's a really insightful observation. What's the Eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station? You can almost take anything and say, "What is the question that really drives this answer?"

Lenny (08:45):
This next interview question comes from Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma, also a former Head of Design at Uber.

Yuhki Yamashita (08:53):
"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?" All those things. I think it's really revealing, because if they can set up this conflict and understand why this problem was really important and represent both sides and such that you can understand why that conflict existed in the first place, and they can do it in this kind of even-keeled way where you realize that they can take on these different perspectives, you start to learn a lot about that person, I think.

(09:25):
Or sometimes I just ask them for basic things like, "Okay, talk about a big problem that you worked on." The thought experiment for me is always, coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem? Right? No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, I think a really great product manager kind of casts something. It's like, "Well, this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting, and really rallied the troops up. That's kind of one big thing of storytelling and communication, because at the end of the day, so much of our job is around that.

Lenny (09:57):
Next you'll hear from Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarine, CEO of Linear; and Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify, former Product Leader at Patreon; who all share the same favorite interview question.

Katie Dill (10:12):
"Tell me what work you are most proud of?" The reason I ask that is because, well, it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.

Karri Saarinen (10:36):
I think usually I like to ask what is the candidate most proud of and why on their professional life or otherwise. What they're most proud of and why? But I think it's gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well, and we can spend time on it, versus just asking something more negative things.

Camille Hearst (11:04):
I like to ask people to tell me about something they're really proud of that they accomplished, take me through the process, and talk to me about why they're proud of it. I find you can learn so much about a person's motivations, about their work ethic, about what they care about, what good looks like to them, and I think those are all really important things to understand about a person if you're going to work closely with them.

Lenny (11:29):
Next is JZ, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb colleague, sharing her favorite interview question.

Jiaona Zhang (11:35):
I do like to do behavioral questions. Just really understanding, when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?

(11:44):
Ambiguity is a big one for me, because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity," but actually put a path forward.

(12:05):
I think, also, looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs, as opposed to being like, "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear." Because, again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing, is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, "This is the path. This is how I learned why I put this path together." And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, "Hey, is this working? Is this not working?" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.

Lenny (12:44):
Next up is Noah Weiss, Chief Product Officer at Slack.

Noah Weiss (12:49):
"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?" When I say "unfair" or "secret", I usually mean not something that you probably read on a media [inaudible 00:13:02]. "What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work, and how do you apply it?" You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that.

Lenny (13:11):
This next question comes from the very sultry voice of Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk and now an advisor to product-led growth startups.

Ben Williams (13:22):
"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?" A lot of people will default to telling you where they aspire to be in terms of role or title, but what I'm really looking for is signals of humility, of self-awareness, around areas of personal and professional growth. People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people. I love that.

(13:49):
Also, just generally throughout interviews, I'm looking for curiosity. Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking "why" as much as my six-year-old son does, which is a lot, so I'll try and discern that through the course of the conversation. It's not really a question, but something I'm looking for.

(14:08):
And then maybe I want to flip it, because building on something that Adam Fishman was saying, his theme of evaluating the people dimension of folks you are potentially going to work with when you're interviewing with a company. This was a question I got asked myself recently by a candidate, which I just thought was brilliant, and that was, "Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?" It just felt like a really great way for them to be able to test alignment of their personal values with those of someone they'd be working with really closely, so I love that.

Lenny (14:42):
Next up is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth and a very early employee at Deel.

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (14:48):
"What would your siblings say about you?" It's very telling. If they have siblings; if they don't, I will say, "What will your parents say about you?" But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.

Lenny (15:00):
What do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?

Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (15:05):
I look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me. She'll talk to me a lot. Being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, "My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together," that's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, "Oh, yeah, they'll say these weird things about me," that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.

Lenny (15:30):
Next is Paige Costello, Co-Head of Product Management, and also Head of AI at Asana.

Paige Costello (15:36):
I like to ask, "Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it?" Yada, yada. Effectively, the question gets at, when the product failed, when something about the team didn't work, just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work. Evaluating people's mindset, the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation, I think it's a great question. It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.

Lenny (16:15):
We are in the final stretch now. There's only five more interview questions to go. Next up is Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook, also one of the most popular episodes of the podcast.

Nikhyl Singhal (16:25):
"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?" Sometimes I'll ask a manager, "Look, you've managed hundreds of people in your career. What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?" And you could do that for, "What do people think about AI that's inaccurate, that everyone believes?" You could do that for domains. You can do all kinds of things.

(16:53):
I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset. Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say. As a result, you can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine.

(17:19):
There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated. Because it starts with, 'What is the thing that you think ...? I want to sit here and then tell me why it's inaccurate." When I break that wall, I'm testing, is this person authentic? Because sometimes I'm dismissing them because they told me nothing new. But I don't want the interview process to penalize them, and this was my save question.

Lenny (17:52):
This next question comes from Ayo Omojola, Chief Product Officer at Carbon Health, former Product Lead at Square, and also a former founder.

Ayo Omojola (18:01):
"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would work," or, "Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work." A lot of my process is just teasing out introspection. It's just like, "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?"

Lenny (18:21):
Next up is Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe, former Chief Product Officer of Adobe, also former Founder of Behance.

Scott Belsky (18:31):
I like asking about something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work. It's a way to test introspection, and once this person hits their limits or struggles, can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers? So I do ask that.

(18:49):
I also like the question, "Do you consider yourself lucky?" I think it's a fascinating question, because some people who are super-insecure about where they are and how they got there and might decline admitting luck. Those who are comfortable should admit that they were lucky. I mean, I think the truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged, and I just think that that's always an interesting conversation.

Lenny (19:18):
Our penultimate interview question comes from Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Head of Growth at Airtable.

Lauryn Isford (19:26):
"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful." I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for a growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (19:46):
Our final interview question is actually advice for doing reference calls, which comes after finding someone great through your interview process. This comes from Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer at Intercom, with a killer Irish accent.

Paul Adams (20:00):
I have to do referral calls. You're interviewing someone, you want to give them the job, and they've got referees. Of course, the referees they have are the best people that they ever worked with and their favorite managers. This question is, "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?" It's an amazing question, because the person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening.

Lenny (20:23):
And it's a wrap. Thank you so much for listening. I hope you found this valuable. Leave a comment either on the newsletter post, or in the YouTube comments, or even on Twitter. Let me know what you think. If there's a great response, we'll continue to do this. If not, we'll never do this again. All right, thank you. Enjoy.

# Behind the product: Duolingo streaks | Jackson Shuttleworth (Group PM, Retention Team)

## Transcript

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:00):
... Duolingo is a $14 billion company, it's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up, but I think it doubled in value in the past six months. Streaks is the most impactful feature. We have, right now, over 9 million users with a year plus streak. If you look at the numbers, I think it's been our biggest growth lever. What Duolingo really focuses on is, how do we help users build habits around language learning? Getting user come back the next day is the biggest problem to solve.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):
Let's get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:30):
I'd say test everything, we've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the streaks, so every other day. We've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. We used to say continue, our standard CTA is continue, and we changed that to commit to my goal, and it was a massive win.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
There's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:00:55):
Say that you played a mobile game, or that you've done it for 3,000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today, my guest is Jackson Shuttleworth. Jackson is a group product manager at Duolingo, leading the retention team. This is a different kind of episode that I'm experimenting with, where we spent the entire conversation focused on the journey and lessons of a single feature, in this case, Duolingo streaks. Duolingo is a $14 billion business, just over the past six months, they doubled in value, they're hitting all time highs in usage and market cap, they're also one of the very few successful and also the single biggest consumer app business in the world. And as you'll hear from Jackson, the streaks feature is the single most impactful feature that most contributed to this growth and success. In other words, you could argue this one feature created billions of dollars of value, which to me means it is worth studying in depth.

(00:01:59):
In our conversation, Jackson shares the history of the streaks feature, all of the biggest wins and wrong turns they've taken along the way, what he and his team have learned about what works and doesn't work with a streaks mechanic, and also how they set up their teams to operate in a way that allows them to run over 600 experiments on this product and continue to find big wins.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:02:48):
Yeah, thank you. Long time listener, first time caller.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):
I appreciate it. So, this is going to be a really interesting conversation, I've never done an episode like this before, where we basically spent an hour, an hour and a half going into one feature of one product, but this is a very special feature, it's a very special product. Have you ever spent an hour, an hour and a half just talking about this one feature with anyone?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:03:13):
Well, internally, so when we onboard new folks to the team, we'll do, I actually just did this with somebody that joined the team recently, where we spent, yeah, I was like, hey, let's spend an hour just talking about the streak. We got through an hour and I got through about 30% of what I wanted to share, there's just so much, we'll talk about this, but there's so much that we've learned over the years, but never anything externally like this. I think we've shared bits and pieces of learnings, but this will be the motherload of learnings hopefully-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:14):
Here we go.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:03:41):
... of how Duolingo built the streak.

(00:06:03):
Okay, so for people that don't know anything about what Duolingo streaks are, can you just first give a brief explanation of what is Duolingo streaks? What is this feature all about?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:06:10):
Well, presumably people know, Duolingo is a language learning app, the Duolingo streak tracks, currently anyway, how many days in a row you've done a lesson. So, you come to Duolingo, you do a lesson, your first lesson you'll start a streak, and then every consecutive day that you come use the app, you'll extend your streak. And I should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility into the feature. So, we have these things called streak freezes, it's like insurance for your streaks. So, it's a pretty simple feature, in theory, but over time we've layered on challenges, and goal setting, and rewards, and social features... A lot of our notifications are tied to the streak. So, pretty simple feature to understand, but it's been a really rich feature for us to build on top of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):
Some people might be hearing this and be like, Duolingo streaks, what's the big deal? There's other people that are like, holy, I want to learn everything I can possibly learn about Duolingo streaks, so many companies are trying to copy what you've learned from this. Give people a sense of the impact that this one feature has had on Duolingo's success and growth.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:07:15):
And this is not just the subjective retention PM talking, I think this is our biggest feature, with the exception of the lessons. And I think it's actually [inaudible 00:07:24] start that. Streaks are a great engagement hack. I'm of the opinion that any team, any app out there can introduce a streak, and if you figure it out, it probably works to retain users, but at the core, you have to have an app that people want to use, and people really like using Duolingo. It's fun, it's delightful, you learn something. And so, it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that the streak is really powerful. So, it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs, again, it is one of our golden geese. And again, what's cool is that, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. Us sending better, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work because they reference the streak, because users care about the streak.

(00:08:10):
And so, not only is it itself, us iterating on the streak a huge driver of DAUs, but it's also something that enables other really high valuable features. I was looking up some stats before I came on, and it's pretty crazy. So, we have right now over 9 million users with a year plus streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:30):
Wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:08:30):
So, 9 million of our users have used Duolingo every year, almost every day, for well over a year. Which is pretty... I don't know, I like to imagine things in terms of like, okay, well, if you put all these people in a city, or in a place, where would it be? I'm like, ah, it's like a very large city, 9 million people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):
For a year, have a year long streak.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:08:53):
For a year.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):
That's incredible. I was just looking at the stock of Duolingo, so Duolingo is a $14 billion company at the time we're recording this. It's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up. I think it doubled in value in the past six months, something like that. And what I'm hearing from you is streaks is, other than just the core learning feature, which is just the product of Duolingo, this is the most feature in terms of growth, and in that retention specifically.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:09:24):
If you look at the numbers, I think pretty objectively has been our biggest growth lever for driving DAUs, and also say a lot of it's just related to how we think about growth at Duolingo. And a lot of what we try to do is organic growth. We think about growth just as much as bringing new users onto the platform is not losing them. If you're just bringing people onto the platform, then they churn, that's not going to be sustainable. And so, as much as we can do to keep our users coming back and actually retaining as users, it's going to give us a much easier base to continue growing DAUs off of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):
Perfect. Okay. Talk about how this feature originally came to be. What was the original version of it? What was the original insight that led to [inaudible 00:10:05]-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:10:04):
Yeah, so the oldest streaks or as old as Duolingo itself. When we launched Duolingo, we launched with a streak... And I say we, I was just graduating undergrad when Duolingo launched. So, this is well before my time. But we launched with a streak feature. Initially how the feature worked was you'd come to Duolingo and you'd set a goal for yourself, and it was an XP based goal. So, Duolingo, a little bit of nomenclature, we have an experience point based system that drives a lot of our features in the app. And the way you'd set it is you'd say, based on what your language learning goal was, maybe you have a 10 experience point goal versus a 50 experience point goal. And so, extending your streak would be, hey, can you hit 50 experience points? If that's what you set your goal to be.

(00:10:50):
And this worked well, I think this also speaks to how Duolingo initially grew. Luis launched it with a TEDTalk, we probably had a more tech-forward user base initially, and so this whole idea of an experience points based streak system made sense. But what that also meant is that you could have a user come and use the app, do multiple lessons a day, and maybe they just set too hard of a goal for themselves, and then lose their streak. Which, you don't need to be an expert in streaks to understand that's probably not good. The nice thing with how we initially set it up though is it really did connect with what your goal was. So, if you were serious, let's track how good you are at being a serious language learner.

(00:11:28):
But I'd say one of the most impactful experiments we ran was about, this was actually as I was joining, or just after I joined we had run this experiment, was to move it from a XP based streak to just do one lesson a day, and you'd extend your streak. And the risk that you can sort of imagine is, well, then users kind of care less about it because it's not connected with their goal. And we saw none of that. This was a huge driver of DAUs, just making it easier to extend your streak, but I think really importantly it's still meaningful. The unit of use, and as you're thinking about building a streak, I think it's really important to think about what the unit of use of your app is. The unit of use for Duolingo is doing a lesson. And so, if what we care about is users coming back every day and doing a lesson, because it shows that they're actually engaging with the app, then it doesn't hurt us to make our streak focus on just do one unit versus multiple.

(00:12:23):
And so, that was probably the big [inaudible 00:12:25] change experiment that we ran at the time was moving from an XP-based streak to a one lesson streak. It's also simple, and I think that's one of the things to think about with streaks. It's always easy as a PM to have a million goals or objectives for what you want your feature to be and potentially build a more complex feature, and a one lesson streak, it's just easy for more users to understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):
Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. And just for folks that aren't super familiar with XP, it's basically experience points and you get them from doing things, it's like a [inaudible 00:12:53]-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:12:53):
Yeah, you do stuff on Duolingo, and then based on what you did and how well you did it, we give you experience points, this actually drives a number of our features in our apps. So, leaderboards is the big one, we have a leaderboard system, where you try over the course of the week, you battle with 29 other people, and you want to win, that's all driven by XP. So, we do have other features in the app that really benefit from this XP system-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:16):
Cool.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:13:16):
... the streak is just no longer one of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Awesome. Okay, so I want to talk about the journey from that point to what it is today, but a quick tangent, I saw Luis tweet just this week, someone asked him, "How do you decide whether to optimize for learning or engagement?" And he's like, "No question, everything we do is focused on engagement because you won't learn anything if you're not coming back to the app."

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:13:39):
As an engagement PM, that was the coolest thing he could have ever said. It's, well, again, very much as subjectively I guess as an engagement PM, that's how I've... I am sure the learning folks at Duolingo will cringe when they hear it, I see myself as a learning PM as much as an engagement PM, because the easiest way not to learn on Duolingo is not to come back the next day. And so, if we don't make the app retentive, you will have no opportunity to engage with our learning features. Now, I do think that there is a long tail of learning, where, if you start to dumb down, and honestly this is something we wrestle with the streak as well, you start to dumb down the experience, and your users aren't actually learning, they're not going to care.

(00:14:20):
Streaks work best when they're sitting on top of an app that users care about. But yeah, if you don't come learn on Duolingo.... If you don't come back to Duolingo, then you're not learning. We track a lot of this with, the work that we do, we make sure that as we're making changes to the streak, we're not hurting the learning experience and we don't have a ton of interaction with it. So, we're constantly thinking about this, but thank you Luis for saying that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):
It makes sense to me. Okay, so lets get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks. So, the first version went from XP to one lesson, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way to what we see today.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:15:03):
Duolingo has very much, has a strong test it philosophy, we're willing to test a lot of different... Honestly, we'd much rather test it than debate it for days and days. So, we actually followed up this experiment with, and this is a little bit later, with hey, what if we make it even easier to extend your streak? And so, we actually tested, hey, if you do one exercise, just one exercise in a lesson will extend your streak. A lot of the insight was good, you look at the funnel, hey, there's a lot of users who are starting but not finishing lessons, they're not extending your streak, the loss aversion doesn't kick in, they don't come back... So, this followed that train of thought. What we realized when we ran this experiment is DAUs moved not one bit. And what we were doing by... And if we go back to unit of measure, we had dumbed down the unit of... Nobody thinks about, oh, I just want to come do one question on Duolingo, nobody thinks about that.

(00:16:05):
So, we had a less clear unit of measure that we were basing our streak around, and the users that we were capturing with our streak, you come, you do one or two questions on Duolingo, then you leave, were the least engaged users imaginable. And so, I think that's something also to think about as you're building your streak, is like what is the user that you're solving for? So, not only what is the habit that you're building for, but what is the level of commitment, and that was an example where we over indexed on a type of user who we honestly just weren't going to keep, that was a very easy shutdown decision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:39):
That's an awesome story, just to comment in that real quick. Just you went, let's just go to the extreme and make it just like streaks, yeah, get everyone going streaks forever, and then... I love that it turned out and it's not bringing users that you want, and it's dumbing down experience. It makes me think of Farmville, where you have to go and harvest your crops every, whatever, hour, that lasts for a bit and then eventually people are like, what the hell am I doing with my life?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:17:04):
Yeah, exactly. We test every, I was looking at the numbers as well, we've run in the last four years, over 600 experiments on the streaks. So, every other day effectively-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):
600, wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:17:15):
... we're running an experiment. And they range from big, like this, changing how the mechanic works, to let's swap a string with another string and see if that copy is better for users. So, we're constantly testing on everything. I do think that, I'd be more careful running that experiment now, at some point your streak gets big enough that, again, I got 9 million users on the streak, I got to be really careful... Those are our best retaining users, you got to be careful. But in the early days of the streak, I'd say test everything. See what... Don't get super caught up in it has to be like this, just test a bunch of stuff and see what speaks most to users. Because I think, again, you will constantly be surprised by the insights that you get from whether you... We shut down about half of our experiments, so half of our experiments lose, we still learned a ton by virtue of running them. So, super, super valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:08):
That's actually a good success rate, a lot of companies have only 20% of experiments be positive. What's your policy on if it's neutral, do you ship it, or do you kill it?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:18:18):
It really depends. If we're adding something and it's neutral, we tend to shut it down because it's just more cognitive load, it's something that we're going to have to start building around, a new UI element that we have to figure out how it fits into our system. I'd say when we do ship a neutral experiment is, something that we have real conviction around, okay, yeah, maybe this was neutral but it's going to give us a new platform to then build on top of, so that experience might be neutral, but now we can build these DAU positive experiments. My general take there is though, in that case, build that in as part of your V1 so that you make sure that at least your hypothesis around this roadmap has play should probably be the case, but in general, shutting down a neutral experiment so you don't introduce more complexity to the app is the way we tend to go.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
Makes sense. All right, what else? What else have you learned along the journey?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:19:13):
Well, maybe I can talk about a few different ways that we structure, a few different themes that I think we lean on. So, the first is focusing on the zero to seven day user experience. And I would say this is, if you look at whatever our breakdown of experiments are, we run definitely more than average number of experiments on getting users to go from a zero to seven day streak. And a lot of this is because we've looked at the data for our retention curves, and what we found is that once you get to seven days, loss aversion kicks in, and you retain. So, going from a one to a two-day streak, huge jump in retention, two to three day streak, slightly less but still huge and it's up until day seven. Once you hit day seven, it flans out. And it's not to say that if you have a 30-day streak, you're way more attentive than day seven, but not in the order of magnitude that it is from day one through seven.

(00:20:05):
So, we do a ton of work to get users to that point where loss aversion kicks in, and then they don't want to lead the app. One of the fun ones that we did, and it's honestly as much about process as it is about the feature itself, was we have a feature called streak goal, and it is... Again, so much of this stuff seems so obvious in retrospect, but it was really novel at the time. We had this idea of like, hey, maybe we'll just goal users to hitting a certain streak length. As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful user psychology, and we started with the simplest version of this. And this is how Duolingo does a lot of our testing. Rather than design the big complex feature for V1, just do the simplest encapsulation of what that feature can be, see if it has legs, and then just add to it iteratively over time, this is partially how we get to 600+ experiments on streaks, they're not all big ones.

(00:21:01):
But we started... And it was funny, we actually took a learning from our monetization win teams. One of the strings that they had, the pieces of copy that they had, worked really, really well was, I think it was your 5.6 x more likely to finish the course if you subscribe to Plus. Now, it's Super, our subscription. It was a really good hook that if you really cared, you'd sign up. And so, we had a similar thought, where it's like, oh, let's just tell you how much more likely you are to finish the course if you get a 30-day streak.

(00:21:34):
And so, we started with that, and I think it was like you're seven times more likely to finish the course if you have a 30-day streak, and just that message when you started your streak, I telling you that, was awesome. Huge win. Indicating an outcome... And Duolingo doesn't have, we have a gem economy but we don't actually have, it's all you learning. But being able to actually talk about it in terms of the outcomes that a user would think about, in this case, trying to finish the course, was a huge win. So, this is where we started and we're like, ah, goal setting, all right, we should go much harder on this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:06):
Found a-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:22:06):
Yeah, we found our thing, and now let's just beat the heck out of it. So, we followed that up with another experiment, where we tested different lengths. So, we test 14 days and 50 days, and we found that they were all good, but they appealed to different users. And so, we started to realize, all right, well, we probably need to be more thoughtful about who we give these different options to. And so, then we followed that experiment up with, all right, let's start with 30 days, and then we're going to let you opt out, we'll say, no, I don't think I can hit it. And our thinking was, and then if you say no, we'll hit you with an easier goal. Because we just wanted to get you to commit to a goal. And this was a fascinating one because it was a good win to give users that easier goal, to try to capture them before they said no, but it was almost just as big a win to add that opt out button.

(00:22:58):
So, we tested separately, and I'm a huge fan of testing way too many arms for an experiment, just to be able to isolate your hypotheses, but we captured just what happens if we add an opt-out button, and adding an opt-out button... And you would think, as a PM, oh, now users might not engage with my feature, that's a bad thing, but it was a huge win to let them do that. And the learning here was that this intentionality of saying, no, I want it... Previously it was just a continue button, but now it's like, no, I want to hit 30 days, and having that be an intentional decision for them, yes or no, even though again, this had no impact, or no impact past this screen. Everything that I'm talking about now was just that screen that day, and then was all thrown out. So, that optionality was a huge insight, and so because of that, we built a goal setting feature where you could choose between different goals, giving users that optionality was likewise a huge win.

(00:23:57):
I'll say one final learning on this, again, you talk about friction, and good and bad friction, we thought once we built a goal picker screen, where you could pick between different streak lengths, we were like, oh, well, let's recommend that users do a harder goal, thinking that okay, well, a harder goal is going to be better retention, and we'll the preselect harder goal for them. And based on all the learnings that I just shared with you, you probably imagine lost pretty significantly, we realized that yes, we could speed users through the screen more by virtue of picking a goal for them, but that act of selecting, I think it's 30 days, I think it's 14 days, was where we were getting so much of the engagement from this feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):
There's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates, it feels like you guys should write a book on human psychology and motivation.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:24:51):
I feel very much like a amateur armchair psychologist with everything that, at least as far as people who want to learn languages on their phone go, I really understand those folks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:03):
Right. So, one theme I'm hearing here so far is you guys are basically just mining for gold, just looking for a vein in some mine, and once you hit it you're like, ooh, this worked, you just go crazy on just testing all kinds of things to see how far you can take that one little thread.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:25:22):
Yeah, and I think, I shared how this idea came partially from a monetization win that they had, I think there's a lot of, because Duolingo runs... I don't know what percentile we're in, but it's got to be a very high percentile of per capita experiments run for a company, based on company size. We're just constantly learning so many things and there's a really great cross-sharing of monetization say, hey, this thing worked for us, is that something you can use? So, I'd say it's rare that we go into something where it's just like, let's just try something. Typically, we have some insight because of all of these experiments that we've run, that hey, if we do this, I don't know, it's one here, or it's worked here, it's driven this user engagement, if we massage that and try in this scenario, or a different screen, we come in at least with a strong hypothesis of this will work.

(00:26:17):
A lot of times we do look, and we're like, a lot of the apps that we look at actually are games themselves, so it's like, all right, you're playing Royal Match, or there's the new Pokemon trading card game that I'm spending way too much time on, you look at these games and see what they're doing, and it's really good fodder for what we can do. But a lot of times you're at least going in with a strong hypothesis based on what you've seen work elsewhere.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):
Got it. So, just to double down on that point, it's not just random experiments, it's here's a hypothesis we're fairly confident, or has a chance to be true, let's try it. It's not just let's just try everything?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:26:49):
Yeah. And I think that how strongly you feel about the hypothesis directly ties to how hard that experiment is. With copy, for instance, we've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. I'm of the opinion that companies should run, as long as you have the user base to do it, copy test constantly. The amount of copy tests that we've had that have won, and I don't know, you just try things and you figure out what wins is definitely legion, and [inaudible 00:27:15] massive wins from little copy changes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):
Is there an example of that, of just the impact?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:27:20):
Going back to that goal screen, we used to say Continue, our standard CTA is Continue, and we changed that to Commit To My Goal, and it was a massive win. And again, it was like, okay, users tapping on that, what are we asking them to do? Commit to the goal, what is that going to lead them to do? Commit, not churn. Just that little copy change, that one time, right there, led to huge wins. And copy changes are so cheap, it's just you translate, for us, we have a lot of users all over the world, and a lot of UI languages, but just come up with a bunch of ideas, translate some strings... This is one where the feedback that you'll typically get from Luis. So, all of our changes at Duolingo go through product review that are reviewed by Luis, so Luis reviews every single change that we propose, every experiment that we run.

(00:28:12):
Typically with copy, he's just like, I don't know, test it, there's nothing better than be told by Luis, I don't think this is going to win, but sure, if you want to. And a lot of times, to his credit, he's right, and a lot of times our intuition was right, but it's just so cheap to do it. I think when the lift is smaller, it's great to have a hypothesis, but you don't need to beat it up too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:36):
So, on this thread, I didn't realize Louis reviews everything you're planning to change, and this may be the answer to the question I was going to ask, which is, one of the criticisms of running a product and company this way, of just experimenting constantly with all these micro improvements and changes, is it can lead to something, like a monstrosity of a product and experience that isn't consistent and cohesive, and just that often happens. Is the solution to that having the founder basically review all the changes? Is there anything else y'all do to avoid it becoming Farmville or whatever, is a good example of that?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:29:06):
Yeah, our product review structure where we've got our head of product design, one of the lead, the product management leaders, and then Luis, NPR. And because they see everything, and they have a really high product bar, and so that helps. I think over time we just, as PMs, have to look at, okay, where is our feature headed? And so, we do this with the streak at least on a quarterly basis, to look at, okay, well, what have we learned, how has our streak developed, and how do we imagine this going in near future? It's easy to do, and in some sort of awful local maxima, if you're not constantly looking at your roadmap and you don't have a clear strategy. For me it's like, if you have a clear strategy where your feature is going, hopefully all of those A/B tests are not just done to get some cheap gain, they're done with a long-term goal in mind.

(00:30:03):
I do think though, and we do this every now and then with the streak, eventually you just hit a local maxima, and you say, you talked about launching neutral experiments, this is a great example, where it's like all right, cool, now we need to throw a bunch of this stuff out, based on all the learnings, can we reset this real estate, can we reset this UI, reset this feature, in such a way that is just as good as what we have now but is way more plain or simple, that we can, again, start to layer on? Those are really hard experiments to get to win obviously, because they are so optimized, but they're really important to do, otherwise, yeah, you just end up with a kitchen sink of a feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):
One other tidbit I just want to mention, an advantage you all have that other companies don't have is people want to learn a language, and so getting pushed to come back to an app for something that they want to do, it's not an advantage a lot of products have. So, anything you want to add there, of just like this is why Duolingo might be a little different from what you're working on.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:31:03):
That is definitely a benefit, if I had an app... And that this is actually why I think a lot of mobile games do streaks differently, because to say that you played a mobile game, and as somebody who plays a lot of mobile games, that you've done it for 3000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3000 days in a row. I think the comparison set is much larger though, than a lot of companies give themselves credit for, and I think that there's... There's a lot of ways that companies think about their... There are very few companies I imagine out there in the world saying, oh, we don't do some degree of good for our users... Even if it's like a game, it's like, I don't know, you're giving somebody a moment away from the craziness of their lives.

(00:31:47):
And so, I do think though that is contingent on companies who are going to figure out if a streak works for them, to figure out how can you frame the streak in such a way that a user does feel good about it. And it's easier for a Duolingo, but I think there's creative ways to phrase this for users. The other thing maybe just on that that I'll say is, the streak works really well for Duolingo because with language learning it's really hard to see day-to-day progress in becoming more fluent. And fluency is not even the right word, it's like becoming better at Spanish or whatever, it is a years long process for someone to get better at a language.

(00:32:25):
Duolingo makes it easier, but you still got to put in thousands of hours if you're going to reach C1 or C2 fluency, and that is really hard to track on a day-to-day, and so the streak works really well for us because we might not be able to tell you, hey, you now know 0.01% more Spanish, but we can show you, hey, you've gotten your streak a little bit higher. And so, I think this works particularly well when you're an app that is doing something that's going to be sensed or felt over a longer term to help contextualize that progress in a way that makes more sense, or at least feels more tangible to a user.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:02):
Great, that was a great context. Empowering to a lot of companies that aren't necessarily doing language learning. Okay. So, it took us on a long tangent away from lessons and experiments you ran along the journey of iterating on the streak. So, a few things you've shared so far is just, it started with this XP idea, and then went to a lesson, then you iterated on ways to make it simpler, maybe harder, you added streak goals, where you commit to I'm going to hit a certain goal of streak. What else? What else have you found that has worked, didn't work, lessons learned?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:33:32):
Again, sticking with this one to seven day streak, the idea of a streak, particularly probably to this audience, is obvious. Like, oh, it's a streak, it just counts how many days. We've realized over time that a lot of users do not understand how a streak works, and it can be as small as, well, I don't understand how streak freezes work, or I don't... Like my mom the other day was talking to you about it, she's like, "Oh, I didn't use Duolingo and I come back and my streak's still there." So, there's certain elements of the feature that we can do better at explaining, but even what a streak is, it's tracking how many days that I've used the app, yeah, the more that we can make the feature easily comprehensible to users, the more retentive it is. And we've run a number of experiments to do this.

(00:34:23):
You asked about early easy copy changes that we made. Actually, this is my first win experiment when I joined Duolingo was, when you start a streak, we have little copy at the bottom of the screen that just, I don't know, it's like flavor copy, we use it to celebrate you, or give you context, and I ran some tests that just tried to in eight words explained what a streak was, that was it. And it was a massive win because it really dumbed down here is exactly how the streak worked, and it really helped users just understand what they needed to do. And I think this is something that's like, you constantly got to remind yourself, particularly if you work in tech and you're building cool tech features, but your user base is not a bunch of tech workers, to think about, all right, who is my audience? And for us it's not just tech workers, it's not people in America, it's people all over the world of all ages of all cultures, and so making sure that your feature is even something as simple as the streak is understandable is critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):
What was the actual copy, do you remember?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:29):
It was... I think it's still on the app, it's like, "Start a day to extend your streak, but miss a day and it resets," something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:38):
That makes sense to me. Very clear.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:40):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):
In eight words, I love that. Okay. And then, when you say massive win by the way, just to give people a reference point, what does that look like? What is a massive win in this scale?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:35:50):
Well, and it's funny, and this was four years ago, but I think it was in the order of magnitude of over 10,000 DAUs for us, and actually, maybe a small bit of context. So, Duolingo really cares about the metric CURR current user retention rate, and actually our first ever Duolingo post with Lenny was the newsletter that our former head of product wrote, Jorge.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):
Still the single most popular newsletter post of all time in my newsletter, across 300 plus-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:36:15):
I would highly recommend that if you were interested in this, give it a read. To summarize, basically, what we found is that, if we wanted to drive DAUs, and Duolingo cares, our growth North Star is DAUs, the metric that is most effective, where a percentage change in that metric is most effective at driving DAUs is current user retention rate. And this is just users who are not new or resurrected, getting them to come back tomorrow. And so, most of the work that our teams do, our retention-based teams do is focused on CURR. And so, the retention team that I lead focused on CURR, it just so happens the streak is the best feature at driving CURR. And so, this experiment was the biggest CURR win that we had had, and it was like a top three CURR win, anyway for us. Just this little copy. And that's why I say, test copy 1000 different ways, sometimes it's not the big beautiful feature that's going to drive the huge gains, sometimes it's just something simple as a few words.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):
I love this. Okay, so you said 10,000 DAUs, I think that references you guys measure incremental impact and absolute numbers of new daily users you're going to drive attributed to that experiment, is what it sounds like.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:37:28):
Yeah, and we do both. We'll also look at, a lot of times I'll look at, for retention, day one versus day seven versus day 14, a lot of what I'm looking for is for us to have a better day 14 impact than better day one impact because it means that users are retaining better over time. This is particularly for users that would see a feature multiple times. I just like absolute DAU numbers because as long as you're controlling for different biases, like a recency bias or a novelty bias, it's a really easy way to just have an absolute comparison. You start to look at percentage changes and then it's influenced by who your treatment, how many users saw the experiment, but at least an absolute number is easier, in my mind, to start comparing.. Again, there are pitfalls with it, but we find that that's a pretty useful way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):
That lesson comes up a lot on this podcast, and that approach to experiment.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:38:25):
[inaudible 00:38:25].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):
So, yeah, you're in good company. Quick tangent, if there's not an answer to this, no problem, coming back to the idea of just experimenting like crazy and not creating a product that nobody wants to use anymore, is there an example of an experiment that was positive that you all decided, no, we don't actually think this is what we want in the product, they ended up not shipping?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:38:47):
Retention doesn't only work on the streak, although you would think... Most of our work is the streak. We've touched a lot of different surfaces over the years and there was one experiment that we launched that, we talked about XP earlier, in the lesson, the only UI elements are a progress bar at the top, and then how many hearts you have. So, we keep it really simple, and this very much speaks to the design philosophy of Duolingo, which is simpler UI is better, and we decided, hey, let's add XP in there. And so let's show your XP ticking up as you're going through a lesson, that's going to make the user feel good, it's going to show you what you've earned, you're going to be less likely to quit, all of these good reasons to do it. And then you finish the lesson and then we'll show you've collected all this XP.

(00:39:29):
And it won, the hypothesis was a good one. But we realized, and I remember having this conversation with Luis, is like, cool, this is our most important screen in the app, it is our lesson, it is where users learn, and the focus here is on learning. And now you've added this other thing up there that could be distracting for users. And I think the question, we talked about roadmaps and strategy here, the question that he had for me, and I didn't have a good answer for at the time, was like, so what else are you going to do with this? What's your iteration ideas? Where's this going to go? Is this going to make the lesson experience more gamified? And what we realized is that, honestly, it was just an easy engagement win idea, but we had touched our most sacred space in the app to do that.

(00:40:16):
And so, that was a case where it's like, yeah, it was a nice win, but we'd added that UI element, and at least at the time it was less clear what we would do with it and we realized that long term it was just going to get in the way, and we'd rather, for simplicity's sake, pause that, shut it down, and keep the lesson to be a little bit of learning sanctuary it was. Now, it's funny, nowadays I think we actually have enough XP based mechanics and fun things that we can do, that I think actually a lot of the beliefs about the in-lesson experience have changed, such as something like that could work, but at the time didn't feel good to keep that around.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):
That is an awesome example. Hopefully we have time to talk about how the team operates, where my mind goes is like, oh, but you have all these PMs and teams that want to show impact, and the performance reviews, and all that stuff, and you're not shipping something, they're like, oh look, we did a win. So, I want to chat about that later, but let's keep going on things you've learned and things that didn't work along the journey.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:41:15):
The other thing that I'll call out with the streak, it's like we have the... The image of the streak is this flame. And we have the streak flame, and it's very much core to our iconography. It's important to acknowledge that that's a metaphor for a retention mechanic. The idea of keeping a flame lit. And again, I think we've established the flame is for a lot of users as sort of their understanding of a streak, which is great, but there's a lot of people in different cultural context and different stages of life, where the idea of keeping a flame lit to show your commitment to something makes less sense. We did some UXR in India many years ago, and this was something that just did not resonate at all there, which was a really interesting learning. And that's something it's like, again, depending upon what your user base is, the more global UXR you can do to understand how users are actually understanding and experience your feature, the better, because you just, again, encounter insights like this.

(00:42:12):
And so, even our screen design, we used to have a flame, it was mostly this flame that would light up every day. But again, it was like an indication of a metaphor for a mechanic, and when we redesigned it, we did this, Kurt, one of our animators, did this awesome odometer animation where it's like your number would tick every day... It looked good, but from a product perspective, what was cool is we actually focused the design on the screen to show your number going up, and then it would say seven day streak, eight day streak. And I think that as you're thinking about designing around a streak, don't get too caught up into what is this the beautiful story that you're trying to tell, at the expense of it being a really comprehensible feature. And so, as you're thinking about product design, making that product design a clear distillation of this is what we're actually tracking, form should follow a function here, was a learning for us. And you'll see that now in a lot of places where we're showing streak, we're really leading with the number, not necessarily the flame.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
That's a theme that I'm hearing again and again is clarity, don't obsess with making it too clever, and don't ever think it, just clarity has a big impact.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:43:29):
Clarity also doesn't have to come at the expense of delight. And this is something where you hit a milestone and Duo gets, it becomes, we call him a Phoenix Duo, and he becomes awesome, and lights on fire, and I think there are things that you can do to still make the experience really exciting and delightful and celebratory, and I would not lose that, but just don't do it at the expense... And I think it's also about figuring out, you can get away with doing more of this for users who are deeper into their streak experience than users who are starting, where it's like your goal for the one-day streak user is just to make sure, do they understand how this feature works?

(00:44:06):
Even something... Again, just another random experiment. At the bottom of the streak screen we have a calendar, and over the years it just looks more and more calendar-like, and that is simply because we find that the more we make it look like a calendar, days on top, little circles, the check... The more we make it look like calendar, the more that people realize, hey, this is a daily mechanic. And so, think about the screen holistically, but every single thing that you're doing on the screen, how can you use it to communicate what is the point of this feature? How does it work?

(00:45:43):
I imagine one of the biggest wins was just giving people flexibility along the journey, like streak freezes and all these things, is that a big vein of opportunity discovery?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:45:52):
It is. Actually, I'm going to show you one of the most thoughtful gifts that anybody has ever given to me, this is our Duolingo Serenity, or Streak Serenity Prayer, my co-lead, Antonia-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):
It's like knitted, right?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:05):
... [inaudible 00:46:05] this for me. It's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):
Wow.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:06):
And so it says, "Luis, grant me the serenity to accept the flexibility I need, the courage to reach perfection when I can, and the wisdom to celebrate regardless."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):
Aw.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:15):
And that actually is kind of our strategy with the streaks.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):
I love the show and tell by the way, that was great.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:46:20):
Yeah. Well, I guess for podcast listeners, we'll have to get an image somewhere. This idea of flexibility versus perfection, and then regardless, celebration, is core to how we think about the streak. Because I think for the streak for us, it's very much a bend not break. If you're going to miss a day, I'd rather you come back, having missed that day, to an intact streak, but if you don't have to miss a day, I'd much rather you don't, I'd much rather you come back and use the app every day. So, that thing on flexibility though, that's almost certainly been the biggest, from a mechanic perspective, the biggest DAU driver. One of the earliest experiments we ran was going from you used to only be able to have one streak freeze and then we let you have either two or three. So, we tested two different arms. It was, again, another huge DAU win.

(00:47:12):
This actually is funny, it was something that... And this is, again, a callback to that growth model post from Jorge. It actually was really bad for CURR because we were basically saying, hey, you can take a day off, and that's okay, but it was really good for, this is going to be like Alphabet Soup, [inaudible 00:47:31], a weekly active user return rate. So, basically, users who had taken a day off, we were getting them to come back more at higher rates, and so it made up for our losses in CURR. But effectively, what this meant is that, why two streak freezes work better than one was, I don't know, sometimes people just need a little bit more flexibility than one day. But again, the really interesting insight of this experiment was that three streak freezes was actually no better than two streak freezes. And there were two competing things here, and I think this is important if you're going to build a streak to figure out what your flexibility mechanic is.

(00:48:03):
We were getting more users to return after longer times away to an intact streak. But if you start taking three days off from any habit, it's just going to be less likely that you return even four days later. And so, we had these competing things where more users might be returning to a streak, but a lot of users were also just not coming back, we were training them to take more time off. So, that flexibility, what's the right amount of... We've again, this is another area we've run hundreds of experiments on, what is the right amount of flexibility? And we are constantly surprised here. I still don't have the answer for at every point in your streak journey how much flexibility you need. One thing that I can say with certainty though is, give more flexibility when a user is starting their streak. Again, one of our biggest streak freeze experiment wins... I feel like I'm constantly saying this, one of our biggest wins, but they all were really, really big.

(00:48:59):
One of our biggest streak freeze wins was when you start a new streak, we give you two streak freezes. And again, it's so funny to think back, it's like how are we not doing this to begin with? But at the time, the streak freeze was an overly gamified mechanic, you had to buy them with gems, that's our in-app currency, because we wanted the whole idea of this to feel like it was really something you earned, that there was a little bit of pain to getting that streak freeze. And so, we tested though, what if we just give users when they start off their streak two streak freezes, and holy smokes to that win.

(00:49:33):
And it's sort of obvious now, in retrospect, but if you have a one or a two or a three-day streak, it's really easy just to let it die and restart, again, you need to get to seven days, what we've seen in the data, for it to really lock in. And so, giving users more flexibility so that it's harder to lose their streak initially, and then conversely, and this is what we keep learning, eventually, once people get on long streaks, you don't want to give them as much flexibility. Because there's a lot of times where, yeah, users don't... And I'm like this, I've got a 400-day streak. Note that that is a lot less time than I've been at Duolingo, I have lost and restarted streaks a lot of times at my time at Duolingo.

(00:50:14):
But you start getting on long streaks, and you really care about this feature, you really care about your streak. And most people, as long as you're not backpacking through, I don't know, the back country of Utah, you'll be in a place where you can get service. And so, figuring out who is the user that actually could use Duolingo, and not conditioning them to start taking days off that they didn't otherwise need to do is important to figure out where that line is for your feature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:46):
This is fascinating. You can also buy a streak, right? With money. That's a feature, right?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:50:51):
Yeah. And it's funny, this is also something that we [inaudible 00:50:54]-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:53):
You can buy a freeze, sorry, not a streak.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:50:56):
Yeah. So, you can buy a streak freeze, and the way it works is you can buy gems, and then you can use those gems to buy a streak... And this is something we wrestle with. We're actively working on an experiment, right now that's having a small hit to revenue, but it's a really nice win for retention, and I think it's actually worth thinking about from day one, as you're building a streak, do you see this more as a monetization feature, or do you see this more as a retention feature? What's the role of monetization in this? What's the role of retention? And I think for us it started out much more organically, and so we have a lot of monetization hooks, that again, is the retention PM, I would love to get rid of. But again, it's sort of part of how the streak works right now. And so, we always have this tension of, hey, if we start to make it harder to buy streak freezes, then fewer people buy them, buy gems to buy them, and so there's this more convoluted series of impacts that happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:49):
Yeah, no, I love that people wanting to buy streak freeze is like the ultimate sign of how much streaks matter.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:51:57):
Yeah, streak freeze is the other big one that we've recently demonetized, or introduced a free option for, is getting back a lost streak. So, used to lose a streak, we had a feature, in the day, back in the day, called Streak Repair, we'd give you your streak back, you had to pay gems. But what we found that worked way better was a feature called Earn Back, and this is basically where you would have to do a certain number of lessons, as long as you came back within a window soon after losing your streak, do a few lessons and we just give you your streak back. And that was such a retention winner. And again, what we thought about was it feels like you've earned it so much more when you've done... You deserve to have your streak back, we haven't cheapen the streak because you've done something.

(00:52:44):
And in this sense, this idea of cheapening the streak is something, like from a philosophical... Philosophy of the streak. From a philosophical level, we wrestle with all the time, of, cool, we're giving out more streak freezes, at what point do we cross the line and users start to realize their streak means nothing? Now, everything that we've seen, users are totally cool with using streak freezes and still thinking about their streak is this meaningful thing, but my co-lead, Antonia, who made that awesome cross-stitch for me, she is the keeper for us of the sanctity of the streak. And a lot of times as we... And I think this is really important to have, as you're thinking about building your streak. You can almost always get engagement wins, up to a certain point, by just cheapening the streak, making it easier to extend, letting users have more flexibility, but you kind of got to hold the line at some point.

(00:53:30):
And it's not clear where that line is. And once you... You talk about one-way doors or two-way doors, there's a point where you go too far and it's a one-way door, and all of a sudden those users, those 9 million users on one-year streaks don't care about their streak anymore. And that is, I don't know, again, retention PM perspective, that'd be an extinction level event for us. I don't want all of these users to stop caring about their streak. And so, to have somebody who is invested in the sanctity of this streak, and for us it's Antonia and Luis, he's very good about this, is really important, just so you make sure you don't go too far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):
That's an awesome insight. So, to protect... And push notifications I think are another example of this in general for companies, how much is too much? Because everyone is just like, let's just send another push, it's fine, just one more. And so, your solution to that is a person is like the keeper, and almost the gatekeeper, plus the founder, of how far is too far.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:26):
It's good if you can have that. I think push notifications are also easier because there's a lot of things you can do around, all right, we'll send a budget cap for how many notifications we'll send, you can-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):
It's like [inaudible 00:54:38] policy.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:38):
Yeah, policies. But I think with a lot of things, at least for the streak, it's harder to create policies for in the same way, a lot of it has to be done based on feel, and so you just got to use your best judgment at times.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):
Sweet. Okay. Any other, maybe one or two more lessons from this journey of what streaks has become today.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:54:56):
You mentioned notifications, and I've mentioned this a few times. One... It's funny, you tend to think of, exactly as you say, you can just always send another notification, it's going to be some win, and at some point it'll be a bad experience, but it's tough to see that. There's actually a notification that we... So, we send two notifications related to your core streak each day, the first is a practice reminder, we send it, this is actually an interesting insight, 23 and a half hours after you practice the day before. Whoa, that is a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:21):
23 and a half. Okay,

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:55:23):
So, basically, if you practice at noon today, we'll send it to you at 11:30 AM tomorrow, and we have done-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):
And it's, because it's like assuming they are free in that time the day before, maybe they'll be free at the same time?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:55:36):
And we actually moved, we used to let users set this practice reminder time, and our thinking was, cool, you're going to say 7:00 PM, that's when I really want to extend my streak each day, and then you know what? I say this to somebody with two kids, life gets in the way, life always gets in the way, and when you think you're going to practice will change, your life will change, whatever. And what we realize is the best indicator of when you should practice was when did you practice the day before. We could almost certainly get more detailed, we have tried a bunch of ways to have much more complex logic, and what always wins is 23 and a half hours.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):
That's so interesting. Revealed behavior versus stated.

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:56:10):
Yeah, exactly. So, again, we send this practice reminder 23 and a half hours later, the other thing that we'll do though is we'll send a, what we call a streak saver, and this is at 10:00 at night, if you have not extended your streak, we'll send you a message saying, hey, it's your last chance, this is it, if you don't extend your streak. And you would think that, that's kind of spammy, that's kind of annoying, to get a notification from an app at 10:00 PM, but what we found is because people care about their streak, their streak is this good thing that they attach positive emotions, that they don't really want to lose, that notification reminding them, hey, come back and... People see this by and large as a positive notification and not a negative notification.

(00:56:53):
Obviously, it serves our purpose as well of getting users to come back and not lose their streaks, but again, I think if you can think about your notification strategy related to what is the feature that it's tied to, how do users perceive that? You can almost certainly, not get away with more, but you can be thoughtful about notification load, and when to send notifications, and again, for us, this late night message, that's also highly impactful, super good, is actually something that could be perceived as spammy, but a lot of our users really do... Somebody who, it's often late at night, and I work here, and I'm like, oh, forgot to do my... I was think about Duolingo all day, here it is, 11:15, and I still haven't done it, that message is really powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:36):
Yeah. It has saved me many times, I totally know that message, and I love that it's a late night message from an app, very rarely do you actually, are happy about that, and I love that this actually is a good example where-

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:57:51):
It's really funny, all of the stories that you hear about people extending their streak, if you look around a Duolingo party, where it's like 11:30, 11:45, all the Duolingo employees, they're are doing their lesson at the last minute. You always see these pictures of people in the club doing, or at a concert doing Duolingo, and yeah, because it's like otherwise you're going to use a streak freezer, or God forbid you will lose your streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):
That's so funny. Okay, anything else? And if there's more than one more, definitely share, but any other really interesting lessons or wrong turns or insights?

Jackson Shuttleworth (00:58:23):
I talked about streak freezes, and we've done a lot with streak freeze, but I think if you're going to make flexibility a thing, it's probably also useful thinking about how do you celebrate perfection. And so, we have a feature that we have, it is the simplest thing in the world, it's called Perfect Streak. And it's just, if you don't use the streak freeze for a few days, we make your streak look gold, and we make your little progress bar on the calendar just look a little bit nicer. There's no reward for doing it, you don't get anything other than this nice little indication, and it is awesome. It is a simple feature, it is ultra not complex, and it is really powerful, not only for getting users to, as a bit of a reward, they'd be hey, get to seven days without using a streak freeze and your streak becomes perfect, but it's also a really nice indication of users who aren't using streak freezes.

(00:59:14):
Here is the thing that if you don't use a streak freeze, which, again candidly, I would love for you never to use a streak freeze, if you don't use a streak freeze, your streak will stay perfect. It's funny, we actually just, we're constantly responding to bug reports about the streak. It is... I swear to God, we have the best infrastructure around this feature because it is so important. We had an employee who lost her, I think a four-month perfect streak, and it was a big deal for her because she did her lesson, and she was crossing international dateline, there was a bunch of stuff going on that was like, it was just kind of weird in our backend. But people start to care about perfection as much as they do their streak, and for that person it was a big deal when they lost their perfect streak. And so, this is just an example of, look, if you're going to go after flexibility, which is good, finding a way to pull users back into perfection is a really important counterweight to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:13):
What I'm imagining is you guys need a Amazon style chatbot that just gives you the streak back, it's just like, okay, here you go.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:00:20):
We have very much... So, we have, if people lose their streak, there's ways to get in contact with us, but we've actually thought about that, where it's like, okay, we should just build a self-service feature, and if we think that your excuse is good enough, whatever, we'll just [inaudible 01:00:34].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
Yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:00:35].

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:00:36):
Because again, I'd much rather you be on a streak than have lost it, particularly [inaudible 01:00:41].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
Right. But it also can feel that easy. I love this, I also love this point about just the power of the animation and user experience having impact, that's really interesting. Is that something you find often, just celebrating and making it feel really amazing without copy or any feature is just like, holy, you're awesome?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:01:02):
This is another thing where it's like when users care about the feature, using not only animation, haptics, sound effects, using... And it's funny, we don't have sound effects on the streak, this is probably something we'll look at in the not too distant in future, but haptics are something we have done a lot of testing on-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):
Like the phone vibrating in various ways.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:01:20):
Yeah, exactly, your phone, there being a really cool haptic pattern as you extend your streak, all of this stuff wins. And it's cool because I think it wins... There's a few reasons. One is it just makes you feel good, you get some cool moment in your streak, and we celebrate you, and we celebrate you in this visual way, and your phone's buzzing, it just feels awesome. The other thing it does is it causes you to pause on that screen, and I think there's this desire, as you think through a lot of, as PMs think through, oh, how can I get users through this funnel as painlessly as possible? I talked about [inaudible 01:01:52]. There's a lot of times where I don't, I want you to stop. I want you to stop and land on the screen.

(01:01:56):
You got to be careful not to do this for too many screens, but the one big ones, sometimes I just want you to pause there and enjoy the moment. If I can get you to enjoy the moment more, you're going to care more about your streak, and you're going to be coming back tomorrow. And so, animations that are cool, and that cause you to really soak it in, haptics that feel good, all of that comes together to make you really focus on that moment, all of that just gets users more connected to their streak. So, animation in the right times works well and it's something we've had win quite a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):
Who designs the haptic stuff? Is there a haptic designer?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:02:33):
For the longest time it would be a product designer, or actually, it initially started as the engineer would be like, all right, would cobble together haptics, based on what they felt good, then it became a product design role, where they would use their best judgment. We actually just recently required an animation studio, Hobbs in Detroit, and now they are the sort of keepers of, they do a lot of motion design work, haptics very close to that, and so they do a lot of that. I do remember trying to hire for a while a haptics contractor, like haptics design, and it was the saddest hiring I've ever done, because it was just, I don't know, it was such a specific... I don't know. I just went through a lot of people who, it's just a really tricky space of kind of sound effects, kind of motion design, sort of technical...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:22):
Yeah, such a unique role.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:25):
Very unique specific skill set.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):
Right. And there's very few apps that really need this this deeply, so you're almost creating this person.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:32):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):
That is fascinating. That's like a whole podcast on its own. By the way, I was going to say as you're talking about this, I love that it's a win to celebrate people that don't lose their streak, you introduce this way to make it flexible, and that's a big win, and then you go the opposite direction of, if you don't use this feature, you also feel even better.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:03:51):
Well, and it's funny, you talked about the danger of feature bloat, or we sort of talked about the danger of feature bloat, this is actually something I'm constantly thinking about with this. We have the streak, but then we also have the perfect streak, and we count how many weeks you've had a perfect streak. Well, all of a sudden we have two streak numbers that are competing with each other. It's funny, we actually don't introduce the concept of a perfect streak until after you've hit seven days, and some of this is just because the cognitive load of additional streak features. A lot of our cooler streak features, you got to get on a long enough streak. And not to say we haven't tested it because we have, because we test everything, introducing these features earlier, but what we've found is that pretty universally they lose when we introduce too many things, too many concepts to users too early in the experience, it's just hard for them to manage.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:39):
Okay, sweet. I know that we can go down this track for hours and hours, there's endless learnings about all the things you all have done along the journey. I want to shift to talking about how your team operates. So, there's a lot of threads you touched on of just how a team can do this so well, shift 600 experiments, as you said, continue to find opportunity. What are some maybe lessons or advice you'd have for folks that are like, oh wow, I want to work more like this, from your team's experience, how does your team to operate that folks can learn from?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:05:13):
Yeah, maybe just a little bit of context. Duolingo cares a lot about... So, most of our teams are metric-based teams. So, we do the most work with streak, but the metric, what we really care about at the end of the day is CURR, and DAUs, because we see that DAUs hit CURR. And so, when you can be really laser focused on, my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up, I think it's much easier to make sure that you're working on the highest ROI thing. I think when you think more about like, oh, I want to make this feature better, I think it's easier to get lost in what better means, and how you think about better. And so, I do think that having a really strong degree of focus as a team on what is the metric that I'm caring about, and how is that directing my efforts is-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:59):
Versus feature-oriented. So, basically your teams are structured around a metric/a goal/outcome versus we own this feature, or this product.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:06:07):
So, retention owns streak, I guess, but that's only because we've seen streak drive CURR better than any feature. But we are not, we have this IAP hook with our streak freeze purchases, there are other teams that work on, that can and have worked on the streak, because it's not ours to say, no, no, no, we do all the iterations here, we just know that it drives our metric better. In the same way that leaderboards, we have a team that focuses on how much time you spent, we want users to spend more time on Duolingo so they're learning more. Leaderboards is the best vector for doing it, so that team does a lot of leaderboards work, but every now and then I have an idea that I think will be highly retentive, and I will go in, and I'll pitch to them, and then we'll do some change to the leaderboard to make it more retentive.

(01:06:53):
But I do think having that clear metric of we're trying to drive CURR not we're trying to just make this feature better, helps at least make sure, give the team clear marching orders, and that focus I think is really good for prioritizing backlog.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:07):
Cool. This is a really important point, this is the same way Airbnb worked, when I worked there for a long time, is it's, here's a goal that we want your team to be responsible for, you can work on any product you need to hit this goal, as you said, often various products are most connected to what you're doing, but what you're describing is, even though a team's kind of... I imagine you own it from a [inaudible 01:07:29] perspective, and you're like are the shepherd of this part of the feature because it hits your goal, helps your goal most. But any other team can come in and be like, hey Jackson, we need to work on some streak stuff to help with learning, you're like, go for it. Just a tangent there. Do they work really closely with your team if they want to do some work in the code? How does that work logistically?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:07:49):
Yeah. If you are, again, this is where I say there's soft ownership, we're not against teams doing things to the streak, but if we're going to do something given we probably have multiple quarters worth of a roadmap around the streak... I say probably, we do. Multiple quarters of roadmap for what we can do to the streak, if other teams want to come and mess with it, okay, we got to just figure out how is that going to work with what our plans for the streak were, how do we make sure a lot of times when teams are coming in thinking, hey, let's do this to the streak, they're in context that we might have, and so there's as much of a much simpler version of what we're doing now, a bit of a knowledge sharing, of saying, all right, well, this is what we think about the streak, this is what we've seen work, hasn't worked, how does that influence some of the hypothesis that you have. And so, I think getting that really... Making sure the juice is worth the squeeze.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):
Good old-fashioned product management work right there.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:08:34):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):
Cool. What else is interesting about how you all operate and how you all work to achieve this sort of success?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:08:41):
Again, my team lead runs, Antonia runs the most... A really process, if you're going to run this experiments, you have to be really process-oriented and really thoughtful about which experiments am I going to run when, how is that going to set up the next one, there's heavy Jira automation, I think sometimes the Atlassian suite makes my eyes bleed, but there's a lot of times where that degree of process helps the team unblock engineers and make them move really fast. And so, making sure that you have really good process around how are you going to run so many experiments, it's worth investing in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):
Can you follow that thread actually? Just when you say that, what does that look like? What are some elements of that process to make this work efficiently?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:09:25):
All the way down to, really detailed roadmaps around, all right, we're running this experiment is based on the results of this experiment, or might hook into an element of this feature, how do we make sure that we're lining up implementation on this so that as soon as this thing runs and we're ready to go, we can start rolling out the next one. I hate features just sitting around and us not, again, continuing that thread. So, it's not just thinking about what's our engineering bandwidth, but also what's the design bandwidth to make sure that we have the next iteration of this feature ready to go. We're planning months out, as we think about these feature iterations, even small ones, feature iterations, because when you lose cycles, not pushing on a feature, it's just sort of lost opportunity. And so, everything from being thoughtful about engineering roadmaps to design roadmaps to product roadmaps, all of that needs to come together in a system.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):
So, essentially, mapping dependencies across function, and you're saying in Jira you can do this.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:25):
You can do a lot of it in Jira, there is a non-zero amount of Google Docs that we have, that sometimes does things a little bit... I don't know, sometimes it just looks a little bit nicer, it's a little more flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):
Yeah. [inaudible 01:10:38].

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:37):
But Jira is our, it is where the motherload of process is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):
Great. Okay. What else?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:10:44):
Another thing that I'll just say is, we really resist the urge to do the big V1. And I think this is, I shared the streak goal example, where, a lot of times when we're exploring something we will say, okay, well, that's cool, how do we strip away a bunch of stuff and figure out what our core hypothesis is? And then, just ship that thing first as a V1. Because it's easy, and I've found this time and time again, it's easy to add things, features that make them win, I've worked in retention engagement long enough, I can add, I know enough things to pull, and bells to add, and whistles to make something win, but there's a lot of times where it's like cool, t [inaudible 01:11:27] because all the whistles you added, not because of what your core hypothesis was, and a lot of times if you can just really simplify what the feature is, it's also much easier to ship, it's easier to design.

(01:11:37):
You're not designing for a whole system, you're designing for something much simpler. And so, getting everybody to think that way, allows us to end up shipping faster, shipping simpler, designing faster, getting faster approval, getting insight, and then doing what I talked about with streak goal, being able to run iteration after iteration after iteration, add these things iteratively. And then not only by doing this are you able to move faster, but you get confidence at each step of the way, that, hey, my series of hypotheses is actually born out. Or if it's not, cool, then we're going to drop that part of the feature, and then just ship what actually matters.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):
If I can try to summarize the broad lesson so far that I'm hearing, and maybe you would've shared this, but I'm just thinking, if I were to try to design a company to operate, that we all operate, you essentially map all the levers that drive the business. So, you have this mapping of all the metrics that drive up to growth and daily active users. CURR ended up being the biggest specific metric to drive growth long term, so there's imagining a tree of all the opportunities you could work on, you found this is what is most connected to our growth. You basically just start mining, I don't know if mining is the right metaphor, but just looking for things that move that specific metric.

(01:13:04):
You just look and poke and explore, and then once you find one, you just go real deep on trying a lot of different... You come up with a hypothesis, and a strategy of here's how we think we can do this, and how we can move this, and then you just try a bunch of stuff. There's also this element of the Arrested Development quote, "There's always money in the banana stand," comes to mind, where it's just keep working on, see there's more, there's going to be more opportunity at this.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:13:29):
When I joined Duolingo, the PM that I took over for, Anton, who used to lead the retention team, I remember saying, "Dude, the streak, it just counts up, you guys have been testing on it for years, how much more work can we do on the streak?" And he was like, Jackson, you child... He didn't say exactly this, but this is how I felt it. Like, Jackson, you child, we're not even 30% of the way optimized. And four years later, I say that with such conviction, we are so far away from... We've made a ton of strides, but we are still so far away, and every quarter where we ship a ton of wins and improvements to the streak, it just continues to prove to me that there is so much more to be done.

(01:14:11):
So, I think your framing of it is... And I would say there's a lot of thought that goes into, again, I talk about the strength of the hypothesis that you have to have as you start to build out larger feature strategy, I do think it's really important to not just do a bunch of random stuff but do it with intent, with a goal in mind, otherwise, you do end up in these local maximas. But yeah, there's still a bunch of stuff that we haven't tried that I think we have high confidence in working out and so we'll keep doing that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:45):
Are there any other, say, lasting lessons from this journey that if someone were to try to operate this way, build streaks into their product, anything you'd recommend?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:14:55):
Yeah, I really do think it starts with... Streaks are an engagement hack. You can make your app more retentive, I'm almost positive, almost every app out there can make it more retentive. It is loss aversion, that is, again, armchair psychologist Jackson, it's just a thing that works on humans. But if your app is not something that users want to use every day, or whatever cadence you want your app to be, to work on, it's going to be, you're only going to get so much from that streak, and honestly, it's probably going to distract you from what really should matter, which is making your app something that people want to use every day.

(01:15:35):
And so, if you start focusing on the streak but you haven't made that an enjoyable experience, you're just going to waste a lot of time, honestly. And so, I think making sure that you have your core loop of your app figured out, that it is giving value to users, it is something that they want to come back to every day, that really sets the stage for something to layer a streak on. So, resist the temptation, if you don't think you've reached that point, to go too hard down the path of streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):
That's a really good point. Just like a streak is not going to solve your problems if people don't actually care about the core value you're providing.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:16:09):
No, and honestly, it'll probably cause more problems if what you end up focusing on is how do I make the streak highly engaging, but your app is... You're wasting time that could otherwise be better spent on solving more critical problems. So, that's one learning, the other thing that I'll say is, we met with one of our board members, Bing, Bing Gordon, a few weeks, or a few months ago rather, and he had this comment where he was just like, "The reason why users care about your streak so much is because you care about your streaks much." You being Duolingo. The reason why users care about our streak so much is because Duolingo cares about the streaks so much. And we're like, what do you mean? Well, he's like, well, after every session you see a big streak screen, and it's animated cooler than almost any other screen in the app, and then sometimes you see some other screens, and there's all these other... You don't let a user forget it, you talk about them in messages.

(01:17:01):
And so, I think it's worth thinking about, look, if you're going to build a streak, and then you're going to [inaudible 01:17:06] it off into the corner of your app, where users aren't going to see it, they're probably not going to care about it as much, which might be fine, because there might be other levers that you think are more important to pull on, but there's a reason why we focus as much on the streak as we do, and that's because we want it to be top of mind for users. And that's not by accident then that users start to care about it. And so, I think just as you're thinking about building the streak, making sure that you're giving it the visibility it deserves, if you want it to have the kind of impact that Duolingo has, it's sort of an important hierarchy principle to think about as you design things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):
That's such a good point. You look for cues to the app of tell me what I should pay attention to, what's important? If you're just like fire, explosions, you made a streak, oh, maybe I should pay attention to this feature. And then the push notifications obviously encourage you there too. Anything else along those lines?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:17:58):
Maybe final thing is, look, we ran so many tests on our Duolingo streak to figure out what worked. We have a philosophy at Duolingo, of test it first. We are a lot of times willing to test things. I really think that if you're going to try to introduce a streak, or you want to improve on the streak you have, don't get too caught up in the philosophy of everything, make sure your hypotheses feel like they're good, but my recommendation is just try things. And this is, again, you said it earlier, it's like this is as much human psychology as anything, and as soon as that becomes the case, you kind of just got to understand what users respond to. And the easiest way to do that is to stop spending time batting around ideas in a conference room and just try some stuff. So, huge recommendation to if you're going to invest in a streak, try and figure out what works through testing with users rather than trying to get it perfect on the first try.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):
Say someone's listening and they're like, should we do streak, is this worth doing? What's your take on just the chances that a streak feature would be helpful to another consumer?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:19:07):
I am well known for saying in the company that I think every team, every app could benefit from a streak. Now, how you implement it is very different, and I think you got to, what is your user's use case? If they're going to come use, I don't know, tax software... Okay, you know what? Now that I say this, tax software would be a hard one, but maybe it's all about you need users to come back every day, during the tax season, or how many times... I don't know. Now, that I say this out loud-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:35):
Times you upload your [inaudible 01:19:37] forms.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:19:37):
Yeah, that is a hard use case. But the vast majority of companies I think have a good idea of like, all right, here is my ideal use case, I want users to come here three times a month, that would be ideal. Or four times a month. You can build a streak to work. Peloton has weekly streaks because the idea of doing a Peloton workout every single day was hard for this user during COVID. It was just like every now and then you get on the Peloton, that was great, but the idea of a weekly streak was something that I could keep up. And so, I think figure out what your usage pattern is, as a user, and then build your streak around it. But as long as you're not a really, again, the tax example is probably a good counterfactual, but as long as you have some degree of frequency in your use, I think almost anything can have a streak.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:29):
So, Duolingo, it's, again, a $14 billion company, this feature, possibly the most contributing factor, other than the core product, to that level of success in market cap, and it's hard to imagine another just feature of a product that has had this much impact on growth and revenue and building this sort of business. So, I love that we spent this much time on it, the motherload, the motherload of advice and insights. So, thank you again for putting-

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:20:59):
Of course. Very fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:00):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:05):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:06):
First question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:10):
All right, I'll start with A Guide to Midwest Conversation. So, I'm based in Kansas City, I'm a proud Midwesterner, and us Midwesterners talk in a certain way. I think you hear about Minnesota nice, but we tend not to say what we mean, and it is a very funny primer into what Midwesterners actually mean when they say what they say. So, highly recommend reading that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):
I like that you give that to people, just like, here's what I might be telling you, which you may not read.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:38):
My wife is German, and I gave it to her so she could better understand.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):
I see German being the opposite of that, okay.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:21:44):
Very different. Another book, this is a good one, Fate is the Hunter. This is a really cool book, it's a memoir of one of the early commercial airline pilots, and it is wild to hear the stories about what flying was back in the day. I'm a former management consultant, I flew every week for almost six years, and I never once had to worry about, am I going to make it to the other end of this flight alive? That was not the case back then, and so some of the stories about what it used to be like to be a pilot on some of these planes, before modern aviation technology, is fascinating, and makes you really appreciate what we have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):
It feels good to read a book like that, being a software PM or engineer or whatever, how different that life is.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:22:28):
Hardware is hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:28):
Hardware. Oh man, it's not haptic design. Okay. Next, unless there's any other books you're going to share? No, okay, great. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:22:40):
So, I have two kids, I watch a lot of Bluey, it's really good, I swear, it brings me no shortage of joy. But adult show or show not meant for four-year-olds that I have watched, I just finished the latest season of Emily in Paris, man, wonderful. I realize it's not the highest brow of television, but just beautiful people in beautiful cities, solving problems that are not earth-shattering, sometimes it is nice to just tune out. Also, I'm learning French on Duolingo, slight plug for the app, I can understand a lot of the French that is being spoken, and there is no better joy than having invested as much time as I have in French, and actually being able to use it. So, huge fan of Emily.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):
That is so funny, what a fun Venn diagram of interests. My mother-in loves Emily in Paris, I saw someone tweeting about what Visa is she on? How is she still in Paris?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:23:33):
Yeah. You best just not ask questions, there's a lot of questions for this show that are better left unasked.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:40):
[inaudible 01:23:40] Okay. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like? Other than Duolingo.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:23:44):
Last week I went to Home Depot, and I bought a new ladder, and ladder innovations, you don't think of often, but you can make one of the legs go a little bit further than the other leg. And as somebody like myself who has a house that is built on a slight slope, every time I go up on my ladder, I take my life in my hands, but with this ladder, I'm always even. I cleaned my gutters twice last week just because of how awesome this ladder has... How much this ladder has changed my life. So, ladder innovation, I don't think it gets talked enough about and so I'm happy to give it the spotlight it deserves.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:18):
I appreciate you doing that, and it's the first ladder recommendation we've had on the podcast. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you really find useful in work or in life they share with folks?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:24:26):
This probably will not be much of a surprise based on how I've talked about our willingness to test things, but you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm a big fan of just trying things, even if your possibility of success is not 100, because you learn a lot along the way.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:44):
Final question, do you have any fun traditions at Duolingo, amongst either the PM team or the company in general that might be delightful to share?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:24:53):
We have way too many traditions to count. I will share the weird tradition that we do at every retention standup, and this started during the pandemic, we obviously used to stand up in person, and then when we went remote, we did this thing where whoever's the last person to go would count down 3, 2, 1, and then we'd all try to clap at the same time, which was kind of fun and dorky, but we fell in love with it, and four years later we're still doing it. Recently we've added, we all say yee-haw in unison afterwards, I can't tell you why. But trying to synchronize a clap via Zoom, and then all shouting yee-haw... I did this in a phone booth the other day and after I came out someone told me, "You know that those aren't as soundproof as you think," but when you get a good opportunity to give a yee-haw, you can't pass up on it, so.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):
I love these little things, they sound so minor, but they're such important elements of team culture and tradition, and so important for PMs to find ways to just have fun and do something ridiculous.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:25:58):
I will say, it took a while to get people behind shouting yee-haw, but now that we have people doing it, you can't take it away [inaudible 01:26:08], we all love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:09):
Oh man, I called our all hands for a while, y'all hands, feel free to steal that.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:26:14):
You get it, you get it Lenny. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:17):
I get it. Jackson, this is incredible, I feel like people are going to listen to this with notebooks, and just like, okay, here's a bunch of ideas we should try with whatever we're working on, whether it's streaks or not. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Duolingo? I know you're hiring product managers, so share more there, and finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:26:37):
Yes, you can find me on LinkedIn, that is where most of my online social media is, so Jackson Shuttleworth, and then how people can be useful to me, yes, as you said, we are hiring. We're actually hiring for my team. Are you interested in thinking about streaks as much as we do? We might be the right home for you, so please, you can apply on our website. We're also hiring from a number of other product management roles, and they're all as thrilling as this work is.

(01:27:05):
And then, I'm always interested about how other companies have implemented streaks and what they've learned, and so what I'd say is if you're a company who's implemented a streak maybe in a different way than Duolingo has, or you found a whole ton of success and another vector, another element of the feature that we didn't talk about today, I would love to know more. I used to catalog basically every streak I found out there, and as it's become more of a popular feature, it's just been hard to keep up on. So, if you have interesting streak insights to send my way, I would love to hear them.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):
I love that, a collection of all the best ways of doing streaks. Jackson, just I want to say congrats to your team and you for having so much impact. This is like the dream of a lot of PMs and teams, is to see this much impact and continue to ship wins, and so congrats, nice work.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:27:57):
Thank you very much.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:58):
Thanks for [inaudible 01:27:59]. And with that, Jackson, thanks so much for being here.

Jackson Shuttleworth (01:28:02):
Yeah, thank you Lenny, this was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:04):
Same. Bye everyone.

# Building better roadmaps | Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)

## Transcript

Janna Bastow (00:00):
The whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level.

Janna Bastow (00:22):
So at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you'd take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody and say, "Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?" And they'd tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you'd throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you'd make a new one. So the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process.

Janna Bastow (00:47):
The value isn't in your roadmap, the value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, "I think we have this problem, then this problem. What do you think?" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody who will listen and just check that you're on the right path.

Lenny (01:11):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing your own products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Janna Bastow. Janna co-founded Mind the Product, which I believe is the largest community of product people anywhere. She's also the inventor of the roadmapping framework, Now, Next, Later, and the founder of ProdPad, which makes it easy for you to do your roadmapping in this new simpler way. In our chat, we talk about public speaking, community building, roadmapping, vision, and going from product manager to founder. With that, I bring you Janna Bastow.

Lenny (01:58):
This episode is brought to you by Formsort the leading low-code form builder for product teams. If you work at a startup, you've probably experienced the pain of building forms. Product managers come up with an idea for a new onboarding flow, and then engineers have to build it and then maintain these flows forever. Even tiny changes to the flow can take weeks to get implemented, slowing down your team's experimentation cycle. Formsort removes the engineering bottleneck and gives product managers and marketers full control over the form building lifecycle. With Formsort, anyone can build highly customizable forms, implement complex logic, and send data to destinations like Postgres, BigQuery, and Segment.

Lenny (02:38):
Companies like GoodRx, Candid, and Balance Homes build their most important forms on Formsort, think patient intake data, surveys, and fintech onboarding. They've seen conversion rates increase by over 30%, and have saved thousands of engineering hours. I always tell startups that improving onboarding is one of the most powerful ways to optimize activation and increase retention. Formsort makes this process as easy as possible and it's why I'm a proud investor. You can sign up for a free account on formsort.com and use promo code Lenny for 20% off a Formsort Pro plan.

Lenny (03:15):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers. And it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.

Lenny (03:42):
Over the years I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life. With an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda doc gallery, including resources from many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda.Some of the best teams out there like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber, use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use. If you're ping ponging between lots of documents and spreadsheets, make your life better and start using Coda. You can take advantage of a special limited time offer just for startups.

Lenny (04:44):
Janna, welcome to the podcast.

Janna Bastow (04:45):
Hi, thanks so much for having me.

Lenny (04:47):
It's my pleasure. Just to start off and set a little context for folks, could you give listeners a 55 second background on what you've been up to in your career?

Janna Bastow (04:57):
Yeah, absolutely. So I'm a product manager by background. I started my career falling into product management like a lot of people do, accidentally. I worked my way up to be head of product at a startup in London. And then saw the need for product management tools, because there wasn't really anything like that out there. So started building ProdPad. One of my co-founders, who I also happened to start Mind the Product with, and Mind the Product turned into the world's largest community of product managers. So I ended up founding two things at the same time, and that's what kept me busy for the last decade or so.

Lenny (05:28):
And currently you have a company, maybe just mentioned that, before we move on, because I think it'll be important.

Janna Bastow (05:33):
Yep, absolutely. So that tool that I was talking about turned into ProdPad, which is software for product people. So it's a tool that allows you to build roadmaps and do your OKRs and capture ideas from your team and feedback from your customer and just organize all your product managements stuff in one space.

Lenny (05:47):
Awesome. So you mentioned Mind the Product and ProductTank, which is kind of this associated component. I'm not exactly sure the difference, but I know they're related. One's a community component, right? Is that right?

Janna Bastow (05:57):
Yeah.

Lenny (05:57):
Yeah. So I think you mentioned it's probably the biggest product community in the world, both online and offline. And as someone that's building their own community around the newsletter and the podcast that I have, I'm always curious just to learn what folks have learned about building communities, especially for product people. So question on my mind is, what do you think has been most important in getting Mind the Product community right early on, and then also just maintaining the quality of the community?

Janna Bastow (06:23):
Honestly, it wasn't so much that we set out to build a community, it was that we got together with some product people with the idea that we didn't know what we were doing. And so we figured if we got together with some other product people and started chatting it through, we'd all learn together. And so it was just the sense of sharing and collaborating and learning from each other and just keeping it as grassroots as possible as it grew. And consistency as well, just always being there, every month, holding a ProductTank, every year of holding an event. But just being there, whenever there was a chance to be there.

Lenny (06:56):
So I'm hearing is just putting in the time, doing it consistently. I imagine a big part of it was having the right sort of people involved early on that are maybe the right exemplars of the type of community you want to build. Is that roughly right?

Janna Bastow (07:09):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean surround yourself with the people who are going to help you continue that community and are going to help you with that consistency, and going to help you surround you with more and more of the right people. One of the things we learned really early on was that we only had so wide of a network. And so being able to get other people to help us curate and bring in other smart people to help find other speakers outside of our network, and help find people to write on the blog when we'd run out things to rant about. Similar to what you do, Lenny, you've got people from all over your community helping to contribute to the wider picture.

Lenny (07:42):
Awesome. What's the scale of the community at this point?

Janna Bastow (07:45):
That's a good question. I don't have the exact number. What you might not know or what you might know is that Mind the Product was actually sold earlier this year, so I don't have-

Lenny (07:51):
Mm-hmm. I did know that.

Janna Bastow (07:52):
... a handle on the exact numbers now. And it did go influx when COVID hit. I know at one point in time the ProductTank was like 200 going on almost 300 cities around the world. I don't know what that number is today. I know that it sort of went up and then down and then back up again. Some of those are digital still, some of those are back in-person. I know that there's thousands and thousands of product people around the world who are taking part in the community in one way, shape, or form or the other. And, of course, some people take part in the big conferences as well.

Lenny (08:22):
I imagine there were some mistakes that you made along the way building this community.

Janna Bastow (08:26):
Oh God.

Lenny (08:26):
Is there anything that stands out as, "Oh, man, we shouldn't have done that"? For folks that are thinking about building communities these days,

Janna Bastow (08:32):
When running a conference, it's one of the most expensive and unleanest things you can possibly do. It's really difficult as a product person to pull that off, because it pulls at your heart. You want to do something that's lean iterative, but you can't. If something screws up with the lunch order, for example, you can't fix it. You have to wait until the next year and you just have to pull out whatever you can to make it good enough for that particular year. There was a year once when we ordered food and it didn't turn out to be enough, because the caters under delivered, and we ended up having to get all our volunteers to go to the local sandwich shops and buy all the food up and bring it in.It was stuff like that that was difficult at the time, but we made do with what we could and we ended up sending cash cards to our attendee saying, "Here, let's make it up to you." Stuff like that, that just becomes logistically really, really difficult when you're just thinking, "Oh, we just pay a supplier and they make it happen." It's not that simple.

Lenny (09:29):
Got it. Okay. But that's a plus one for me to never run a conference, something I never want to do. And this is a reminder of all the pain that goes into them.

Janna Bastow (09:38):
Conferences are ridiculously hard. I mean the thing that I've learned is when something goes wrong in a conference, it doesn't happen in the hundreds of dollars of cost, it happens in the thousands of dollars of cost. A speaker who decides they can't make it for one reason or the other, totally legitimate reason, sure, but you've already paid for their business class flights, and so you've got to find another speaker last minute and get them over. That's thousands of pounds in the hole. It could be things like the printing went wrong and you found out the day before, that's more dollars gone. There's lots of things that could go wrong. Our venue once went bust, the after party venue once went bust three weeks before the conference. That was year one.

Lenny (10:19):
Super.

Janna Bastow (10:19):
All of these things, yeah, that's what we said, "Super, what are we supposed to do?" We ended up having to just make do and found somewhere else and roll with it. So lots of things that go wrong at that sort of level. But the thing is that we built up a lot of goodwill with the community and were able to get help from people around us, get suggestions from people around us. And when things ended up, actually it turns out we ended up with a smaller venue than we expected, or this was slightly different or whatever else, we had people forgive us. It worked out okay, in our favor.

Lenny (10:49):
Just while on this topic, I'm most curious, are conferences like a good business? Do they make a ton of money in some occasions? Is it always just super thin margin? How does that even business work?

Janna Bastow (10:59):
It's not for the faint hearted. It's hugely risky. In hindsight, I'm highly surprised we actually made it through some of those first ones. If you can do it, there are some amazing ways that you can monetize them. But it only starts making a difference at larger figures, and it takes a lot of efforts to actually get to that point. Somebody once asked me like, "Oh, we're struggling to sell tickets. How do you sell all those tickets?" We'll start a community several years before and invite people and run a thing, some sort of community meetup every month time, time again beforehand, and that's your marketing.

Janna Bastow (11:33):
Just if you undersell tickets to a conference, for example, it can absolutely break it. And you see sometimes conferences, they run one and they don't have enough people turning up and it's gone. That can just break it. It's ridiculous. Something like COVID comes by and it can break it. It's a ridiculously hard business. It's really hard to ensure against. It's really hard to think of all the things that could go wrong and protect against. So while there are some upsides, it's not for the faint hearted.

Lenny (12:01):
Okay, cool. That's another plus one. I have a friend who runs events here in San Francisco and I'm always just like, "How can someone be excited about running events over and over? It's so stressful and full of risk and there's always things going wrong. You can't ever have fun at these things." So it's always a different personality.

Janna Bastow (12:16):
Yeah, event organizer or event manager or something like that was once listed as one of the most stressful jobs out there. And you can see why. It's because it all just lands on you all at once. And once the event is over, there's the sense of [foreign language 00:12:29], as in it's over and now what? The next day you're just like, "Yay." You can look at the tweet stream of everything that happened. You can look back at the photos and then you're like, "What do we do next?"

Lenny (12:38):
Start prepping for ext year.

Janna Bastow (12:39):
You start prepping for next year, off we go again. And it's really hard work. But there again, product management was also listed as one of the toughest jobs, one of the hardest jobs out there. I'm not sure if that still stands, but I know product management as it stood 10 years ago, five, 10 years ago, certainly did have a different vibe to it, and it was a really tough job.

Lenny (12:58):
Continues to be a very tough job. On the topic of conferences and speaking, I've watched a bunch of your talks online before we started chatting today. And a couple things I noticed. One is you're just an awesome speaker, and you're also storyteller. And something that comes up a lot on this podcast is just how important communication skills are to product leaders and product managers and storytelling. And you've also seen a bunch of people do awesome talks at these conferences. So I'm just curious, whatever you have in mind, what has helped you become a better speaker and storyteller? And then also what have you seen is important to folks that are really good at storytelling and presenting at a conference, let's say?

Janna Bastow (13:37):
Right. Yeah, such a good question. I mean, I have learned by watching a lot of other people. One of the things that I have been super lucky in my career is that by being part of Mind the Product I've gotten to watch every last Mind the Product speaker, top end speakers. I've been able to see every ProductTank London speaker, and a lot of the other ProductTank speakers around the world. Been able to see what people react to, what works, what doesn't work. So I've been able to develop a taste for a good talk and a good presentation and that sort of thing.

Janna Bastow (14:06):
But also one of the things that Mind the Product has been able to provide to speakers is a speaker coach. So when I was invited to speak on the Mind the Product stage in 2017, one of the things that they provided to me was an actual speaker coach, somebody to take my talk and improve on it. And it was really nerve-wracking taking my half-written talk, which I started months and months before, it started off with just Post-It Notes scattered along the wall, which I tried to turn into something. And I think it was probably six hours worth of content. And I brought this to this speaker coach, and I had a vague script idea of what I wanted to say.

Janna Bastow (14:43):
And she said to me, one of the first things, she said, "Well, I've taken your script and I've turned it around. I've rewritten the jokes to land a little bit better." I was like, "That's great. I had jokes." And she helped turn the stories around, so that they carried through. She helped with posture. She helped with delivery. She helped with even just phrasing of words. Just making sure that everything landed in particular ways. And one of the things she did was make me listen to it and play it back, which I had not done before. And I still hate doing to this day, but am now more used to it than before.And I don't think anybody likes listening to the sound of their own voice. I don't think anybody likes doing that. But it does help with it. If you've got a large presentation, a big presentation, you've got to get up to that level. If you're nervous about doing it in front of a 1,000 people, then getting to that level that you're actually willing to, able to hear yourself do it, and you're able to do the talk flawlessly in the shower, and as you're walking to work, and as you're doing your groceries and all that sort of stuff, then it makes a big difference.

Lenny (15:47):
So one tactic that I love that you shared is record yourself, watch yourself ,keep refining, but watching your actual performance. Looking back at the lessons your coach taught you for new presentations that you do, is there anything else that sticks with you? Or just let's make sure to get X, Y, Z nailed because that'll help make this talk better.

Janna Bastow (16:06):
One of the things that I've stopped doing is I used to sit down with a PowerPoint and start writing my deck in PowerPoint or Slides, now. What I now do is I start with my story points. I start with my narratives. I try to figure out what I'm actually trying to say, and then I fit it into the deck. Because what I was doing before, I would get stuck in this mode of the presentation mode, and trying to make the presentation, the slides fit my narrative as opposed to the opposite way around. Having a great narrative, and the slides should follow more naturally.

Lenny (16:43):
What about just the presenting, the physical anxiety of presenting?, Is there anything you've done there to get better with that and feel-

Janna Bastow (16:51):
Oh, yes.

Lenny (16:51):
... more comfortable?

Janna Bastow (16:51):
So one of the things that actually really does work is the power pose, standing with your hands on your hips and it really does, I'm not sure if it's adrenaline or endorphins or something, it releases some sort of chemicals that really does just help boost your confidence and make you feel better as you're getting ready to stand on stage. And it something that's me and other Mind the Product speakers, and I've done behind all the big stages that I've done in recent years. Stand there with your hands on your hips and just feel better about it as opposed to sitting there balling up in that tense pile of stress.

Janna Bastow (17:25):
One of the other things that I always do, if I get a chance to, is get out onto the stage sooner rather later. So when they do the tech check, just walk out onto the stage and just wonder back and forth and look out to the audience and greet it. There's no one there. It's the day before, it's completely empty. But look up at the audience and just enjoy that sweep of the audience, and just get used to it. And imagine it full of people. Don't imagine them naked, that doesn't matter. But just imagine them there, so that when you actually do see them the next day, it's not so stressful.

Janna Bastow (17:56):
One of the other things I try to do is find the people in the audience who are your fans. And you'll find them in the course of your talk. There's always going to be some people in the audience who just look bored and they're on your phone, just ignore them. They're always going to be there. Find the people who are nodding along and smiling and going, "Yeah, yeah, that's me. That's me." And just speak to them. And if you find one up there and one over there and one down there, no one's going to notice that you're doing your talk just to them. And just keep delivering your talk around the room to these few key people. They're having a great time, you're having a great time, and you're doing a great talk as a result.

Lenny (18:30):
That's such good advice. The power pose piece, you said that it's hands on hips. I think there's also when we raise your hands up and you're like Superman or something. I think there's-

Janna Bastow (18:38):
That could work, yeah.

Lenny (18:38):
Yeah. I think people have different ones. Also, I've seen that, there's like all the science that showed that was effective and then I think it was one of those experiments that wasn't replicatable. People are kind of worried that there's not real science backing that up. But I've done that myself and it actually works. And so it doesn't matter ,if it works for you, just do it.

Janna Bastow (18:57):
Yeah. If it's a placebo, hey, don't tell me that, it works. Honestly, I feel better at the end of it, and get on stage and do a better job.

Lenny (19:05):
Someone made this point, placebo is this magical thing that we have in our brains that gets things to change by not having anything go. You just change things. It's amazing. It's magical.

Janna Bastow (19:15):
Yeah. Placebos are as effective as the actual drug, whatever. I'm happy with a placebo. Just don't break the placebo effect for me. That would be fine, right?

Lenny (19:23):
Yeah. That's right. One last question on the speaking stuff. How bad were you initially? Just because folks probably see you, see some of your talks and they're like, "Oh, my god, I'm never going to be this good. I'm screwed."

Janna Bastow (19:34):
Yeah, I used to be shaky, little fawn, shaky voice, terrified at the front. Okay. So it was one of the first ever ProductCamp events that we were running. And the first one I think I did okay at, but it was a smaller group, it who's only like 50 or so people. And the second one it had ballooned to 200 people. This is more product people than I'd ever known. And they were all super professional, and they're all looking at me. And I stood at the front of this group and I was supposed to just, I don't know, tell them what they were supposed to be doing that day. And I had it all half written down, and I started talking and then I sort just tripped up over what I was saying and forgot everything and blanked. And I just looked up and I went, "I'm really sorry everybody. I'm just going to start again."

Janna Bastow (20:19):
And I started again. I said, "Hi everybody, I'm Janna and welcome to ProductCamp." And I just started again and they were just totally fine with it. Honestly, it was fine. And this is the thing that I've learned since then is people in the audience are rooting for you. They were totally cool with this. They didn't think anything of it and they just rolled with it, as did I. And so whenever I see somebody who's struggling on stage, just give them a nod, a smile, clap them along, give them reassuring looks, and hopefully they'll just pull through.

Janna Bastow (20:48):
And if you ever feel like you're shaking, you're corpsing on stage, you're falling apart, honestly, just take a deep breath and just pick up where you last remembered you were and just keep going. Honestly, no one is rooting for you to fall over and have a bad time. Everyone's rooting for you to finish your point and get on with it.

Lenny (21:05):
That's such a great story and it's a good example of people have this fear of the worst case scenario. Everything's going to fall apart. They're going to be seen as idiots, they don't know what they're doing. It's all going to be revealed on stage, because you screw up in how you're talking. And the worst case scenario never happens, in my experience. And two,, if it does, just do exactly what you said, just try to start again. It's easy to say, hard to do. This isn't a conscious thing that people can get over. It's like your body's just doing crazy shit and you're so nervous sometimes and can't just rationalize it to like, "Nah, it'll be fine." But, yeah, it's fine. To your point, people want you to be awesome and succeed. They're not there to like, "Ha, ha, you stopped. You screwed up."

Janna Bastow (21:47):
And it's humanizing when you screw up, right? People don't like people who are perfectly perfect and don't mess up, and it makes them feel like they can't go up and go do their talk. I mean I think that right there showed everybody else that they could go up on the little ProductCamp stages that day and go do their own talks. And they certainly wouldn't be any worse than that. As long as I just remembered their name, they'd be fine. Crack on, they got it.

Lenny (22:12):
Speaking of screwing up, you have some very spicy takes on roadmap and roadmaps.

Janna Bastow (22:16):
Ooh, yes, I do.

Lenny (22:20):
And then generally the mistakes people make in organizing the roadmap. So I definitely want to spend some time here. So first of all, you have some strong feelings against Gantt based road mapping. Can you talk about that?

Janna Bastow (22:31):
Yeah, sure. I used to do timeline roadmapping. The first version of ProdPad was actually a timeline roadmap. So to take you back, when I was a junior product manager, mid-level product manager, I used to do my roadmap like everyone else was doing the road, as in I looked up what a roadmap was, and it looked like a colorful Gantt chart. I knew what a Gantt chart was. And so I started putting one together, which is where I'd take the features that I was working on and line them up against their due dates. And I would get a little pat on the head from my boss, and they'd say, "Good job, now go deliver it," basically.

Janna Bastow (23:05):
And I would do my best with delivery, and I'd never quite be able to deliver everything. Something would always get in the way. But I sort of assumed that was my fault. I just wasn't great at delivery, and I just had to get a little bit better at adding enough buffer and setting expectations and doing a roadmap slightly better. But I figured that this is how everyone was doing the roadmaps, and it was just me who wasn't finishing the stuff on the roadmap quite right.

Janna Bastow (23:29):
And when it came to creating the first tools for roadmap, I'd envision something that would actually help me manage this format of a roadmap more easily. Which I ended up creating the very early version of ProdPad, which was a digitized version of this, where you could drag and drop ideas onto the roadmap and stretch and squeeze them, and pan the roadmap back and forth. And I shared this with some early product people that I knew, some early users, and they gave me some feedback and some of them absolutely loved it.

Janna Bastow (23:56):
They're like, "Yeah, this is great. Now I can stop using PowerPoints or whatever tool I'm using or drawing it up in whatever I can now start using this digitized tool." But one of the things that we started hearing from early customers is about a month later they said, "Great, but I want to take this, and move all these things here over by a month in the field." We're like, "Oh, that's interesting. We've heard that from a bunch of other people too. Now why is that?" Because had we just asked our customers, had we just built what our customers wanted, we would've just ended up with a multi-select drag and drop. But this was all built in jQuery and it was a little bit difficult to build that.

Janna Bastow (24:35):
So we sort of asked the five whys, we dug in to why people wanted this thing, and we found out that no one was actually delivering the roadmap in the timeframe that they were saying they were. So we're like, "Wait, if it's not just us who's not living the roadmap and none of these better than us roadmap product managers are building the roadmap on time, what's the point of a roadmap? Why are we giving them a roadmap?" So that's when we sat down, it was myself and Simon, my co-founder at ProdPad, and we sat down and we came up with a three column roadmap, current, near term, future, which became now, next, later.

Janna Bastow (25:08):
And it took away the simple concept of a timeline at the top. Now, the problem with the timeline is that as soon as you have a timeline, it turns it into a math chart sort of thing, where you've got time on the X axis and things to do on the Y axis and you basically end up with everything underneath is assigned a due date or a iteration. And it seems that everything that you do has a due date, an iteration just by the format of the roadmap, which is painful. It's just wrong, because we don't have that. The further out you plan, the more you're making it up. We know this.

Janna Bastow (25:45):
And so we wanted more flexibility and we knew that other product managers wanted that flexibility, because we kept asking what they were up to. So we decided to break it down into these three buckets, and provided that as an option and people loved it. It became this first bump in our usage of ProdPad, because people went, "Oh, wait, I can just say what's happening now, what's happening next, and what's happening later? And if I want to, I can add a date to the specific thing, but I don't have to. And I can be less and less granular about that as I go forwards. Yeah."

Janna Bastow (26:18):
So it's taking from the concept of the cone of uncertainty, taking from the idea that things get less certain as they get further away, which is kind of how reality works. So the whole beef with the timeline roadmap is just taking apart the concept of the timeline. It doesn't mean we live in la la land. It doesn't mean that we don't believe in having dates on the roadmap, if there is a date that we have to work towards. It just means not penalizing ourselves by having a date on everything on the roadmap.

Lenny (26:49):
Got it. Okay. I didn't know that you could put dates on some of the things that's interesting, because I was trying to understand exactly how this approach works. We should also mentioned, you came up with this whole idea of now, next, later, which a lot of people use now. Is that right?

Janna Bastow (27:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (27:02):
Awesome. Okay. So as someone that's been using Gantt timelines his whole career, I'm really curious to dig into these ideas and challenge the default assumption.

Lenny (27:12):
I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (27:17):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (27:18):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation, and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (27:30):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (27:51):
And supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (27:55):
Yeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates, and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growing.

Lenny (28:04):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John. And head to amplitude.com to get started.

Lenny (28:09):
There's two questions that this brings up, and you may have answered them in part. One is just without dates on things, how do you make sure marketing and sales and your CEO has things that they need for promising or at least giving a sense of when a product will come out? And the other is just aligning internally with engineers, design being done on a certain date, engineers being done on a certain date, PMs being done a certain day, [inaudible 00:28:32]. How do you deal with those in this format?

Janna Bastow (28:36):
There's a couple ways that you can turn that around. So one is you should still be having regular communication, so they can still see what's coming up in the now call them. So they have a sense of what the order of things are and that things that are in the now column are probably weeks away, not months and months away. You should probably have launch readiness meetings so people understand this is the stuff that's going through testing, and that's likely to be coming out now.

Janna Bastow (28:59):
But one of the other things that you can be doing for your marketing and sales teams is separating your hard launch from your soft launch. So what you should be doing is basically saying your developers are able to launch something on a particular date and it's the date that's convenient for them, right? Let's say they think that they can get something out for end of September. Now, that might be pushed to made October because things go wrong.

Janna Bastow (29:23):
Now at that point, whether it's end of September or mid-October, it doesn't really matter to the marketers because they're busy talking about the stuff that was launched in August. They've got lots of stuff to work on. They're selling and marketing the stuff that's already live and out there. When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps. Now you've got something else to go do. And it's so much better for marketing anyways because they're not setting up their launch steps based on something that they don't have eyes on. There's nothing worse than the marketers trying to market something based on pictures from the designers that have vastly changed by the time they go out or that they don't know whether it's going to come out on the right day or not.

Janna Bastow (30:07):
So they've actually got a functional working version that they can share with some customers. They can start getting videos of it working. They can get testimonials from early beta users. And then they can spend, whether it's two days or six days or six weeks or six months planning the biggest, bangest launch they want. They can then spend the next however long they want to launch their hard launch, and then that goes out. And in that period that they're doing that hard launch development is cracking on with their next thing.

Janna Bastow (30:41):
And by the time that they're done that marketing is then, "Okay, great, what have you built? We're ready to work on the next thing." So you're just separating soft launch from hard launch, so that you don't have this stress of trying to line up to completely different types of projects, your marketing projects and your development projects, which is where a lot of those things fall apart.

Lenny (31:00):
Got it. So kind of the basic premise is roadmaps or timelines sound great and awesome. Everyone would love to know when things are going to be done and if it worked it'd be great. Oftentimes, they're all made up, they don't work, you don't hit deadlines, they're always missed. So instead of promising dates for everything you're doing, you're better off generally just giving a sense of, "Here's what we're going to work on now. Here's what's coming up next." And then for the things that really need a date, we're going to put dates on those things and give it our best shot. Is that [inaudible 00:31:29]-

Janna Bastow (31:29):
Yeah. That's absolutely right. If something does have to have a date, we don't live in la la land, if something has a regulatory date, when GDPR came down, everyone had a due date on the roadmap, because if you didn't hit that date then you were going to be in trouble. Sometimes you might have dates that are tied to things like the Christmas rush, or if you're in education it might be like has to be out by the school year.

Janna Bastow (31:50):
At which point, in order to reach something by that date you have to put in more project planning work, as in you have to plan out ahead of time, you have to put in more buffer time to do that. And generally you have to plan to get that thing done well before, so that you can have a soft launch before and make sure it works and do some iteration and fix it before the actual full-on launch happens. Because if you leave it too late, it's going to go wrong and you're going to miss the deadline.

Janna Bastow (32:16):
If you did that for all of your launches, you're just going to end up either cutting quality, because everything's just going to be big crap cause it's going to be pushing it out the door last minute. Or you're just going to end up spending so much time trying to plan things to the nth degree that you're just going to move super slow. This is why you end up with teams who are really big but can't deliver worth anything. Where compared to these tiny teams, who are just out delivering them and just spinning things out the door, they're the ones who aren't spending all their time going, "Are we certain this is going to deliver? And how many hours is this going to take you? And let me go talk to this person, find out how many days it's going to take him," and back and forth and back and forth. They're just building, and it goes faster.

Lenny (32:57):
I'd love to pull on that thread. I was thinking about the fact that you're building software for product teams and so you have a really unique perspective on product teams and you've seen a lot of product teams a lot more than a lot of other folks. And so I was curious what percentage of teams that you see are what you'd call like top notch, highly functional product teams?

Janna Bastow (33:18):
That's a good question. I don't think I've got an answer there because it's going to be biased, because we naturally attract companies who self-select our way of working. We put on our site, no timelines come for the now, next, later. So it's going to be a much higher percentage. People don't sign up for demos with us if they know that they want a timeline nowadays, because we make it really clear. So I would say like 70% of them are like we want now, next, later. And I know that's not real. I know that's not the real state of people, of product teams out there.

Lenny (33:48):
Cool. So yeah, that makes sense.

Janna Bastow (33:49):
I do have a sense that it's increasing. So what I have found is years ago when we first started this thing off, no one was talking this way. It was a whole new concept and people are like, "No, this is crazy doc, you can't do it this way." Then over the years it has just become the natural way that people are working on it. People are going, "Of course this is the way that it works. Why would it work any other way?" It's becoming the expected way. Definitely changed the discourse and changed the expectations of the audience, I guess.

Lenny (34:13):
Putting the now next later piece to the site for one moment. I'm curious what else have you seen separates the best product teams from mediocre product teams? In terms of how they execute, the people they hire, processes, is there anything else that you've noticed of just like this team, when I think of teams that are functioning super well? Other than implementing this process you're recommending, is there anything else that often comes up?

Janna Bastow (34:37):
Yeah, a couple things. A focus on discovery. So this ability to spend time in discovery and asking questions of customers and constantly being able to iterate based on that. And psychological safety, so teams who are able to question each other, speak up when they see that things are wrong, question what's going on at the senior level, question what's going on at different team levels, and generally just have the good sense of what's going on across their business because they're allowed to ask those questions, less silos.

Lenny (35:05):
Thanks. What's a lasting change that a team has made that made them significantly better at building product? Is it these two things, doing more discovery and maybe more safety? I imagine part of your answer will be implementing this way of working of now, next, later. Is there anything else that comes to mind? "Wow, wow, this one team did this one thing and it made things so much better for them."

Janna Bastow (35:24):
Like retrospectives. Retrospectives make such a big difference because they are indicative of psychological safety, which underpins so much, right? Once you start building in this psychological safety, the ability to ask questions and to start saying, "What are we doing that's working? What are we doing that's not working? Okay, determine that something doesn't work. Are we allowed to go change it? Okay, we are allowed to go change it." Okay, this is a team who's now changing their situation. They're talking to each other, they're learning from each other, and they're making a concerted effort to do so. And so these are the teams who are constantly learning, iterating, and moving forwards.

Janna Bastow (36:03):
And they naturally move towards things like now, next, later. They naturally move towards things like doing discovery, because these are just, I don't know, they're kind of common sense. They're not setting in stone expectations of what's going to be done and when. Because that was really only done because some head honcho wanted to see that information. That wasn't psychological safety. That was somebody pinning them down by the neck saying, "Tell me what's going to be done and when." Psychological safety is just saying, "Hey, tell me as much information as you know and then do discovery to learn as much as you can, so that we can move forward with this." It's all about just talking to your teammates and getting the most information as you can from the resources you have, making the most of the collective intelligence that you have within your company.

Lenny (36:46):
Coming back to the now, next, later approach, you're often doing something really hard at companies, which is changing their way of working and changing their product culture. And I'm curious what you've learned about what it takes to change product development culture and product culture and the way of working at larger companies.

Janna Bastow (37:04):
Larger companies are tough. They're tougher. I think of culture as calcification. So calcification being the limestone that is built up as watered run over and that sort of thing. And in order to fix it, you can kind of chip it off over time. You can't just fix it all in one go. And so in order to fix it, you've got to chip away at it. You've got to find a small pocket somewhere. You've got to make use of the tools that you've got. So sometimes it might be finding a small subset of the company and saying, 'Hey, here's the startup lab within the business. Let's let them run off and go do something." Because changing the mindset of the whole company is just too difficult. It's set in stone, and it's stuck where it is and can't change them all at once. But we can change this one little space right here, because we've got a shit hot leader who knows what they're doing and we can take this pocket of people and go do something here.

Janna Bastow (38:00):
And then they're going to teach the rest of the company. They're going to teach this section and then this section and then this section. You don't have to go and change the whole company all at once, but it does take buy-in from above. And sometimes that can be really difficult to take, because the incentives from above are often misaligned with the incentives that it takes to get a company moving this direction.

Janna Bastow (38:21):
Ultimately, a lot of these larger companies, they're incentivized to keep the company as stable as possible, to keep the company just growing quarter on quarter. Which is great for the stock market, they love that stability, they love that quarter on quarter growth. But if the company is actually under threat from startups, if you're a big bank, you're in health tech, something like that, you almost certainly have startups nipping at your heels. And the reality is that you probably have enough cash to make it for the next 20 years or so, but over time it's going to get bitten away at.

Janna Bastow (38:58):
And you've got smaller startups who are going to take the juicier, more interesting parts of your business and leave you with the tougher parts of your business. Take HSBC versus all the companies who are coming out with got a Starling account here and I've got a mortgage with somebody else and you've got your savings account somewhere else. You've got all these smaller startups nipping at their heels. These companies are going to nip away at these larger businesses and if these larger companies don't actually do something with it, they're actually going to end up losing this ability to innovate themselves. And so these companies are essentially stuck in this pattern where they want to continue growing and yet they're not going to, they're going to end up not being willing to take the dip to move upwards.

Lenny (39:42):
What's the biggest company that you've implemented this new way of building? And is that how you approached it, you found a team within the larger company to roll out this new-

Janna Bastow (39:53):
Yes.

Lenny (39:53):
... yeah, this framework?

Janna Bastow (39:54):
Yeah. So that's how it generally works with the way that we work with our enterprise rollouts is like we worked with large enterprises of governments as well. It generally starts with an advocate, somebody who gets the way that we're working, a division, a department, and then it starts from there. Sometimes what we'll find is that we'll get one or two, sometimes three or four many groups starting and then they'll start banding together and saying, "Hey, no, we're starting a thing here." Once that starts happening, it's easier to start that conversation saying, "Okay, yeah, we've got a whole thing going here. Let's talk to the person who is the VP of strategy, or who owns the tech area," and then we can have a bigger conversation.

Lenny (40:33):
What's the impact that you saw at that company having taken on this new way of building product?

Janna Bastow (40:39):
So we're in the middle of a key tool in the middle of transformations right now, which is fascinating to see. These are multi-year pieces of work where you're seeing it being used for ongoing products that are being used and delivered as we speak, as well as part of a mindset shift within the business. Because one of the things about ProdPad is that it's not just a tool to help you deliver your products, it's actually a tool that helps you become a better product manager. It sets in stone better product management practices. Once you start using it, it makes it difficult to go back to bad product management practices.

Janna Bastow (41:15):
When you create a roadmap in ProdPad, it makes difficult to add features and dates to the roadmap. It makes it difficult to make a timeline based roadmap. It makes it difficult to add ideas to the backlog that are not thought through, because it asks questions, thoughtful questions, like what problem does this solve? And why would you want to solve it? And what are the outcomes? And what did you get?So it makes it difficult to fall into a build trap with just saying, "Here's stuff to build," and we built it, and move on to the next thing, like a lot of dev tools are designed to do. Because it has spaces in there to say, "Did you measure success? And was it successful or not successful? This roadmap thing is completed, what was the outcome of it?" So by creating all these spaces, it creates all these reminders for the team to go back and think about this stuff before they do work and after they do work. So it actually actively helps them become better product teams and more cognizant of this sort of work.

Lenny (42:05):
If someone wanted to experiment with now, next, later, what would be a good place to go and just start to play around with it?

Janna Bastow (42:12):
I mean, you can start a free trial in ProdPad, you can start playing around with it. We even have a sandbox mode. You just go to sandbox.prodpad.com where it's got example versions of roadmaps, best practice roadmaps that you can just start playing with. You don't even need a login or a credit card. It's got OKRs and roadmaps and ideas and experiments, feedback. You see how it all sort of fits together. But honestly, a now, next, later roadmap can be done with Post-It Notes on the wall. It's just about saying, "What problems do you have? Let's lay them out in order and just check them with other people."

Janna Bastow (42:45):
So the whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level. So at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody, and say, "Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?" And they tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you make a new one.

Janna Bastow (43:27):
So the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process. The value isn't in your roadmap, The value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, "I think we have this problem then this problem. What do you think?" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody, who will listen. And just check that you're on the right path. And if they say, "Oh, actually I thought that it was going to go this way, this way, then this way, or that way, then the other way, and what about this problem?" You've actually learned something. You can adjust your prototype for your strategy, you can adjust your roadmap there and your roadmap all of a sudden becomes stronger, becomes better there.

Lenny (44:11):
For folks that are listening and they're just like, "Nah, this is never going to work where I work. It's just too out there, too radical. No deadlines, that's crazy." I know you're not saying no deadlines, but less deadlines. What are the most powerful three bullet points you could share with listeners that are just like, :Here's why you should have confidence this might actually work at your company."

Janna Bastow (44:32):
Other teams are already working this way. Product people are the only ones who seem to be pinned down to be required to give concrete dates as to when things are going to be delivered in this way. Your sales team isn't asked to give exact delivery dates on their work. They work in a very experimentation led way as well. You are VP sales or VP revenue or whoever doesn't go to a board meeting and say, "We're going to close the Acme deal at the end of October for a million pounds." They don't know that. What they do know is that they have a process by which they're going to fill a pipeline, and almost certainly they're going to be able to close a million pounds or a million dollars worth of sales, but they can't tell you who it's going to come from or how that's going to work.

Janna Bastow (45:19):
What they're going to say is, "Give me a quarter million dollars worth of investment into my team, which I'm going to spend that on my account executives, my sales team. They're going to pick up the phone and do a bunch of calls." Think of these calls as experiments. These calls, some of them are going to work, some of them are going to fail. They don't know which ones are going to work and which ones are going to fail. What they do know is that by using a script and by picking up the phone and calling people, some are going to work. And by the end of the quarter someone's going to buy. And they know this because last quarter someone bought and the quarter before that someone bought, they just don't know who's going to buy. If they did know who's going to buy, then they would just call those people and not everybody else.

Janna Bastow (45:59):
Same thing. You're not asking for any more leeway than your sales team. You're saying that you want a quarter million dollars worth of investment, and you're going to spend it on your team who's going to run experiments, right? It's going to be trying this change on the interface or that tweak to the pricing or that change to the positioning or whatever you're going to do. Some of these experiments are going to fail and some are going to succeed. You don't know which ones. But that's okay, you know that by the end of the quarter, enough are going to succeed that you're probably going to move the right numbers in the right direction.

Janna Bastow (46:30):
So you're not asking for any more leeway than your salesperson. What you should be able to do is point at how many experiments you ran the previous quarter, and what numbers moved in the right direction. You should be accountable for your experiments and how you're spending the money and what you're doing. But you shouldn't be accountable for saying what is going to work before you know what's going to work yet. And that's the problem with this timeline delivery, Magic 8 Ball that we're asked to give.

Lenny (46:58):
I like that. Two last questions before we get to a very exciting lightning round, which I didn't tell you about. We'll see how that goes. So one is you have an interesting framework for coming up with a product vision, and I don't know if you have this in your head loaded up, but I'm curious how you think about coming up with a product vision. You have this really handy little framework, and vision is always this thing that people are like, "Man, how do I come up with a vision? How do I phrase a vision? How do I even visualize my team's mission?" Can you share that with us, if you have that in your head?

Janna Bastow (47:30):
The product vision template, you might actually recognize it from the Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm book. It's the elevator pitch template. But I like it because it answers the same sort of questions that you need to answer for a product vision template. So it asks things like, for your target customer, who the statement of need or the opportunity. The product name is a product category. What's the reason to buy? And then say, unlike this alternative our product, and then say what this statement of differentiation is. So it's actually a template that we have available on our site, and you can actually fill out as part of our product canvas in ProdPad. So happy to share that link with you, so you can link it up and send it to your audience here, Lenny.

Lenny (48:17):
Cool. Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes. I think that's the same framework as the positioning exercise. I might be wrong, but if so, that's cool. So basically you could use your positioning work to help figure out your vision. And just like a vision, it's basically a vision statement, it's not necessarily the vision for your product, it's just kind of how you think about where it's going to go.

Janna Bastow (48:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (48:36):
Okay, cool. The last question, you were a PM now you're founder, so you moved from PM to founder, and a lot of PMs, imagine being founders someday. I'm curious if you have any advice for folks that are currently PMs that may want to be founders in the future. What do you think they should be working on, focusing on, skills, vision rebuilding, things they should be doing to help them in that future career?

Janna Bastow (48:58):
Being a PM actually provides you with a lot of the skills and background to be a founder, to be a CEO. It gives you a lot of chance to work with a lot of the different teams and see a lot of the underpinnings of how business works. I was really lucky in previous roles where I got to work very closely with leadership in a few different roles before I took the step up to take on my own thing. So I felt as if I'd seen it in a few different ways, done well and done badly, and so I got a chance to sort of say, "Ah, I think I could do this. Yeah, go on."

Janna Bastow (49:32):
One of the things that struck me is it's not as hard as it looks, and it's also harder than it looks. There's things that you get started and you go, oh, no one's going to stop you from doing this. You've got lots of leeway. You can just do it, and you've got lots of freedom to run your business how you want to do it. There's lots of resource out there. As long as you surround yourself with people, you're always going to be able to find people to advise you and to help you along the way. And there's always going to be bumps. You don't know what they're going to be yet. There's always going to be things that are going to come by and side swipe you, but that's always the case that you had when you are product manager as well.

Janna Bastow (50:11):
And just be ready for those and be ready to take it on the chin and deal with them as they come. Best thing you can do is surround yourself with people so that you've got somebody to go to for each thing. Going, "Oh, when I run into a problem that has to do with this, I can talk to this person. When I run into a problem that has to do with this, I talked to one of these people." And figure it out as you go. Take each thing a day at time. Certainly, don't stop yourself from starting a business or starting your own thing, just because you don't think that you know how to do it yet. You will figure it out as you go ahead. People less capable than you have figured it out.

Lenny (50:46):
Awesome. Okay. We've reached our lightning round. The way it's going to work, I'm going to ask you five questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, share an answer.

Janna Bastow (50:55):
Cool.

Lenny (50:56):
If nothing comes to mind, that's also cool. Sound good?

Janna Bastow (50:58):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (50:59):
What are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people, whether they're product leaders or just generally?

Janna Bastow (51:06):
Art of Profitability, I thought was a really good one.

Lenny (51:09):
What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you've watched?

Janna Bastow (51:13):
Oh, Sandman.

Lenny (51:14):
Ooh, and that's-

Janna Bastow (51:16):
Sandman is-

Lenny (51:16):
... like a British show, right?

Janna Bastow (51:17):
Oh, it is British. Yes, by Neil Gaiman. Yeah, very good. Definitely, not for children. Thought it might be, definitely not.

Lenny (51:25):
Noted. What's another favorite podcast of yours other than the one you're currently on?

Janna Bastow (51:31):
Ooh, Startups For the Rest Of Us.

Lenny (51:33):
Wow, I haven't heard of that one. Tell us more.

Janna Bastow (51:36):
Basically, it's Rob Walling's podcast and it's for startups that are either bootstrapped or alt funded. Basically, the startups that aren't the one percent top end funded, unicorns, but the startups for the rest of us.

Lenny (51:52):
Awesome. What's a favorite interview question of yours that you like to ask?

Janna Bastow (51:57):
I like asking people what problems that they're looking to solve. Why are they coming to this table?

Lenny (52:03):
Very PMy question.

Janna Bastow (52:05):
Yes.

Lenny (52:05):
Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader? Who comes to mind?

Janna Bastow (52:10):
I've got to give a shout out to Christina Wodtke. I had a great conversation with her yesterday, and I've had a chance to chat with her a number of times over the years, but she's just got this illustrious career. She's been part of so many amazing teams, built some amazing things, written some amazing books, and is also just an all round amazing product person and amazing person all in one.

Lenny (52:32):
Janna, this has been amazing. I think we covered a lot of different topics, more than we often cover in a podcast like this. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they'd like to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Janna Bastow (52:45):
Wonderful. Hi, I'm Janna Bastow. You can find me all on Twitter, I'm simplybastow there. Or come find me on LinkedIn, connect with me, I'm Janna Bastow. I'm easy to find there.

# How to get press for your product | Jason Feifer (editor in chief of Entrepreneur magazine)

## Transcript

Jason Feifer (00:00:00):
The editor, the writer, I'll just say it as plainly as possible. They don't care about you. They don't care about you. They care about their reader or their listener or their viewer. That's who they care about. That's who they're serving, and if you can be of use to them in sharing the kinds of information that they are looking to serve their audience, then you can get what you want. But you can't treat them like a service provider because they're not. And so you have to approach them with an understanding of what they're trying to do for their audience and how you can fit into that because if you don't, they are not interested in you.

Lenny (00:00:47):
Today, my guest is Jason Feifer. Jason is editor in chief at Entrepreneur Magazine, previously an editor at Fast Company and a number of other magazines. He's also an author, podcast host, keynote speaker, and startup advisor. In our conversation, we get incredibly tactical about how to get press for your product. Jason shares how to pitch a journalist, how to find the right journalist to pitch, what publications to consider, why freelance writers are more likely to write about your story, why the mission of the publication is so important in how you pitch them, plus what channels to use to reach out to journalists, how to think about your goals and what success looks like from getting press, so much more.

(00:01:25):
I learned a ton from this conversation, and if you're looking to get press for your stuff, you'll find so much value here. With that, I bring you Jason Feifer after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group.

(00:02:05):
With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together, we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today?

(00:02:46):
Jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Maui Nui Venison, a mission-based food company, bringing the healthiest red meat on the planet directly to your door. I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year after hearing their app on the Tim Ferriss Podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient-dense and protein-dense red meat available, their operation produces the only stress-free 100% wild harvested red meat on the market that is the only one of its kind in the world, actively managing Maui's invasive access, deer populations, helping to restore balanced, vulnerable ecosystems, food systems and communities in Hawaii.

(00:03:33):
Also, it is seriously delicious. Not at all [inaudible 00:03:37] and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew and steaks and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat. We also feel great about it as a protein from an ethical standpoint. I highly recommend trying their all-natural Venison jerky sticks for an optimal protein snack, as well as a wide variety of fresh cuts, all available in their online butcher shop.

Jason, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Jason Feifer (00:04:13):
Lenny. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:14):
It's absolutely my pleasure. We've actually collaborated on a couple of things recently, and as we were chatting about some stuff, I was asking for advice on how to help a startup I'm working with get press, and you shared a bunch of killer advice, and so I asked if you could just come on this podcast and share similar advice for how to help startups get press and here we are.

Jason Feifer (00:04:36):
Yeah, I'm really happy that you asked me to do that. This is something people ask me about a lot. I've been in media for decades. I've worked at a lot of different magazines. Obviously, I run Entrepreneur Magazine now, but I was a Fast Company. I was at Men's Health, so I've seen a lot of different sides of media, and it is a very misunderstood tool, particularly for people in business, and so I love demystifying it.

Lenny (00:05:00):
Amazing. I'm excited to learn all this too, and so thanks for doing this.

Jason Feifer (00:05:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:04):
First question is just, as someone in press, how much volume is there coming at you from startup founders and PR people trying to get you to write about them and also just reporters that you work with?

Jason Feifer (00:05:15):
Yeah, it's tremendous. It's ridiculous. I would say that by the time we are done recording this podcast, I'll have, I don't know. I mean, it could be anywhere from 30 to 50 pitches in my inbox. It comes all day. Now, to be clear, most of that is garbage in the real garbagey sense, right.

(00:05:36):
It's a lot of completely unrelevant press releases that were sent to me and a bazillion other people. But within, there are definitely some people who have spent the time to reach out very specifically to me, and everybody in media gets some kind of volume like that. To reach out to somebody in media is to be shouting over a lot of noise.

Lenny (00:06:01):
Wow. I imagine we'll get to this later, but I'm curious just what percentage of those are PR people and press release versus a founder or someone that is doing it themselves?

Jason Feifer (00:06:12):
The percentage of direct messages from founders that I'm getting is low. I would say probably 20, 25%. And then the 75% is PR in some capacity, either targeted PR where somebody's intentionally reaching out to me or mass blast press releases.

Lenny (00:06:30):
You know what's crazy is I've been getting a lot of these now. People think I'm some kind of journalist, and they're just like embargoed announcement product launch.

Jason Feifer (00:06:37):
It doesn't take much because you just end up on some list, and what's really interesting, and we'll talk about PR later, I know. But one of the great insights that you can get into the challenges of that industry is how completely automated a lot of it is where a lot of people in PR are not thinking specifically about how to tell the right story to the right potential media outlet. Instead, what they're doing is they're just playing a numbers game, and they're just blasting it out to everybody.

(00:07:13):
And that means that you could end up... I write this newsletter, right. I have... Entrepreneur Magazine is the thing that people obviously would pitch, but then I have this newsletter where I don't interview anybody. There's no opportunity to be featured in my newsletter, and I still get pitches to the newsletter because somebody saw it and dropped it in some spreadsheet, and it just... now I get it. And I think that's a real disservice to entrepreneurs who are paying for people to do that, and I really hate that.

Lenny (00:07:41):
Yeah. Okay, so we're going to get into the meat of just how to actually do this well, but a couple more questions just to set a little context. One is in terms of impact. What kind of impact have you seen from getting press for a startup in terms of growth for their product specifically?

Jason Feifer (00:07:57):
So it's a really wide range. I have had entrepreneurs tell me that a single story in Entrepreneur Magazine, like the print magazine or just online, will drive more, whatever more app downloads, more sales that month than any of their paid marketing efforts.

(00:08:16):
But then I have also heard entrepreneurs tell me that it didn't do anything for them or that it did one very specific thing for them, which is to say maybe some potential partner read it and reached out, and it started an interesting conversation. It's all over the gamut, and it's a really important thing for people to remember is that this is not something that I think that you should bank on as a strategy for growth. It's a great add-on. But if you think that press by itself is going to solve your problems, you're wrong because it might, but it's way too unpredictable.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Is there anything else along those lines of just when it's worth somebody investing time into getting press, either stage of startup, type of startup, any just general broad advice of you should not be spending time on trying to get press versus this is a really good opportunity for you.

Jason Feifer (00:09:02):
Think about press the same way that you think about raising money, which is to say you do it when you know what the money is for, and you should do it when you know what the press is for. A lot of people reach out to me at such an early stage that if we wrote about them, it wouldn't get them anything. They're not at a stage where they could use that press in any meaningful way, and so there's really no purpose in chasing it now. You should step back and think really as a starting point, "What do I need press for?" And if you have a good tactical answer to that, that could be because I need to drive awareness to a new product. That could be because I'm going out to raise money, and I need articles to show that the marketplace takes me seriously.

(00:09:55):
These are good reasons, but I get a lot of emails. It's funny because people are... like entrepreneurs, in particular, they're just so vulnerable, and it's kind of a wonderful way sometimes. And sometimes people will just email me, and they'll just say, "You know, I've worked really hard, and I just feel like I deserve this." I respect that, and I relate to it in some ways with my own trying to get attention for my own work. But, "I deserve this" that's not a good tactical decision for your business that doesn't do anything for you. And so I would put that to the side and only think of press as you don't go out and raise money if you don't know what the money is for. You shouldn't go out and try to get press if you don't know what the press is for.

Lenny (00:10:38):
I'm curious to hear other examples when it's not, when it's a bad idea because, as like I said, an outside observer, I would always love to get more attention for my product and more people to be aware of it, more people to check it out. Is there an example or anything that comes to mind of there's no need for you to do that in this moment or for this product?

Jason Feifer (00:10:55):
Oftentimes, it's not even about the moment, but it's about the publication. So I'll give you an example. I spoke at an event once, and afterwards, this guy comes up to me, and he has a small hot dog food truck business in Washington, DC. So he said he's got a couple trucks, and he's doing good business selling hot dogs, and he wants coverage in Entrepreneur Magazine. He's like, "Oh, how can I get a feature?" And the problem with that instinct that he has is that he's really directing his energy in the wrong place because if he is selling hot dogs in Washington, DC, then I understand what press is for him. Press is to drive hotdog sales. That's what he wants to do. Entrepreneur is not going to do that for him. Full stop. Why? Because Entrepreneur reaches a national to international audience.

(00:11:52):
So that means that 99.5% of the people who would read a story about this guy have no ability to go get his hotdogs, which means that that was wasted effort. So fine. Was it that hard to come up and talk to me at the conference? No. But scale that out. How many emails is he sending that are like that? How much energy is he putting into chasing things that ultimately don't have good direct value to him? What he needs to do is think, "Okay, my goal, get more people to buy hot dogs. Where am I? I'm in Washington, DC. How can I reach people who are interested in food in my market?" So stop chasing Entrepreneur and start chasing the local eater or the food section of the Washingtonian or something like that. That small shift can give you a lot more payoff for your effort.

Lenny (00:12:38):
This is a good segue to just let's just dive into how to actually go about getting press, and I know you-

Jason Feifer (00:12:38):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:12:42):
... kind of have this three-step structure for thinking about it. Maybe just start with what are the three steps, and then we'll dive into each one.

Jason Feifer (00:12:50):
Yeah, sure. So I mean, look, it is pretty simple, right. Step one is prep. You want to be thinking about how to tell your story. You want to be thinking about the kinds of stuff I just talked about. What is press for for you? Everything that you need to do to orient yourself towards what is this opportunity, and why am I chasing it, and how to make the most of it. Step two is figuring out who to pitch. Not all press is created equal. There are not reasons to just go chasing everybody arbitrarily. The hotdog example is a good one.

(00:13:19):
So finding the writers and editors who you're actually going to reach out to, who are going to most receptive to you. And also making sure that because you did the prep, you can figure out how to tell your story in a way that they're going to be interested in. We'll talk about that. And then step three is the actual pitch. What does it mean to reach out to these people, to engage the writers and editors? How do you find them? What do you send them? What are you telling them? That's it.

(00:13:42):
I mean, right. But what you need to understand is that you're entering a world that probably doesn't operate the way in which you think it does, and I see that all the time as the recipient of pitches. People don't understand who they're reaching out to and how I and my colleagues think. We should maybe even start with that because a really important thing to understand just again, to go to [inaudible 00:14:07]-

Lenny (00:14:07):
[inaudible 00:14:07] do it. Yeah.

Jason Feifer (00:14:08):
... yeah, the metaphor of the investors, you don't reach out to an investor if you don't understand what that investor does, what they're interested in, or what kinds of companies they invest in. You can't do that with media, either. So I get pitches every single day along the lines of, "How do I get coverage in Entrepreneur Magazine? How do I get a feature in Entrepreneur Magazine?" And to me, it always feels like they're ordering a hamburger from me. Like, "How do I get a hamburger from Entrepreneur Hamburgers, right?" They're treating me like a service provider. That my job is to provide press.

(00:14:44):
And I get it because, of course, if you're an entrepreneur, and you're looking for press, then the... [inaudible 00:14:51] writers and editors out there seem to be in the business of writing about people, and therefore, there's some service that they seem to provide, and you're trying to figure out how to get it. But that's not how the media thinks of themselves, right. The editor, the writer, I'll just say it as plainly as possible, they don't care about you. They don't care about you. They care about their reader, or their listener, or their viewer.

(00:15:18):
That's who they care about. That's who they're serving. And if you can be of use to them in sharing the kinds of information that they are looking to serve their audience, then you can get what you want, but you can't treat them like a service provider because they're not. And so you have to approach them with an understanding of what they're trying to do for their audience and how you can fit into that. Because if you don't, they are not interested in you.

Lenny (00:15:49):
I love that. And more... even specifically, what is it they're trying to do for their audience? I imagine it's just have something interesting that they want to read. Something they can learn. Something they're like, "Wow, I'm really excited to read this."

Jason Feifer (00:16:00):
Yeah. But it's going to be more specific based on the mission of each publication. So, for example, I've worked at two separate business titles. I was a senior editor at Fast Company for a number of years, and now I'm the editor-in-chief of Entrepreneur Magazine. The decision that is made about whether or not a story belongs in a publication, it was totally different based on these two publications. So I can't speak to Fast Company now because they've gone through a couple of leadership changes. I don't know what their mission is, but back when I worked there under Bob Safian, he was the editor-in-chief, that was really a magazine about where businesses going, and the stories that were in the magazine were all supposed to be in some way representative of the evolution of business.

(00:16:50):
And so when people would pitch what we'd really be looking for are, are there insights into... in what this person is doing that other people could read and say, "Aha, that helps me understand where this industry is going or that industry, or it helps me think about how I can shape my own company to match current trends," that kind of stuff. Entrepreneur, totally different mission. The way that I think of Entrepreneur is that it's not even a magazine about business. It's a magazine about thinking. Or what I want to do is make sure that everybody who comes to the magazine walks away with great insights into how to think through the challenges in their business.

(00:17:29):
And so what I'm looking for when somebody reaches out is did they make some interesting counterintuitive decision that solved a problem in their business, and I'll emphasize in. Because, oftentimes, when people hear me talk about solving problems in business, they think, "Aha, but I solve a problem in business, right. I saw that there weren't the best razors in the world, and I made the best razors." That's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is... There's this woman whose name is Joelle Mertzel. She has a company called Kitchen Concepts Unlimited, and she makes a butter dish, and it's a really smart butter dish because it is built on a hinge, right. So this is designed to solve a very specific problem, which Lenny, I don't know if you knew this, I did not, that you don't need to refrigerate butter. Did you know that?

Lenny (00:18:18):
I knew that intellectually, but I still refrigerate it. I know people don't.

Jason Feifer (00:18:22):
Me too, even though I've had multiple conversations with this woman about this. You don't need to refrigerate butter, and if you leave it out, it cuts easier. It's more spreadable. Big problem, the butter dish. So most butter dishes you just lift up. And so if you have warm room temperature butter that's soft, and you lift the butter dish top up, you might bump into the butter, and it's going to make a big mess. So Joelle makes a butter dish on a hinge, right. Opens and closes exactly the same way every single time. No mess. Brilliant, solves a problem. She reaches out to me about this. This is not interesting to us, right. Maybe this is interesting for a cooking magazine, right. Maybe Bon Appétit is interested in this. Entrepreneur's not interested in this because that doesn't help other entrepreneurs to have thought through that problem.

(00:19:13):
But then she tells me something else. What she tells me is that she is, at the very beginning of this, trying to figure out how to answer some basic questions about her audience, like what colors do they want in this butter dish and what price point are they willing to pay? And she wants to do some market research. She goes to a market research company. She says, "How much would it cost to research consumers and answer these questions?" They say, $10,000. She doesn't have $10,000. And then, one day, she's sitting at the airport waiting to board a flight, and she looks around and she realizes that airports are full of people who have absolutely nothing better to do than answer questions about butter dishes, right. Nothing better to do, just sitting there. And you could start at gate one. By the time you get to gate eight, everyone in gate one is new. You could do it all over again, and you could have a 6:00 PM flight, and you could show up at 9:00 AM. Nobody's going to stop you. You can do this all day in the airport. And this is how she starts to do her own market research. She saves that $10,000, and she does it herself. I put that story in the magazine. It's tiny. It's this tiny random company and this random decision. But the reason I did it is because every time I repeat that story to entrepreneurs, they're all like, "Ugh, right, totally. There's always other ways to do things." They love the ingenuity of it. That's what I'm looking for. That's Entrepreneur's stories. So to go back to the point that you were making, it's not just about, "Well, it's a magazine called Entrepreneur. They must write about entrepreneurs, right. I'm an entrepreneur. I belong in Entrepreneur."

(00:20:41):
People think that all the time. No. You have to step back and read what these publications are publishing and ask yourself, "What are they doing? What is the purpose here?" The editors and the writers, they're making decisions about what goes in this magazine, and they're making decisions about how the stories are constructed. Why are they doing that? Who are they trying to reach? When you start to see it through that lens, you start to see the pattern, and you get an understanding a real instruction manual for what it actually means to pitch these publications.

Lenny (00:21:13):
That is such an interesting insight. I had no idea that that was something you should be thinking about. Is there an easy way to understand the mission of the publication? Is there an about page they often add this to or is it, like you said, you just read a bunch of stuff and try to suss it out?

Jason Feifer (00:21:28):
Nobody publishes an about page in that way because the internal logic of the editorial team. But you can certainly make some starting assumptions based on who the publication is trying to reach. Everybody is trying to reach somebody. It gets more complicated the more general interest something becomes, right. What is the New York Times?

(00:21:53):
What is the mission? That's a hard thing to answer. You sort of have to divide it up into sections, right. The mission of the National News Desk is different from the mission of the Business Desk, and even within there, the mission of the Sunday business section is different from the mission of the Monday to Saturday business section.

Lenny (00:22:09):
[inaudible 00:22:09].

Jason Feifer (00:22:09):
So you have to start to really parse it out. And this is the reason why people hire PR is because if they're good at their jobs, they understand a lot of this already. But I really do think that if you spent time with the content and your starting point is, "I understand that this publication is trying to reach X. They're trying to reach these people," then you can start to see the patterns of what it is that they're doing. How are they telling stories? What do these five stories all have in common? They have something in common. There's something that they're all doing, and you can certainly read the tea leaves and try to figure it out.

Lenny (00:22:48):
Awesome. Okay. It feels like we've already gone into step one around prep. What else is involved in preparing to get press?

Jason Feifer (00:22:57):
If we're talking about prep, the very first thing that you need to do is what I had said earlier, which is just ask yourself, what do I need press for? And you need a good answer to that question. And once you have that, the next thing you should do is you should start to think about, "Well, what's interesting about my business? And oftentimes, it's not necessarily what you think, and you can be guided in a way by what's happening in step two, where you start to think about who you're trying to reach out to. Because, for example, the story that somebody might tell me at Entrepreneur is going to be different than the story that somebody might tell Cosmo.

(00:23:42):
There's a reason for a company to end up in, both Entrepreneur and Cosmo, right. Maybe the product is for young women. And so, Cosmo might be interested in some kind of product feature or including the product in a roundup of some kind of products. Whereas Entrepreneur would do the entrepreneur-focused story. What did this founder do? How they do they write? You can take your... You could think about your story and kind of break it up into a whole bunch of different little pieces and then figure out which piece goes to what media. But oftentimes, people make the mistake of trying to do that in reverse, which is to say that they kind of decide what narrative they would like to have out in the world, and then they just go around to different publications trying to sell them on that. I get that all the time.

(00:24:34):
A lot of my pitches that I'll receive in my inbox are somebody who hasn't really thought at all about what Entrepreneur publishes but instead just has something that they would like to get out into the world. I mean, a good kind of dumb example is, yesterday, somebody sent me an email about a company that had just hired a new president. I don't care about that. That's not useful to my audience at all. I'm sure that there is a trade publication, right. Let's say that there was a company in the restaurant industry. I'm sure that a trade publication that follows the blow by blow by blow of a restaurant industry might be interested in your new president. But I'm not because you hiring that new president isn't useful to my audience. Stories in Entrepreneur are not really about the person that I'm writing about.

(00:25:23):
They're really about the audience. They're really me serving the audience through the stories of the people I'm writing about. That's not useful. I wish that they had spent a moment and thought about that, but they didn't. So once you start to think about who it is that you're trying to reach, you can step back and say, "Well, what part of my journey is going to be most relevant to them? And I would push you to be really, really creative about it. Because if you go back to the Butterie example, the butter dish, that little funny story about the airport, I mean, who else is writing about that? It's not central to her story as a brand. It's not central to her sales pitch. It was-

Jason Feifer (00:26:00):
... central to her story as a brand, it's not central to her sales pitch. It was just for us. We were probably the only publication in the world who cared about that, but I really cared about it.

Lenny (00:26:11):
Amazing. Okay, so just kind of summarizing what you shared, think about the goal. What are you trying to get out of press? Goals could be awareness of what we've done, something new, investor interest. What are some other common examples of goals that you see for trying to get press?

Jason Feifer (00:26:27):
Yeah, awareness of something new. But also doesn't have to be awareness of something new, it could just be continued growth, trying to reach into a new marketplace. That's fine. Anything that's tied to growth or reaching a new customer base-

Lenny (00:26:45):
Cool.

Jason Feifer (00:26:45):
... would make sense.

Lenny (00:26:45):
That makes sense.

Jason Feifer (00:26:47):
But it could also be that you're looking to position yourself in your own marketplace a little differently. I see, for example, a lot of people, a lot of big companies, keep knocking on my door because we don't just hear from startups, we hear from major companies as well who are pitching stories. I know why they want to be an entrepreneur. They want to be an entrepreneur because they're trying to position their brand as also being relevant to small business owners. It's helpful to have that kind of context because coverage an entrepreneur can help them go out to the marketplace and say, "Look, we're also reaching X, Y, Z people."

(00:27:25):
So sometimes it's not even about a conversion, but rather it's about a positioning and that's a good reason to also maybe put forward your executives. Sometimes it's just about establishing your CEO or your founder as an authority in a particular area because you want them to be more trustworthy, you want them to be invited to more conferences. Because all of that stuff draws more attention to the company, all sorts of reasons to do this stuff. And then trying to get in front of investors, trying to get in front of partners. Look, there's a million reasons why being visible can be useful, but you need to make sure you understand what you're actually trying to do.

Lenny (00:28:07):
Okay, awesome. That was really helpful. So think about what goal you have in mind for getting press, pick a publication and understand their mission and what their goals are. And then think about some interesting stories that you could pitch them. Not just like we have a new president, but something that you think they'd be excited to share that connects with their mission.

Jason Feifer (00:28:25):
That's right.

Lenny (00:28:26):
Kind of on this topic, I know we want to talk about who to contact and how to figure out who to actually talk to. A couple of questions that come to mind. This is all a lot of work. Founders are really busy.

Jason Feifer (00:28:35):
Yeah, it's a lot.

Lenny (00:28:35):
So begs the question, PR agencies, do you have a perspective on would you recommend working with PR agency? Is there a time when it makes to and doesn't make sense to?

Jason Feifer (00:28:45):
Yeah, I mean it's a ton of work. Everything that I'm describing is a ton of work. And let me be clear, people succeed in getting press without doing any of the things that I'm describing because dumb luck happens in the world. You could very well just bang out an email to some random editor and they might like it. That is entirely possible. You could disregard everything that I've just said. What I'm really helping you do is try to optimize your approach. But yeah, hiring PR can cut out a lot of this. Now you're not doing this research yourself, you're not thinking through these challenges yourself. You're working with people who understand exactly how to identify the most interesting parts of your story and then turn them into good pitches. So why wouldn't everyone do that? The couple reasons. Number one, cost PR can be expensive, so you just have to factor that in. Number two, PR is and can be, I'll say can be, a very frustrating journey because a lot of PR people are very bad at their jobs. They're very bad.

(00:29:52):
And this isn't just me bashing PR people. I have literally been hired to give keynotes at PR industry conferences. And I get on stage and I say most PR people are bad at their jobs and everybody nods. And they all know it. And of course, none of them think that they're one of the bad ones, but they all know it. PR is full of people who are bad at their jobs. Why are they bad at their jobs? They're bad at their jobs because they're lazy, because they're primarily relying upon email blasts, just sending things out, because they have a older idea of what it means to get the word out. For example, if you hire or talk to a PR agency and one of the things that they recommend doing that you should spend money on is a press release, like a traditional press release, run as fast as you can away from that. I don't know if you know this. Do you know this? The press release, there are some purposeful reasons to put out a press release, but the press release is really no longer the primary unit of press attraction.

Lenny (00:31:07):
Yeah, I get that sense.

Jason Feifer (00:31:08):
Yeah. But here's what's fascinating. So a PR agency I wouldn't recommend might do this. They'll tell you, "We're going to put together a press release about this new thing, so you have to pay a little extra money for the production of this press release and then also the distribution of this press release because what we're going to do is we're going to put it out on the wire," because there are a whole bunch of press release distribution wires. So they'll do that, you'll pay the money, it'll go out on the wire. And then they'll send you a report about all the places that this press release ended up on. It ended up on Yahoo Finance, it ended up on Market Watch. And it technically did. The press release is there, it was posted. And zero people are going to see it in the whole world because Yahoo Finance has a section where they just publish every damn press release that gets published by all these different distributors. Nobody saw that.

(00:32:08):
So don't confuse posting press releases even on very big websites with actual success. What you want in an actual PR person is someone who traffics in one thing, and that is relationships. The most important thing that a PR person can have is active relationships with people in media. Why? If a PR person is guaranteeing you press, that's another reason to run out the door as fast as possible because the PR people cannot control this. Writers and editors, they do what they want. It's a completely subjective industry and very frustrating. I completely understand. That was totally subjective. So the best that a PR person can do is shape your story, understand who to pitch, and then get that writer or editor to look at it, to pay attention to it. There are some PR people in this world who I think very highly of. I think they're incredibly smart, incredibly good at what they do, and they only pitch me when they have something that they think I will genuinely be interested in. Instead of a lot of PR people who just send me some random thing every week or every day.

(00:33:21):
I don't pay attention to those people. But, I don't know, just shout out, when John Beer from Jack Taylor PR sends me ... John, I met him in a PR capacity a decade ago and we've since become friends. When he emails me, I pay attention. I don't write about it all the time. I'm not going to write about something just because I like John, but I will pay attention. And paying attention honestly is half the battle because people in media are getting so much email. So you want someone who's going to understand you, understand your industry, understand and know the people who they should be reaching out to, and who really respect you as an entrepreneur and are going to give you the hard feedback. Because there are a lot of people who will go and hire PR and they'll say, "I want you to email this and this and this and this and this publication."

(00:34:16):
And if the PR person just does that, all they're doing is annoying their contacts if they don't really feel like this was meaningful. You should like when a PR person pushes back on you and says, "You know what? I don't think that your story is right for that publication. Here's why." That's someone you should hire.

Lenny (00:34:34):
Is there any other PR people you want to call out as ones that you think are awesome?

Jason Feifer (00:34:38):
The challenge here is that I'm going to regret not including a whole bunch of people who don't pop to mind immediately, but-

Lenny (00:34:44):
We can include them in the show notes, whoever else.

Jason Feifer (00:34:45):
Yeah, sure. Okay, so let's see. Off the top of my head, so John of Jack Taylor, he does a lot of wellness stuff. So PR agencies tend to specialize, and so you want to make sure that you're going with people who really understand you and the media ecosystem that you are reaching out to. So I think John's really smart. Let's see. Hannah Lee at Hannah Lee Communications is great on hospitality stuff. So restaurants, hotels, booze, they're really smart. Jen Sesquila, sorry Jen, if I mispronounced your name. Max Borges Agency, really good on sort of consumer focused products. Greg Delman, he's based in San Francisco, he has a boutique shop called G3 Media and he does a lot of tech startups stuff, just really knows that world. Greg, I'll find writers through Greg because he just knows everybody. I just texted him recently and I was like, "I need somebody who can write about this very specific AI thing." He happened to be at TechCrunch Disrupt and he found some freelancer and connected us. That's great. So those are four. I will have more that'll give you for the show notes.

Lenny (00:35:55):
Amazing. Okay. This is really useful. If any come to mind as we're chatting, feel free to shout them out again. Similar question, when people are thinking about publications to go after, say you're a startup founder. Is there a list you could just share of just like, here's probably the top five, 10 that you should be thinking about? The obvious ones, you talked about entrepreneur, [inaudible 00:36:15] Company, TechCrunch obviously comes to mind. Is there others that are just like, "Here's a good list to start with?"

Jason Feifer (00:36:19):
Honestly, it really, so much depends upon what it is that you're looking to do. You could be a startup, founder and entrepreneur and Inc and Fast Company are for maybe some good reason not at the top of your list because you're a startup founder, but your goal right now is to reach consumers. And those publications don't reach consumers and they don't reach people who are in a buying mindset. They reach people who are in a creating mindset. So I would expect that if you have a startup and that startup is not B2B in some way, that it would be possibly very reasonable that business publications might not be your target right now. Maybe Men's Health is. Maybe, I don't know, anything could be. I think oftentimes people tend to think too close to them about where they belong. Lenny, here's a real kind of exchange that happens, which is if somebody will email me, I don't respond to every publicist.

(00:37:23):
It's just literally not possible. I would not have enough time in the day. I do do my best to respond to every entrepreneur who reaches out because I feel like they deserve a response. And sometimes somebody will email me and they'll send me something and it's just not relevant. And I'll reply and I'll just say, "Hey, thanks. Congratulations on what you've built. But this isn't a fit for entrepreneur." And maybe once a month somebody responds really in a testy way, and they're like, "But don't you write about entrepreneurs? I'm a great entrepreneur success story." It's like, no, that's not what we do. Yes, entrepreneurs are featured in our stories, but no, we're not just a directory of entrepreneurs. Here's a good way of thinking about it. If you have a startup and you're trying to figure out what publications to be in, go look at where your competitors have been featured. That's a great place to start. What audiences are they reaching and how are they doing it? That should give you some direction about where you might want to go next.

Lenny (00:38:33):
Awesome advice. On TechCrunch, do you have a perspective on is it worth investing in getting featured in TechCrunch?

Jason Feifer (00:38:40):
I'll tell you a sort of personal press journey moment, and then I think that it will translate into the answer for TechCrunch.

Lenny (00:38:47):
Amazing.

Jason Feifer (00:38:48):
Okay. Something we haven't talked about so far yet is, and this is sort of almost skipping all the steps that we've laid out to what happens after you get the press. But the point of the press is sometimes to reach the people who are reading it. You get covered in Entrepreneur and entrepreneurs are going to read it and maybe something good will come of it. But sometimes the point of it is not to reach the people who are reading it at all. Possibly a very small number of people are going to read it, which by the way is a real, real possibility. Because although all of these publications that I have mentioned, Entrepreneur, Forbes, Fortune Inc, Fast Company, whatever, these are reaching millions of people, their websites get many, many, many millions of unique visitors each month. That does not mean that your story is going to be read by millions of people.

(00:39:40):
In fact, the largest possibility here is that your story will reach five to 10,000 people, a small number of people because these publications are publishing tons of stuff. So you might get this story, it might look awesome, it might not reach that many people. That might also be okay. Because maybe the reason in your logic for why to get that kind of coverage is not to have reached that publication's audience at all anyway. Maybe what it really is is to tweet it and then put some money behind promoting that tweet because then you can target that you got coverage to the people who you want to notice you got coverage.

(00:40:21):
And I see a lot of people do that. They'll take articles that we ran on Entrepreneur and they'll basically turn them into advertisements. And that's really smart because what they got out of Entrepreneur was the social cachet. It was the validation in the marketplace. And then they're going to do something with that themselves. That's really smart. You also see it sometimes the reason to get coverage, it's just so you can put it on your website. As seen in. As seen in is probably more valuable than anyone actually reading that story to begin with. They probably won't read the story. You might not even have to link it on the website. But you could just get to say as seen in. Because again, it gives you that validation.

(00:40:56):
Me personally, I am building a small podcast company with my friend Nicole Lapin. Nicole Lapin is a bestselling business money expert. And we have a company, she's the founder and I'm an advisor. And it's called Money News Network. We have a podcast on it called Help Wanted that we co-host together. And we got coverage in Variety. And that was the result of pounding on a lot of doors and finally getting someone at Variety to take interest and they ran an article about us. Did we get anything from that story in Variety? The answer is no, like nothing. But you better believe that every email we send out to every potential advertiser, to every partner, includes the link. Variety has covered us. And I guarantee that when someone receives that email, it makes them pay more attention.

(00:41:52):
And I have used it many times too when I reach out to people. It just gives you that validation. So sometimes what you're looking for is a prize to walk around with. And I would bet that the same is true for TechCrunch, which was your original question. Why get the funding announcement in TechCrunch? Probably not because anyone's going to care because they read it on TechCrunch, but now you can use that to your own means. And sometimes that's more valuable than the press itself.

Lenny (00:42:16):
That is an awesome insight. It also makes you realize you may not feel like it was a success after spending all this time getting in a story and entrepreneurs. Like, oh, nothing happened. But the benefits may come later, like weeks, months, years later when you start to share that.

Jason Feifer (00:42:30):
Exactly right. A lot of this is what you make of it.

Lenny (00:42:32):
Amazing. Okay. That was extremely interesting. Okay, let's talk about step two. So initially you prepped, we talked about how to think about who to go after and the mission and goals. Then you get to step two, which just figure out who to reach out to at a publication.

Jason Feifer (00:42:47):
Right. So a lot of people make the mistake of emailing me. If they want coverage in Entrepreneur, they email me. And I understand why they're emailing me. It's really for two reasons. One, I'm the most visible editorial person at Entrepreneur. And so it's easy to find me, it's easy to find my email address. And also they just assume, well, editor in chief, making all the decisions. But no. I mean, think about it. If you have a problem with a purchase that you made on Amazon, you don't email Bezos. He's too busy. And I am not comparing myself to Bezos. But I am the busiest editorial guy at Entrepreneur for whatever the hell that's worth. And I'm just not the guy to pitch because my job actually isn't really to select stories that go in the magazine. My job is to work with editors who develop their own ideas and then I get to say, "Oh, that's a good one," or, "Oh, let's refine that." I'm not sourcing as much. And so you really should start by looking at who's writing about your subject area.

(00:43:57):
And you can do that by going to the website and surfing around. You can do that by Googling around. But you'll find the answer. Every publication is structured differently. Some people have specific beats. Some publications will be like, "This is the person on the transportation beat." And some publications don't. Entrepreneur doesn't really have a beat system necessarily. But if you look, you'll figure it out. "Oh, that editor is clearly interested in food. That writer is clearly interested in food. They seem to write all the food stories." And a good way, again, to do it is to start with the publication and then look at how they're covering your competitors. So a good example is I was once consulting with a guy who has a kind of fun peanut butter company. It's like imagine peanut butter meets Ben and Jerry's, so it's like peanut butter with lots of stuff and fun names. And so he's trying to figure out how to get press. And originally his thinking, the reason why he reached out to me was because he's like, "Well, I'm an entrepreneur. I run a business. I should be in Entrepreneur."

(00:45:05):
I was like, "No, no, no, you shouldn't because none of our readers are going to buy your peanut butter. So who is your target audience? Who's buying your stuff?" And he says, "Millennial moms." I said, "Great. Okay, so Cosmo is a good place to reach them. So let's look at how Cosmo covers snacks." I don't know how they cover snacks. I don't read Cosmo, but let's find out. It's not hard. I went to cosmopolitan.com, searched for snacks. What I found immediately was a lot of stories that are all basically roundup-y and anchored to some time-sensitive things. So it's 10 snacks for Valentine's Day, it's our 10 favorite new fall snacks, whatever. It's all stuff like that. So now we know they are not going to run a thousand word feature on your peanut butter company. Instead, the best that you could hope to do is get into one of these seasonal-ish roundups.

(00:45:59):
So now next step, who's writing these things? Let's look. Let's open some of the articles. The byline is right there. You can click on the byline. You can see what this person does. And in many cases, maybe they're the food editor, maybe they're the lifestyle editor, whatever. You'll see what they cover. And you'll have a good understanding of now how to frame the thing that you're looking for. Now, let me introduce one other possible option. They don't work for the publication at all. They're a freelancer. Publications use a lot of freelancers. Freelancers are basically independent contractors. They're writers who are working sometimes. Sometimes they have longer term deals with publications. Sometimes it's just one-off. My wife is a freelancer. My wife is a freelancer who writes a lot for the New York Times and Washington Post and Guardian. And the interesting thing about my wife versus me is that my wife, whose name is Jen Miller, just so I don't keep saying my wife.

(00:46:58):
So Jen, on a day-to-day basis as a freelancer is hungrier for stories than me because Jen has to hustle for her food. Jen has to find stories and pitch those stories to editors at publications, and that's when she gets paid. So she actually is more incentivized to be looking for stories than I am because I am a salaried employee of Entrepreneur Magazine. And my email address is very easily found and people just send me stuff all the time. And I should add here also, note that a good journalist, a good writer is not actually sitting around thinking that their job is to wait for people to pitch them so that they can just write about the best pitches. Their job as they see it, is to go and find the most useful things for their audience. And they like to do a lot of that themselves. So they're not sitting around just waiting for your pitches. And in fact, your pitches have to overcome their instinct to go find things themselves.

(00:48:02):
So Jen is constantly hustling. Jen is constantly talking to people. Jen is curious about the world and will spend a lot of time hunting things down. But if somebody reads a story that she wrote and says, "Ah, I think I have an idea of what this person is interested in," and then tracks her email address down and then emails her, Jen is getting a lot fewer pitches than me, the chances of her reading it are close to a hundred percent. And the chances of her taking it seriously if it's relevant to any of the publications that she writes for is much higher than me. So sometimes going to the staff person is not actually your best move. Finding the freelancer who's doing the work is sometimes the better move.

Lenny (00:48:43):
So many interesting tactical insights that you're sharing. I love it. With this freelancer tip, how do you know they're freelancers? Is there something in the byline?

Jason Feifer (00:48:51):
If you find them on the publication's website so let's say that you go to Cosmo and you click on a author's bio. If they're staff, it'll say staff. If they're not staff, it'll probably say something else. It might say writer, it might say contributor. It might say Jen Miller is a writer in Brooklyn, New York. But also you can just go one extra step and just Google their name because any smart freelancer has a portfolio website where they should be very easily found.

Lenny (00:49:22):
Awesome.

Jason Feifer (00:49:23):
So sometimes just take their name, plug it into Google, you'll very quickly figure out who they are.

Lenny (00:49:28):
Okay, so let me summarize things that you've taught us so far. One is think about publications that go to people that will buy your thing. So in your example, Cosmo is a good example of someone who would buy this peanut butter thing. Two is don't think of it broad thing. Think about the writer at the thing. So it's not like Cosmo would write about this. It's like, who specifically at Cosmo would write about this? And we find that as go to their site, search for, you talked about search for your competitors, but I think it's even broader, just things related to your area, right? [inaudible 00:50:01].

Jason Feifer (00:50:01):
Yeahs, that;s good point. Search for your category.

Lenny (00:50:04):
Even adjacent things probably are close enough. And then this tip about freelancers is really great, that they're hungrier and that they're more likely to respond to your pitch versus someone that's working there. And then also this point that they're like, their assumption is this is not a good pitch and they don't want your pitch. But freelancers have a higher chance of being interested and will pay attention.

Jason Feifer (00:50:25):
Yeah, freelancers got to eat.

Lenny (00:50:28):
Amazing. Is there anything else along this step of finding somebody at a publication that you want to share?

Jason Feifer (00:50:36):
Well, the next step is going to be how to actually reach out to them and pitch. So at this stage, I think that we've fairly well covered it. And I love your summary. And just to double click on part of that, the reason why you're doing a lot of this is not just for the crazy busy work of it. But it's because you have to understand that the media ... Just sort of go back to translating the media. The media, which is a phrase that is used in all sorts of different ways, is a pretty bad way of actually understanding the media because the "media" makes it feel like it's a unified entity. In politics, the media will be criticized as a sort of multiple publications colluding together in some way. But the way that we're talking about it is just as organizations that you're trying to reach out to.

(00:51:25):
But really and truly, these are just publishing companies made up of individuals. And those individuals are all making fairly subjective decisions about what it is that they're going to write about. And there are layers of approval that they have to pass through. So nothing makes it into the print magazine, for example, without me saying yes. But I'm also trusting my editors to be passionate about the ideas that they're finding and convince me of yes. And so the thing that you are really looking to do is to find the way-

Jason Feifer (00:52:00):
The thing that you are really looking to do is to find the way in to a publication. Because nothing gets covered until a single individual at a publication takes interest in you enough that they go to somebody else and say, "I think that this would be a good story," and that other person says yes.

(00:52:17):
So you have to find your way in. Because media is not a coordinated effort. It's a bunch of people showing up every day trying to figure out how to make the best thing for their audience.

Lenny (00:52:27):
Amazing. Okay, so that's a great segue to final piece, which is actually, get someone excited and write about you.

Jason Feifer (00:52:33):
So how do we do that?

Lenny (00:52:33):
How do we do that?

Jason Feifer (00:52:36):
This is where the rubber hits the road, okay? So things not to do, don't call them, if you track down their phone number. Which is a real thing that happens. People call my personal cell phone number.

Lenny (00:52:48):
Oh, wow.

Jason Feifer (00:52:48):
It doesn't happen often, but it happens. And I don't even know where they get it from. But I don't like it.

(00:52:53):
And media people are torn on whether or not DMs by social are an okay way to reach out. I find them kind of annoying. Because, number one, the format doesn't lend itself very well, right? If you write anything wrong in a DM, it just looks like this endless thing that I got.

(00:53:13):
But also, I don't know, my Instagram DMs, I just kind of don't think of as the place to be pitched. But other people don't care. So I don't know, you can roll the dice on that.

(00:53:21):
Email is just the most traditional way. If you know somebody's going to be speaking at a conference, that's great, come up, you can talk to them. But the question of course is, what are you sending them? And here's what you're sending them.

(00:53:34):
You're really sending them the product of the work that you have done in the previous two steps. Because you have now spent some time thinking about your story, and who you're pitching, and the publication, and how they're telling stories to their audience.

(00:53:51):
And then the individual person who you're reaching out to, who you now have some sense of how they write about this. And you're taking all of that, and you're trying to distill it down into a presentation that they're going to find appealing.

(00:54:02):
Which again, to go back to the thing about how press is not that dissimilar to going out and raising money, that's kind of what you're doing when you go and meet an investor too.

(00:54:12):
If you have meetings with 10 investors, the way in which you talk about yourself and the company should not be exactly the same with those 10 investors, because they're all going to have somewhat different approaches and different thesis.

(00:54:25):
And you're not trying to scam anybody, but you're just trying to be as customized as possible by building in your knowledge of what it is that they do, and what their firm does. And the same is true for media.

(00:54:35):
So all of this is really going to take the form, in its most traditional sense, of a short email. A short email pitch. And what does that look like? I mean, look, there is literally no magic answer to that. I wish that there was, but there is not. There's no format. People always ask me, what should the subject line of the email be?

(00:55:00):
That's is a good question. There's not one answer to that. The closest that I can give you to an answer is that, picture me. Picture me at my computer. I have a lot going on, and I'm glancing at my email, and 40 new emails are sitting there. And my instinct is to delete all of them as fast as possible, but I'm going to glance at each one.

(00:55:23):
I'm not going to open each one, but I'm going to glance at it, which means that I see the subject line and I see the preview text, or just the first thing that somebody had written. What you want to do is write something that makes it pretty clear to me that this is targeted to me. That's step number one.

(00:55:40):
Because most of those emails that I got in my inbox are not targeted to me. They're mass blasts, and I'm delete, delete, delete, delete, delete. So which is the one that actually is reaching me? And sometimes you can do that by referencing something that I wrote in the past. I see people do that a lot. Don't fake it. People fake it all the time. People email me and they tell me they're fans of my work, they've never read my work. It's very obvious, right? Don't do that. But if you've read something, or if you're familiar with something, if you're familiar with the publication in some way, any signals of that are good.

(00:56:15):
Because again, what you're trying to do is just separate yourself from noise to, this is customized to you. Because If you think about it, this is really an efficiency question. What I'm trying to do is, I'm trying to spend my time on the things that have the highest percentage chance of being relevant to me. And I'm filtering out the things that seem not relevant to me, who are wasting my time.

(00:56:41):
So if I see something where somebody's writing me and they have a sense of the publication and they have a sense of me, there's a higher percentage chance that the next things that they're going to tell me are going to be relevant to me. Maybe even turn into a story.

(00:56:53):
Which is great. I like when that happens. Because it saves me time, frankly, right? It's one less story I have to find myself. So I'm happy for it, but it's got to be right. So you want to structure ... And then the email that you're writing is don't go on forever, like three paragraphs max.

(00:57:09):
And you are telling the version, you're not writing an article, but you're telling me the thing that you are pretty sure I'm going to be interested in. It's the difference between, going back to the butter dish example, woman sending me a three paragraph email about the butter dish itself, and opening up, telling me a little bit about the butter dish, and then immediately moving into this very clever story about the product market testing survey.

(00:57:43):
That's the difference. She told me the story that was going to be relevant to my audience. She got there quickly, and it felt like, to me, this is a interesting human being with an interesting entrepreneurial story to tell, and that's why I'm going to engage.

Lenny (00:57:57):
So that story actually came through a cold email?

Jason Feifer (00:58:00):
That was a cold email. Yep. Just showed up one day.

Lenny (00:58:02):
Amazing.

(00:58:04):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.

(00:58:18):
Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential. But there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.

(00:58:30):
When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:58:49):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's get Eppo.com, and 10X your experiment velocity.

(00:59:11):
Is there any other examples that come to mind, of someone doing this well? For people to have more kind of examples of here's...

Jason Feifer (00:59:17):
Oh sure. Well here, let's see. We'll have to do this in real time here. But I keep in my inbox a folder called Bad PR Pitches and a folder called Good PR Pitches. We can go through both.

Lenny (00:59:28):
Let's do it.

Jason Feifer (00:59:29):
All right, I just pulled this up. This is, and I haven't read this in a long time. I'm kind of trying to read ahead as I'm talking just to see if this is appropriate to read. But I think so. I don't know, whatever. We're just going to read it and see what happens.

(00:59:42):
All right, so the subject of this was, "Idea for entrepreneur and Problem Solvers, how the Border Closures grew my business." So this was sent to me in September of 2020.

Lenny (00:59:54):
And this is a good or a bad?

Jason Feifer (00:59:56):
This is good, this is good. This turned into an episode of a podcast that I do for Entrepreneur, and I might've also then converted it into an article I can't remember.

Lenny (01:00:06):
Awesome.

Jason Feifer (01:00:08):
And so here's what she did. So her name, I shout her out. So this is Meg O'Hara. And Meg O'Hara is a painter, a Canadian landscape painter. Which again, a small business.

(01:00:21):
And she writes, "Hi Jason, I have an idea for a story I think would be valuable and relevant to you, Entrepreneur Magazine and the Problem Solvers Podcast." That's the show I do for Entrepreneur. And then she says, "Here's what's going on with my business. All entrepreneurs had to be flexible during Covid. This is a story about how one artist in Canada benefited from the border closure." This just sort of intrigues me. Oh, how?

(01:00:42):
"When Covid hit in March, all ski resorts across North America shut down early. Skiers are a high earning demographic in Canada. They fall in the top 5% of income."

(01:00:53):
Okay, well anyway. So she goes on. What she tells me, I remember this now, what she tells me is that her business used to be being hired by ski resorts to come and paint landscapes for their facilities. And when the border shut down and people weren't going to these resorts anymore, she had to come up with a completely different way of doing her business.

(01:01:15):
And so she started to think, well, I can't work for these resorts anymore. They're not hiring me. But all these skiers who used to work at the resorts who have seen my work, or who used to ski at the resorts who were maybe familiar with my work, they're not skiing either. They probably are sitting around wishing that they were skiing. They'd love something to see of their favorite ski location, and they also have money sitting around because they're not spending it on the ski resorts.

(01:01:39):
So then she lists off the problems and the solutions in bullet points. Which I love. Because she has listened to the show, the Problem Solvers Show, which is structured in exactly that way. Tell me the problem, tell me the solution that you came to. So she lists it off.

(01:01:53):
Here are the problems: the skiers can't come, people are spending more time at home.

(01:01:56):
The solution: I create artwork for their homes that depicts their favorite views from skiing as they were. She goes on and on and on.

(01:02:03):
I read this and I just think, there is something here about what this person did to reinvent their business at a time in which one marketplace shut down, but it created a new one that I think people would like to hear. Because at that time everyone was thinking about how to reinvent themselves and their business.

(01:02:21):
And even though I reach people who have very complex and large businesses, sometimes it's really a beautiful thing to hear a single individual who does the simplest thing in the world, which is put paint to canvas, talk about how she did it for herself. Because you can extract these wonderful little lessons about how to reinvent yourself that I think are going to be relevant to a very broad audience.

(01:02:44):
So Meg sent me that email, I replied and I said, "I like it." And we did it. So that's a good example of someone who spent time understanding my work, down to the structure of how I'm communicating, and then sent me a pitch that very quickly and clearly seemed customized to me, and told me her story in a way that I could imagine telling my audience.

(01:03:12):
At that point, it's a pretty easy yes,

Lenny (01:03:14):
That is an amazing example. I just took some notes on things that she did right based on things you've shared in the past.

(01:03:19):
Even just from the subject line or the first sentence, it was clear that she knew you. She knew you had this podcast, she knew the magazine, and she even expressed this specifically, you're going to be interested in this. She mentioned how this, she has a story. She starts immediately with a story. There's not the value prop of the company, here's what we do and here's why we're awesome. And then the lessons, the mission of Entrepreneur you talked about, is insights and lessons that people achieve, and she just went straight to here's what we've learned.

Jason Feifer (01:03:49):
That's right.

Lenny (01:03:50):
So I could see why that resonated.

Jason Feifer (01:03:51):
Yeah, it was great. And the next thing that made it a real success, by the way for her, was that once I got her on the phone, she was, and I find this, this is a make or break thing for me. Because I can talk to somebody and then kill the story, or not run the podcast. She was willing to be open about challenges.

(01:04:17):
I mean, she had reached out because of challenges, but not everyone is. I will get a pitch from someone who is presenting like, oh, we had this challenge in the business. But then when I talk to them, they act as if there was no problem. Or the problem was really small and their ingenuity immediately made this a very successful business. And that's not interesting to me.

(01:04:42):
Because success stories are not interesting. They're not interesting to anybody. It's not useful for you to just hear that someone else succeeded. What's useful is for you to hear how someone else faced challenges that you faced. And got through them so that you can see. Aha, that's an interesting strategy to use for me.

(01:05:01):
I hate success stories. I love problem solving stories. And that's why when I talk to an entrepreneur, I expect them to be really open about that stuff. And if they're not, I basically lose interest.

Lenny (01:05:13):
The hero's journey. I'd love to hear another example. But before that, hearing this, obviously it takes a bunch of time to do this for a founder. I guess, two questions. Just, how many places should somebody probably try to reach out to give them a chance of being successful? And then do you have any thoughts on how much time they should put into something like this? I know it's a very broad question. But, any thoughts there?

Jason Feifer (01:05:35):
Yeah, it's a really broad question. So again, this is in some way why, in a large way, why a lot of people hire PR. Because PR can just move this along. They can reach a lot of people very fast, whereas you as an individual cannot.

(01:05:51):
One way to think about it is, you're going to be on the hunt. You're going to try to make this work, and you're going to take a couple bets and hope that some of them pay off.

(01:06:01):
Another way of thinking about it is, this is a passive activity. And I'll spend some time when I'm reading media, thinking about this, kind of developing an idea. Another thing that you can do, follow a bunch of writers and editors on social media.

(01:06:20):
Meg, I can't remember the order of operations here, because I know that Meg follows me on Instagram now, because she's DMd me many times. And I respond to everybody. I can't remember if she followed me before, but she might've. And maybe she even DMd me a few times. Usually it's somebody's responding to an Instagram story or something.

(01:06:38):
And I've seen a lot of people use this strategy with me, and I think that it's a really smart one. Which is basically, before you ever pitch, just get me to recognize your name. Just engage in social media in a very casual way, such that when you email me, I think, do I know who that person is? Meg O'Hara, I think I know who that person is. It just makes it more likely that I'll open the email.

(01:07:08):
And I see a lot of people do that. They'll spend a long time engaging with me on social media before ever pitching me. I know what they're doing, I understand that it's probably calculated. I still like it. It's smart. Because it means that by the time that they've reached out, I think you have a pretty good sense of my work. Which means that what you're bringing to me is probably in pretty good faith. And for that, I like it. It's a good filter.

(01:07:36):
So if you've been listening to this whole thing, and you're thinking, this is a tremendous amount of work, I have a new product launch, or I have a bunch of budget that I can spend on this, this individual kind of approach, it may not be for you. You might want to just spend a bunch of time instead interviewing different PR firms. And find the one that seems most aligned with and understands your story, and your vision, and knows people in your space shortcuts a lot of this.

(01:08:06):
But even then, even then, I think that having heard this is really useful. Because at some point, if the PR person is successful, you are going to get on the phone with the writer or editor. And it's very useful to understand how they think. That they're not there to serve you. That this isn't a service that they're providing you.

(01:08:27):
So you better understand what they're entering into this with, and what they have in mind. When they're asking you questions, they're asking questions, thinking, this is what my audience is going to be curious about. This is how I'm going to drive this person in this interview towards the kinds of insights that my audience are going to find gratifying.

(01:08:44):
So the more that you understand who you're dealing with, the better.

Lenny (01:08:48):
And also just having done it yourself, you'll better understand what to ask your folks, how they're going to work, find opportunities to improve the way they're operating. On that question of quantity, say you're doing this, say you're spending the time. I'm going to really invest in understanding Jason and whoever else.

(01:09:05):
Is there a rule of thumb you'd recommend? Try to do this for three publications to get one, or is it five? I don't know. Is there anything there that you could recommend?

Jason Feifer (01:09:14):
So it's really dependent upon how easy you are to write about. I may just sort of note, if you are some kind of B2B service, especially in some kind of very niche or wonky space, it's going to be really hard for you to get [inaudible 01:09:40]. So hard that it might actually not even be worth trying. Because there are other things that you can do, or things that we haven't even talked about yet.

(01:09:46):
You could say, you know what? Screw it. I'm not going to try to get coverage for my company. Why don't I just try to position myself as an expert? Right? It's a totally different kind of approach. Where instead, what you're maybe trying to do is just hook onto the news, try to get a quote or a perspective to a reporter who might be writing about something. I get these all the time.

(01:10:07):
Something breaks, some news breaks, and people start reaching out to me. And they'll say, "This just happened in the news. And my client," or sometimes just the individual, "I have this insight into this, and here's what I would say if you want to interview me."

(01:10:22):
It's not going to be a feature about you, You're not going to be the subject, there's no photo of you. You might get a quote. You might get a quote in a story. Which again, is all you need to be able to say as featured in on your website. So that's the reason why people do that.

(01:10:33):
So sometimes it's about that. Sometimes it's about you could just be a writer. You might try to just pitch authoritative articles by you to different publications. Get yourself out in that way. Sometimes, again, you're not going to be able to be easily written about. And sometimes you are. Sometimes you made some insane technology that everyone's going to be talking about, and it's going to be super easy for you to get press.

(01:10:56):
At which point your hit rate is going to be much higher. That's why going into this with really realistic expectations, and if you're going to work with PR, having PR who can set and hold you to those realistic expectations, can just save you a lot of heartache.

Lenny (01:11:12):
Along the same lines, there's always this idea of exclusivity and people want to write first about a thing. Say you talked about an awesome technology. Do you have advice on, do you just pitch the same thing to all of them and hope they all write about it? Do you pitch them different stories? Do you offer one an exclusive, any advice there?

Jason Feifer (01:11:29):
Everyone has a different approach to this. The number one rule here is just, don't do it in a way that the people in media feel like you're playing them. Because they won't have tolerance for it. I would rather walk away from something like this than do some funny dance with somebody.

(01:11:48):
So my favorite version of this goes like this. Actually, there's a founder who recently, I met him years ago. So when he reached out, I recognized the name immediately. And he reached out and he's like, hey, we did this really interesting thing and we haven't told anybody about it yet. And I'd love to see if it's a fit for entrepreneurs.

(01:12:10):
So I hop on the phone with him, and he tells me. And I'm not going to tell you what it's yet because we haven't run the story. But after 15, 20 minutes, I say, yeah, you know what? This is a really interesting story.

(01:12:20):
And frankly, I know other media outlets are going to be interested in this too, particularly because a finance element to it. So I think the Wall Street Journal, and Bloomberg, and those kinds of places are going to be interested in this.

(01:12:32):
He wants to go to Entrepreneur for whatever reasons he wants. I mean, I think probably two. Because number one, he wants to position himself towards that audience. And then number two, there's a trust factor. He knows me in a way that he doesn't know the editors over there. And so he feels like I'll probably treat the story more carefully.

(01:12:49):
So we worked out a deal, which he proposed. And the deal is that we'll get the exclusive, and there's going to be a three-hour window after our story runs, and then they're going to start responding to everyone else. And then they're going to start talking to other people, or maybe they'll even line it up and reach out to some other media.

(01:13:10):
And that's fine with me. I understand. And we're going to create a little embargo window. And we'll go first, and then they're going to talk to everybody else.

(01:13:21):
Sometimes you can offer an exclusive to someone in that you are going to release the news to everybody, but only one media outlet is going to get the interview. Which works really well if you have a big personality.

(01:13:35):
So for example, recently a company that Mark Cuban has invested in offered us that, right? They're like, we have this news. We're going to reach out, we're going to send the news everywhere, but we're going to give you the exclusive interview with Mark Cuban. He's going to do one interview and he'll do it with you. You can parse it out in any way. You just want everyone to feel like you're being upfront with them.

Lenny (01:13:57):
And that they're getting something special, as much as possible. That makes sense.

(01:14:02):
You touched on this relationship piece, and that's something I wanted to ask. It feels like in tech, a lot of reporters end up writing a negative story, because a lot of times that's what people want to read. Why is this destroying the world?

(01:14:14):
I actually had a fast company do a thing on me, and I talked to the reporter, and I had no idea. Was he going to just completely tear me apart, or is he going to be really friendly and positive over what I'm doing? And I have no idea, and it just comes out.

(01:14:24):
It's not like I look at it before it comes out. So do you have any just advice to give you a set, help if this is going to turn into something positive or negative? I know you have no idea

Jason Feifer (01:14:34):
What happened, by the way? Was it positive or negative?

Lenny (01:14:35):
Super-positive.

Jason Feifer (01:14:35):
Great.

Lenny (01:14:37):
I was very happy with it, yeah.

Jason Feifer (01:14:38):
Okay, good, good. I'm glad to hear that.

(01:14:40):
So part of it is the publication itself, right? Entrepreneur, and I would say Fast Company, are just sort of not in the business of running negative stories. And the reason is, it doesn't serve our audience. My audience is coming to me to learn things for their business. Tearing somebody apart just doesn't help them in any way.

(01:14:59):
So part of it is just what ecosystem are you dealing with? You can also look at the past work of the writer. And if you work with a PR person, it's funny because occasionally somebody has accidentally forwarded this to me, and I'll see the dossier that a PR agency will put together on me.

(01:15:17):
But a PR agency, if they set you up with an interview with someone, they'll usually do some digging. And they'll find, what does this person usually write about? What kind of stories do they do? What are they generally interested in? So you can have a sense, right? What kind kind of thing are they doing?

(01:15:33):
And past that, there's also a question of, well, what are you doing in the world, right? I mean, if there is something somewhat controversial about you, and especially if you're engaging with an outlet that is interested in that kind of stuff, there's a halfway-decent chance they're at least going to explore it with you, and ask you about it. And if you're weird and cagey with them, they're going to think that there's more to it, and they're going to start digging more.

(01:16:03):
But the ultimate answer here is that every part of this, and this has come through, I'm sure, in our whole conversation, every part of this process is really out of your control. Does somebody pay attention to you? What do they write about you? When do they write about? All of it is outside of your control,

(01:16:23):
Which again, is the reason why it's not smart to think about press as a primary strategy for driving growth. It's a good add-on, but these people are going to do what they're going to do. And the best you can do is read the tea leaves.

Lenny (01:16:37):
Yeah. It was a very weird ... I don't get press often, it's not like something I pursue. But it was just like, this is wild. I'm just going to talk to this guy, and then something will come out. I have no idea what it might be.

(01:16:46):
He might have things wrong, because I didn't get a chance to review, and might skew things. But it's a strange experience to go through. But it all worked out great.

Jason Feifer (01:16:55):
Yeah, it is. It's very strange.

(01:16:58):
It is, it's strange. And I find that people often don't ... In business, people understand the structure of what's happening. They understand that we're a business magazine, we're going to write a story about a business. It's going to take a certain form.

(01:17:14):
But I've done a lot of different writing, and I have had the experience many times over my career where I will spend a lot of time with people, and they will have really no understanding of what it is that I'm doing at all. They can't conceptualize it.

(01:17:30):
And then the story will come out and then they'll always reach out to me and they'll be like, oh, now I finally understand what you were even trying to do. It's fascinating.

(01:17:40):
It is a vulnerable experience, and you have to know that. And the more you try to control it, the more the reporter is going to be annoyed at you. And the more, in fact, the reporter might try to take a shot at you in the story as a result. Because they found you too controlling, because they felt like you...

Jason Feifer (01:18:01):
They found you too controlling because they felt like you had something to hide. This is not a comfortable thing. You have to go into this being vulnerable and you have to know that there's a chance that it could blow up in your face. That's the price that you're paying for reaching their audience.

Lenny (01:18:19):
Great advice. How about we do just one more example of an awesome email pitch that you got and then we get to our very exciting lightning round.

Jason Feifer (01:18:26):
I'll tell you about a pitch. I don't know that I have it in my inbox still, do I? No, it's not there, sadly. I'll just tell you about it.

Lenny (01:18:32):
Yeah.

Jason Feifer (01:18:33):
Ii leads to something that is another way of thinking about getting press, which I think is really important for people to remember. So far, Lenny, we've spent the majority of our time talking about press in the form of some kind of feature on you, writing about you or including you in some kind of prominent way in a story that's basically highlighting the thing that you wanted to get out there, your product or something about your business, something. Then we talked a little bit about another way of doing it, which is sort of putting you out as an expert in authority. There's another way of thinking about this, which is that you can either create or present context in which you just happen to be a part.

(01:19:18):
Here's the story pitch that I got that leads into this. This is years and years and years ago. I had just started at Entrepreneur. I hear from a guy named Fred Ruckel. Fred Ruckel has got a cat toy and it's called the Ripple Rug. It's basically, imagine a rug and then another rug kind on top of it, but ill-suited. The rug is lumpy, there's a lot of lumps in and there are holes. This is for a cat to kind of crawl in and out these spaces and bat and do whatever cats do. I don't know. I don't know a cat. He wanted to tell me about the sales of this Ripple Rug and about how the sales are skyrocketing and all the things that he thought made it special. It's made out of recycled bottles and whatever the stuff, made in the USA, all cool stuff, but not relevant to me because we're not cat toy monthly and we're not reaching a whole bunch of cat owners, not that I know of.

(01:20:16):
I replied and I said, what I usually say, "Congratulations on what you've built, but it's just not a fit for coverage." Now Fred stumbled his way into this, but he did really a very smart thing because what he responded with was he said, "Totally understand. If you're ever interested in learning about a gigantic scam that's happening on Amazon and eBay that we've been caught up in, let me know." I was like, "Oh, well, yeah, I guess I am interested in hearing about that." I said, "Tell me more." He sent me this long email. Fred loves long emails, and I got him on the phone and had him explain, and finally I understood it.

(01:20:53):
This is, and maybe people are familiar with this, but this is sort of known as Amazon to eBay arbitrage. Basically the idea here is that Fred is selling his Ripple Rug on Amazon, or at least he was then, I don't know if he still is, but he's selling his Ripple Rug on Amazon. There are a lot of people who are copying the listing for his Ripple Rug and making their own postings for it on eBay. They sell it for a slightly higher price. Let's say that, and again, I'm making these up, but let's say the Fred is selling his Ripple Rug for $30 on Amazon, so somebody will sell it for $40 on eBay. Then somebody buys it on eBay, they find it, they buy it on eBay, they pay $40, that person gets $40, takes $30 of it, goes to Amazon, buys the Ripple Rug, and then just has it shipped to the buyer. It's arbitrage.

(01:21:47):
You might think, "Well, why would Fred care about this? He still gets the sale." The reason he caress about this is because the Ripple Rug shows up at the customer's house and it shows up in a Amazon box, even though they bought it on eBay. They think, "Why did that happen?" Then the next thing they do is they go to Amazon and they discover that it's cheaper on Amazon and now they feel ripped off. Who do they feel like they got ripped off by? Fred, because they don't know about the arbitrage. They don't know that they exist.

(01:22:21):
This person who has at this point opened the cat toy and probably had their cat roll around in it, now shoves the whole thing back in a box and returns it and Fred gets dinged and that's why he doesn't like this. He has tried and tried and tried to get Amazon and eBay to stop this, but he said, "Nobody seems to care and all these small businesses are losing tons of money on returns because of this." I had never heard of this. I thought it was fascinating. It's like a problem small business owners are dealing with. I was like, "Fred, do you know other people who are dealing with this?" He's like, "Yeah, I talk to them on the line all the time." He sends me off.

(01:22:54):
I reported this whole thing out. I wrote this three 4,000 word story on this thing, and Fred was the main character because he was the way to understand this problem. I did all the reporting and I contacted the platforms and I contacted the people who make the arbitrage software. I did a whole report, but Fred got his press because sometimes, and here's the lesson, sometimes you are not the story, but you can be part of the story. Sometimes that means if Fred stumbled into it, but I get plenty of people who've reach out and maybe they have a real estate startup and there's something really interesting happening in the real estate space and they reach out and they tell me about this really interesting thing that's happening in the real estate space and the role that they happen to play in it. Now I think, "Oh, well that's interesting. Maybe there's a story about that."

(01:23:46):
My wife, the freelancer, Jen Miller, she's done this many times where she once did this story about there was a bunch of startups that were all related to helping people prepare for death in some way or another. She's not going to write about one of them, but when somebody reached out and said, "Hey, here's a trend happening and we are one of them." Well, great, that's an interesting story. She wrote that and the company that reached out to her got kind of prominent billing because they were the ones who reached out. You know Barbara Corcoran from Shark Tank?

Lenny (01:24:14):
I think so. I think so.

Jason Feifer (01:24:15):
Yeah. She's been a regular Shark Tank since the very beginning.

Lenny (01:24:19):
Mm-hmm.

Jason Feifer (01:24:21):
She made her fortune by building a real estate company called Corcoran, realtors, buy and sell property. The way in which she built this company is fascinating. Barbara, before she was Barbara Corcoran of Corcoran Realty, Barbara Corcoran was random New York City realtor Barbara from New Jersey. She was trying to figure out a way to distinguish herself from the masses. She came up with an idea which was to take her own sales data, the only window she has into the Manhattan real estate market at that time is what she is what her clients are buying and selling, which she's facilitating. She has that data, is going up or down relative to last year. She puts all this data together in what she calls the Corcoran Report, and she starts sending the Corcoran Report out to the New York Times and the New York Post and whatever.

(01:25:18):
Because nobody else at the time was putting together a report on the health of the Manhattan real estate market, everyone started reporting on the Corcoran Report as if it was an authoritative thing. It's produced by Barbara Corcoran, which immediately put her in the position of being an authority in this space. That was so smart, and I see it happen all the time.

(01:25:37):
My inbox will also be filled with, for example, a company that specializes in remote work consulting. Especially remote work consulting, you can hire them, it's a B2B service. It's hard to get press for that, here's what they do. They pay a surveying firm to find all sorts of things. The top states for remote work, the top companies for remote work, the top whatever for remote work. They produce all these surveys and they send the surveys out. The surveys get covered because now they're creating a piece of news. They're creating some context in which they just happen to live in. Hard to write about them, this random company, but you write about the survey, that's interesting stuff. Oh, it turns out that Utah is the top, I don't know if that's true, is the top state for, that's something that people will write about. You're giving people things to write about. Then once they do that, you are a part of the story. I get those pitches all the time. I occasionally bite on them and Fred from Ripple Rug got himself a big feature as a result.

Lenny (01:26:38):
That's an amazing other strategy. I imagine if I was a founder, I'd be like, "Hmm, what trends can I think about that I can tap into?"

Jason Feifer (01:26:44):
Yeah. Sometimes you have it in your own data. If you have a lot of data, you might, Zapier. Zapier is a great example. I get a pitch from Zapier every single year about the fastest growing business apps of the year based on Zapier data because they see what people are using and they just compile that together into a top 10 list and people run it. It's very smart.

Lenny (01:27:09):
Amazing. We've gone through all three steps. Is there anything else that you wanted to touch on that we haven't touched on? Anything else that you think would be really valuable for founders or product leaders trying to get press that we haven't already shared?

Jason Feifer (01:27:23):
This has come up in different ways, but I'll just put a point on it as a maybe final way of thinking about this. Be human, be human. Press releases don't work because they're not human. I don't like interviewing people who are on talking points because that's not human. You're ultimately engaging in a human business. A subjective decision is being made about how to serve an audience of humans. There's no right or wrong. There's no way to know. Media is a sort of barely data-driven industry because every story is kind of different. It's like it's hard. It's hard to optimize the product because the product changes every minute. You're dealing with humans and the more that you can be human in every step of this process, when you pitch, write a human email, don't write a thing that looks like it came off of some marketing copy. Write a human email to another human and then when that person engages with you, be very human with them.

(01:28:26):
I mean, Lenny, the reason why that fast company reporter liked you, I am very sure was because when they got on the phone with you, you were just like a normal nice guy. If you presented yourself differently because you just wanted to frame yourself in some way or you felt protective or something or whatever it was, the reporter would've thought, "This guy is a dick," and he would've written a totally different story.

Lenny (01:28:53):
Mm-hmm.

Jason Feifer (01:28:54):
Be as human as you can and you will be dealing with a human who will receive that.

Lenny (01:28:59):
Amazing advice. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.

Jason Feifer (01:29:04):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:29:05):
Are you ready?

Jason Feifer (01:29:06):
Let's do it.

Lenny (01:29:07):
Let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jason Feifer (01:29:12):
Andrew Chen's, The Cold Start Problem has come up over and over again for me because they're just really great lessons about network effects. I've been having a lot of conversations about anxiety and perfectionism with entrepreneurs lately, and a book by a psychotherapist named Katherine Morgan Schafler called The Perfectionist's Guide to Losing Control, is, I think, just a really great read.

Lenny (01:29:34):
Super cool. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Jason Feifer (01:29:38):
Movie? I don't get to see a lot of movies these days. I have two little kids, but I took my eight-year old to see the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which was great and a really nice way of, I loved them as a kid, and so it was cool to see the modern version. Then my wife and I just finished Better Call Saul like years late, but it was just perfect.

Lenny (01:29:56):
I haven't watched that series yet. I loved Breaking Bad.

Jason Feifer (01:29:59):
Oh, it's worth it. You got to.

Lenny (01:30:01):
Okay. Another series I got to get started on.

Jason Feifer (01:30:03):
I know it's too much, too much television.

Lenny (01:30:05):
I usually ask this next question too, like product leaders and growth people, but I'm curious what the answer for you would be is. Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask people you're interviewing? Usually it's about people you're hiring.

Jason Feifer (01:30:16):
Interviewing a job candidate?

Lenny (01:30:16):
Yeah, that's the ideal, but take it either way.

Jason Feifer (01:30:19):
I'll take it a little bit different because we've been talking about press. This is a really great strategy for interviewing people, and I'm going to tell it to you because I think that it's also good in any other context, and it might be a thing that somebody will do to you in an interview. My favorite strategy for interviewing people is to throw a theory at them, and I don't mean a theory of the world. I mean that maybe 10 minutes in after they have told me a couple different things and answer some different questions, I'll make a connection in my head and I'll say, "I want to run a theory by you. Do you think that the reason why you are really interested in this or you made that decision is actually because of this other thing that you told me a little bit about?"

(01:30:59):
You're listening. It's really active listening, and you're combining things together into some theory. The reason why the theory works so well is because it forces people to think in real time in front of you. I like that because I often interview people who have been interviewed a million times before. I interview Jimmy Fallon and The Rock and whatever. They've been interviewed a million times before, so how do you get them to think in front of you? The answer is to ask them the thing that they haven't been asked. What I love about the theory is that it shows them that you're really listening and you're trying to understand them. "It's so interesting that you did that. I wonder if it's because of," X, Y, Z thing. That gets them to react in a really earnest honest way.

(01:31:49):
I would say for what it's worth, as a job candidate tactic, it's not that bad either. My favorite job interview that I ever did as a candidate that I didn't even get the job was years and years ago, I interviewed for a job at New York Magazine. I interviewed with Adam Moss, who is not there anymore, but he was the legendary editor in chief. He made me, on the spot, drill down specifically into an idea. He was like, "What's your favorite section in Strategists," which is one of the sections of magazine. I was like, "I really like the real estate section." He's like, "All right, what would be a good neighborhood that we should feature in the real estate section?" I was like, "Oh, I don't know," I named a neighborhood. He's like, "What would be three good elements of that?" He just kept pushing me, drill down, drill down, drill down. There was no right or wrong answer. He just wanted to see how I thought. I found that to be incredibly powerful, and I do a version of that when I interview people.

Lenny (01:32:48):
Awesome. I love that. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Jason Feifer (01:32:54):
I use BIGVU, I don't even know how to pronounce it, BIGVU, B-I-G-V-U, all the time. It's a teleprompter app. I spent like $150 buying an actual teleprompter because I make a lot of video and that teleprompter is, it's actually for people who are just listening to this, I'm pointing at another desk across my room where it's sitting there and I've never used it. The reason is because then I discovered BIGVU, which is just a app that runs a teleprompter very close to the camera, either in horizontal or vertical mode. I've tested it out in a million different ways, and it really works like you're reading it and it really looks like you're looking directly at the camera. I love it. It has saved me so much time.

Lenny (01:33:33):
That is cool. You basically put your phone on your screen next to the camera or wherever your camera is?

Jason Feifer (01:33:39):
No, no, no. This would be for if you're recording, if you're recording on the phone.

Lenny (01:33:44):
Got it. You're staring at the phone and it's telling you what to say. I get it.

Jason Feifer (01:33:44):
Yeah. Yeah.

Lenny (01:33:44):
That's awesome.

Jason Feifer (01:33:47):
You write a script and then you just import the script and then you choose the speed and you can fuss with it, how many words per minute, and then it'll run the text very close to where the camera lens is.

Lenny (01:34:01):
Amazing. All right.

Jason Feifer (01:34:02):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:34:02):
I'm going to check that out. What is a favorite life motto that you'd like to repeat yourself, share with friends, something that comes up a lot,

Jason Feifer (01:34:10):
Something that I've been repeating a lot to people is something that I heard, so I recommended Katherine's book, The Perfectionist Guide to Losing Control. I met Katherine because I, we've since become friends, but I interviewed her for the podcast when her book came out. We were talking about feeling overworked and being stretched too thin, and she gave me this question, which I think about almost daily, and I repeat to people all the time, and that is, "What's the point of building something if you can't maintain it?" I love that question because I, like probably everyone listening to this, pushes themselves really hard, and at some point you have to step back and think, "Am I building something where at some point there is sustainability for me here, or is this unsustainable and what's the point of building something if you can't maintain it?" It's a great reminder for why you're building something and how you have to build it.

Lenny (01:35:03):
I have a very similar quote that my sister's partner once said that has stuck with me forever, which is, "Life is maintenance. Basically everything that you buy or bring into your life, you have to maintain."

Jason Feifer (01:35:16):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:35:17):
We got a new air conditioner. Now, we have a guy that comes every year to check it. You got a generator, someone's got to check that thing all the time. We got a toy, now I got to think about where does it go and do we throw it away? Do we keep it? Everything that you bring into your life, you have to maintain basically for the rest.

Jason Feifer (01:35:17):
Yeah, it's really true.

Lenny (01:35:33):
Yeah, so it's really, I think specifically for work, it's like you start a new project, you're going to have to-

Jason Feifer (01:35:39):
You're going to have to maintain it.

Lenny (01:35:40):
... maintain it, like this podcast, right? It's like, do you want to start a podcast and do it forever?

Jason Feifer (01:35:45):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:35:46):
That's a part of it. Part starting something is you have to maintain it.

Jason Feifer (01:35:49):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:35:49):
Yeah.

Jason Feifer (01:35:50):
I know we're in the lightning round and we've defied the logic of lightning rounds, but I'll just add one other thing to that, which is that I interviewed Michelle Pfeiffer for the cover of the magazine, and one of the things that I thought was most fascinating was that she started this fragrance company, and it's called Henry Rose. She said the major difference between making movies and building a company that she found, was that when you make a movie, all the work happens in the beginning. You make the movie and then the movie is out, and then you are done. You don't have to work on the movie ever again. She was not really mentally prepared for a company being the exact opposite, that the launch of the company is actually the start of the work and there's an endlessness to it. She said that it took her a solid year to adapt to that reality, and then it became fun. I think it's the thing people forget.

Lenny (01:36:42):
Mm-hmm, Well, that story, it's cool that you got to interview Michelle Pfeiffer.

Jason Feifer (01:36:45):
Yeah, she's great.

Lenny (01:36:46):
Final question. I was reading your profile line and you said that the only reason you were able to achieve what you've achieved in life and got to where you're today is something that you called the opportunity set B.

Jason Feifer (01:36:57):
Oh, yeah.

Lenny (01:36:58):
Can you just explain what that is and why that is so important to you?

Jason Feifer (01:37:02):
Oh, yeah, sure. In front of you right now, you, Lenny, you everyone listening, watching, there are two sets of opportunities. Opportunity set A and opportunity set B, opportunity set A is everything that's asks of you. If you have a job, it's what your boss expects of you. If you have your own company, it's what everybody expects of you. Doing good at those things is really important. That's a measurement of success. That's opportunity set A, everything that's asked of you. Then there's opportunity set B and opportunity set B is what's available to you, even though nobody's asking you to do it. That could be, again, if you have a job, that could be taking on new responsibilities or joining a new team or something. Personally, it could be pursuing a hobby. It could be starting a podcast because you like listening to podcasts, anything.

(01:38:01):
What I have found throughout my own career is that opportunity set B is always more important, infinitely more important. The thing is that if you only focus on opportunity set A, then you are only qualified to do the things that you're already doing. Opportunity set B is where growth happens and where you push yourself in different directions. I found a long time ago that it was just really helpful to think about these two things. Oftentimes, maybe we don't do opportunity set B because we don't know how it's going to pay off, or we don't know where we're going to find the time. I have always found, always, that engaging in these things of what is available to me, what's available to me right now around me, and nobody's asking me to do, leads to the next growth either because it turns into an actual opportunity or because it informs some future opportunity.

(01:38:58):
I got to Entrepreneur Magazine, zero, zero people, when I became editor in chief, zero people said, "You should hit the speaking circuit. You should get really good at being interviewed on podcasts. You should write a book." Nobody said any of that. My job was to make a good magazine and direct the editorial of the brand, but all those things were available to me, and once I recognized that, I realized that I can pursue them and in doing so, also think differently about who I am. Am I a magazine editor? Not really anymore. That's one of the things that I do now. I think of myself as an entrepreneur, as a person who is now in the business of helping others. I'm an entrepreneur who helps entrepreneurs. That's what I think of myself as. I only got there because I was thinking, I am here and therefore I can get there. Nobody's ever going to ask me to do it. I have to do it myself. It's the thing that I always think about, and it's the thing that keeps me up at night. What am I doing now that is leading me to something else? I'm the only one who can figure it out.

Lenny (01:39:59):
Beautiful. It reminds me of a recent podcast guest's advice, which is the best way to track your progress in your career and in life too is just measuring how many, "Oh shit" moments you have because those are the moments where you're growing, you're doing something. I think maybe it's an example of an opportunity set B where it wasn't the default path that's like, "oh, I think I should do this, even though it's really hard."

Jason Feifer (01:40:20):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:40:22):
What a beautiful way to end it. Jason, not only do I want to start working on press, it feels like very achievable to get press now. That was really energizing, like, "Holy shit, I could do this. I could just find some people, pitch them. Here's how I do it."

Jason Feifer (01:40:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:40:34):
Not only that, I'm going to look for some opportunities set B routes for myself too. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe pitch you on their story? How can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Feifer (01:40:47):
Oh, so Lenny, thanks for all the work you do, which I just really love, and for creating the space for me to share all this insight. How can you find me? Well, I'll offer two things. An opportunity set B, like a good launching point for both of them, I wrote a book, it's called Build for Tomorrow. It is meant for anybody who's going through any kind of change in their lives or their work. There's an audiobook version that I read myself, but also hardcover and eBooks, just find it wherever you get books. Again, it's Build for Tomorrow. Opportunity set B, that whole thing, is actually a chapter in the book, so I go into a lot more detail there.

(01:41:20):
Then if you want to get in touch and also get those kinds of things, I have a newsletter, which is called One Thing Better each week. One way to improve your work and build a career or company that you love. Again, the kind of opportunities set B, that's the kind of thing that I put out. It's very much about the personal and emotional side of work. You can find that by going to the web address onethingbetter, that's one, O-N-E, onethingbetter.email. Just plug that in. Onethingbetter.email. I said that's a good way to reach out to me because if you get the newsletter and you reply to it, it goes to my inbox. I guarantee I will write back to you.

Lenny (01:41:56):
Inside track. Jason, thank you again so much for being here.

Jason Feifer (01:42:01):
Oh, thanks Lenny. This was so fun.

Lenny (01:42:03):

# We replaced our sales team with 20 AI agents—here’s what happened next | Jason Lemkin (SaaStr)

## Transcript

Jason Lemkin (00:00:00):
Here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B, we're solving problems. Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition, I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. I've even got a special discount for the end of this month, and let me just help you. I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I've explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house. There's only Superchargers. I got you, don't I? That's the job of SaaS and sales because we're not selling commodities.

Lenny (00:00:48):
Today, my guest is Jason Lemkin. Jason created and runs Saastr, the world's largest community for SaaS and B2B founders. He also runs two of the biggest town conferences every year, one in the Bay Area, which attracts over 15,000 people, and one in Europe with over 3,000 SaaS executives, founders, and entrepreneurs. Before Saastr, Jason was the CEO and co-founder of EchoSign, which he grew to over 100 million ARR and then sold to Adobe where he ended up as a vice president of their web services business. If you follow Jason on Twitter or LinkedIn, you know how much wisdom he has to share about all aspects of building a successful SaaS business. 

(00:01:27):
In our conversation, we focus on what I find most product leaders have the least experience in, building a sales team. We get very practical and tactical on how long you should wait to hire your first salesperson, what your one to two first hire should look like, why you should actually hire two salespeople, not just one initially, how to comp them, how to interview them, when it's time to hire a VP of sales, how to avoid your salespeople flaming out and burning through all your cash. We also get into how to make the product and sales relationship healthier, including how to push back on sales and feature requests, why your head of product should be super involved in your sales process, how long you should make your trials, why you should avoid annual contracts, and so much more.

Jason also shares advice for running a conference, which I found super interesting. This episode went long because I just couldn't stop asking Jason questions, but as a result, I'm excited to bring you this incredibly rich episode on building your sales team.

With that, I bring you Jason Lemkin after a short word from our sponsors. 

(00:02:36):
Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product popups really annoying, "Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature." These popups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say, they just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them. 

(00:03:10):
They use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny.

Jason Lemkin (00:05:03):
Hey, I'm so excited. Long time. What's the expression? Long time fan, first time dialer or something?

Lenny (00:05:03):
Caller? 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:09):
First time caller, yeah, first time caller. 

Lenny (00:05:10):
First time guest. 

Jason Lemkin (00:05:11):
I don't know if that exists in 2024 or not, but yeah, that's me. So thank you so much for letting me come.

Lenny (00:05:16):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I feel like you're the kind of guy that I knew would be on this podcast eventually, and I'm glad that we're finally doing this. I also feel like we can go in so many directions. I feel like you have so many insights on so many parts of building a business, especially a B2B business, but I thought it would be most interesting to dive deep into building your sales team, essentially trying to help people figure out how to start their sales team, scale their sales team, and all the elements they go into it. How does that sound?

Jason Lemkin (00:05:46):
I think it's great. I think it's an evergreen topic, but I think there's remains a consistent set of confusion, fears around how to build a sales team, and it's evergreen. The tools change and the pace has changed, but the issues, I love to dig into them because we keep making the same mistakes as founders and executives again and again and again.

Lenny (00:06:09):
100% agree. It's such a black box to me. Sales, I've never done sales, and I'm always just like, "I have no idea what's going on here." So this is how I learned from folks like you. You touched on this now. Now, I wasn't going to get on this, but I think it'd be interesting just this question of, does everyone need a sales team? Will you need a sales team if you're listening as a founder? Is it simply, if you're a B2B business, you'll need a sales team? How should people think about, "Will I need a sales team?"

Jason Lemkin (00:06:34):
If you truly build a self-serve product, you can either never have a sales team or Slack defer it or Canva really defer it. Canva didn't really build a sales team until they were well north of 500 million in revenue because it's epic self-serve. Slack started all self-serve, and by the time they went public, the majority of their revenue was enterprise sales. So you can sequence things. You can have hybrid models like a third of Asana's revenue is still from self-serve, and two-thirds are from a self-serve motion. So there's all different hybrid things. 

(00:07:06):
The most important thing though I've found is however you get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, be honest, be honest, and if you've talked to them as a founder and you know that they need a sales type motion, they need effort to deploy it, they have questions about security, they have questions about competition, they have onboarding requirements, and you say, "Hey, I don't like sales, so I'm going to do a PLG motion," you'll fail.

(00:07:34):
One of the things that I've done with so many founders over the years, and it shocks them at first, is your first 10, 15, 50 unaffiliated customers, the ones that find you from the ether, they're the next 50, 100, 200, 1,000, and you can either embrace them or run for them. Too many producty founders find that, "Hey, gosh, I'm going to have to do sales," and they exit it. They exit it. 

(00:08:00):
I'll tell you a company I invested in 18 months ago when things were easier, maybe 20 months ago, they were doing 5 million in revenue, growing over 100% with the sales like motion. Things got harder, things got harder as they did for many of us, and they decided to fire the whole sales team, and now they're doing less than one from 5 million with beloved customers. If I told you the logos, your jaw would drop. Over 5,000 20 months ago to 1 million today because they fired the sales team because the founders didn't like sales, they thought it was icky, they didn't want to do it, they were tired of doing it. I can tell you several stories like this. 

(00:08:34):
So you've got to be honest about the ... Sometimes we get it just right on day zero. Sometimes we know exactly how our company is going to work or Lenny's podcast is going to work. We can predict the future perfectly, but I find in B2B, a lot of times the industry, we end up winning. The segment of the industry, the type of customer is not what we initially thought and either lean into it and be a success or run from it because sales is icky and risk failure.

Lenny (00:09:00):
When you talk about being honest, what you need to be honest about is that you need sales help to close customers?

Jason Lemkin (00:09:07):
Be honest about that. Just be honest about, yes, the motion that it will take to get those first 10, 15, 20 customers, and if they were able to find you by putting their credit card and no one had to talk to them, then that's your DNA today. It doesn't mean you won't go up market later like a Slack or a Canva, but if you can get them all to do that and you never have to talk to them, then get really good at viral loops, get really good at almost B2C type motions, get really good at this kind of stuff and hire growth hackers and do the whole almost B2C-ish motion, which we have at self-serve, but if your first 10 customers come in and say, "You know what, Lenny, I'll pay you $5,000, but you've got to solve this problem I have with online video," that is not a self-serve motion. It is not a self-serve motion.

(00:09:51):
Even worse, sometimes worse is your first 10 customers, five of them sign up online, but it takes a huge amount of effort for 19 bucks a month, and then five say they'll pay you $5,000 a month. Some founders are like, "I'm going to work on the five that pay us 20 bucks a month, not the five that'll pay us $5,000 a year." I find too many folks that don't like sales, too many folks that have not had any life experience in a sales-led environment flee from those customers, and I've never seen that lead to success. We're surprised who our niche is sometimes. We talk about nailing our niche, but sometimes we're surprised that niche that finds us.

Lenny (00:10:28):
There's a lot of startups I've invested in that start off product-led growth and quickly realized, "This just isn't working," and many of them move to, "We need to actually hire salespeople and start to go top down."

Jason Lemkin (00:10:40):
Most companies are a hybrid. Even there's weird hybrids like there's folks like Mongo and Snowflake. Mongo has, well, maybe Mongo's much better example, Mongo has a free low end version, and there's open source too. It's a little confusing, and then there's not a lot in the middle, and then there's a lot of big. There's all different ways to combine a product-led or self-serve motion with sales-led. Too many founders in the beginning think it's either or. It's not either or. 

Lenny (00:11:06):
So I think the big takeaway here is sales is not a question of if you're going to need a sales team, it's a matter of when. The Canva example is crazy. Maybe that's the [inaudible 00:11:16]

Jason Lemkin (00:11:16):
But they still have one. But they still have one now. 

Lenny (00:11:18):
They still have one. I think Notion, I think at 10 million ARRs when they hired their first salesperson.

Jason Lemkin (00:11:23):
That makes sense.

Lenny (00:11:23):
So I think the question that leads to is, what is a sign that you should start to hire your first salesperson?

Jason Lemkin (00:11:31):
Even if you hate sales, even if you think it's icky, even if you don't like it, as a founder you've, 95 times out of 100, you've got to find a way at least to close the first 10 customers yourself. You've got to find a way. We could dig into how to do that if you don't like sales. The hack though is that even if you don't like sales, customers love to talk to the CEO. The customers love it. Here's the other thing, as a founder, you're really good at the product in the market, hopefully even in the early days. So what's important is even if you don't know how to do outbound, even if you don't know how to send a cold email, even if you don't how to do any of this stuff, and even if you don't know how to ask for a check, even if you don't know how to open or close, almost all founders are A+ middlers, A+ middlers, A+ middlers. Before we started, you and I talked about podcasts and content, and immediately it was an A+ conversation. Maybe you don't know how to close a big sponsor, I'm just making that up, and maybe you don't know how to find one, but once you have someone in your spider web, letting the conversation, you and I just had was A+, and any founder should be there by day one, by day one, and prospects love it. 

(00:12:40):
If I want to buy CRM, I don't get to talk to Yamini at HubSpot or Marc Benioff, but I get to talk to you and your CRM company. It's magical for early adopters. So bear in mind, no matter how bad you think you are as a founder, you're pretty good at the middle part of sales. So find a way to get any prospects, get really good at the middle, and then work up your courage. Work up your courage, and find how to ask for next steps and money. What would it take, Lenny? How can we get going on Riverside? What would it take? We would love to have you. What would it take to get you going next week? You've got to learn that little motion, but you don't have to learn all the stuff you think is smarmy other than how to go from middle to just ask for how we can get going.

Lenny (00:13:19):
I like this term, middlers. So just to make sure I understand what that means, in the middle of the conversation, you're not great at initiating, you're not great at closing, but you could talk about it.

Jason Lemkin (00:13:27):
Yeah, and this is where sales reps are terrible. Most sales reps, once you go beyond the five basic questions, they can't tell you how a database works or how to eliminate hallucinations from your product or how to do payroll in Eastern Southern Guam. The sales rep, and we can talk about this, they need help. They need help from the founders in the early days. They need help from sales engineers or product people, which is my favorite place to get the help as you scale, but they need help. 

(00:13:56):
The beauty to founders is they don't need help in the middle. You can be 10 times better in the middle than any sales rep at your bigger competitor. If you're running, I am just making up CRM, but if you're running a new CRM startup, you can run circles around 98% of the sales reps at Salesforce or HubSpot. They have the brand, they have the partners, they have the integrations, but they cannot answer the questions you can answer.

Lenny (00:14:21):
Okay. So you close the first 10 customers. What are other signs that, "Okay. Now is really the time we need to start hiring sales"?

Jason Lemkin (00:14:26):
I think as soon as you've got those 10 customers and more than 20% of your time is booked up with customers, you need leverage. You need leverage. You've got to get ... If you do it too early, if you're not spending 20% of your time in sales and 20% of your time in recruiting, you're failing as a founder. You need 20% of each, 20% in sales and 20% recruiting. Nothing else really matters at some level as a CEO, maybe not as founders, but as CEOs. Once you cross the 20%, you need leverage or your calendar will die. So you need to hire one rep and you've got to hire two because otherwise, there's no A-B test. You have to A-B test humans. You have to A-B test humans. You've got to hire two as hard as it is, and there's just one cheat code to those first two. There's one cheat code. 

(00:15:13):
I talked to so many founders that screwed up their first sales hires, and they always nod when they hear it. Those first couple reps have to be people you would buy your own product from. That's it. Now we can talk about other criteria. We can talk about normalizing for deal size. We can talk about industry expertise. We can talk about all this kind of stuff, but when you go out as a first time founder and interview 30 reps, and you're going to have to interview 30, and 20 are just going to break your brain because they don't do any work and they don't do any prep and they didn't even go to your website. Then eight of the next 10 are okay, but you know it's not really going to work, but you might hire them if you get tired.

(00:15:50):
If you're lucky, one or two of them, they're like magicians. They ask the right questions, which we could talk about. Then take a pause and say, "Look, no matter how strange their background was, whatever they did, it's not the right background. It's not our same deal size. It's not our industry. They actually weren't very good at their last job. They got let go at their last job, but I would buy from Lenny. I know. I've been doing this for a year. Every day, I would buy from Lenny because Lenny just explained to me my product and my customer's problems in a way that I actually believe. Forget about what's on her LinkedIn or his LinkedIn. I would buy from Lenny." 

(00:16:23):
That rep always works because you can trust them with those leads. Almost every first time founder hires someone because they worked at Twilio or CloudFlare or wherever, and they talk the talk and they can say ACV and NRR, and they can talk all these acronyms. None of which matter. None of which matter. We all get attracted to logos on our resume, but in our gut, I always ask them, "Did you know that Jason was going to ... Would you buy from Jason?" They're like, "You're right. I wouldn't have bought from Jason, but he worked at Twilio." So just wait, wait and interview 30 sales reps, however you find them through LinkedIn, through use recruiters, use contingent recruiters. It's exhausting. Do everything. Work your network and then be flexible in the beginning. We're looking for pirates and romantics in the early days. We are not looking for folks with massive sales operations teams and enablement teams. You're looking for that quirky one that's got a few extra IQ points, that for reasons that make no sense has fallen in love with your little product that is so feature poor and does nothing, but they love it, they love it, they love it. 

(00:17:28):
My first rep I had this back in the day, he had gotten let go by a prior startup and he was struggling and he was living in his brother's garage at the time. This was not your number one person at Snowflake, but of all the 30, he came in and what's now Adobe sign? EchoSign. He described the whole problem. He described how we would solve the problem for our customers in the early days of this category. It was clear, whatever it took we needed him and whatever we needed to backfill the garage or whatever, this was the only one that could sell the product, and he did it for a decade. Closed our first five-figure deal, first six-figure deal, first seven-figure TCV deal. Didn't scale completely. Inside of Adobe was harder to scale inside of a 20,000 person company than it was in a six-person company, but he was still there. He still made that far to the journey, but he was the only one that I knew that I would buy my product from, not that I would buy something from, but I would buy my product from. 

(00:18:24):
Leads are so precious in the early days. It's so hard to find leads. That's the problem. You hire this perfect person from Snowflake and you have three leads a month and you give him two and he doesn't close them, your company's going to die. Leads are so precious. That's what folks don't get. So wait, and I know it's painful, and I know most founders have hired this person with the right LinkedIn that they wouldn't buy their product from. Just keep interviewing. You need that quirky pyromaniac that loves your product and can sell it. They're out there.

Lenny (00:18:57):
Amazing advice. Wow. There's so much there. I'm going to follow a couple threads there. In terms of the level, I know a lot of people make the mistake of going with a VP of sales pretty quickly. What's your advice? I know you talked about general attributes, but what's your advice for the level and seniority of these first two hires?

Jason Lemkin (00:19:14):
Two things, one that's evergreen and one that's maybe especially apropos for today's environment. The evergreen one, which I've talked about for over a decade, and I think folks that have been through it will see it, which is you need two sales reps hitting quota closing deals before you're ready to hire a manager for them. Almost all VPs of sales, their job is to take you from rep three to 300, to take you from three to 300, to take something that's just starting to repeat, a script that's just starting to work, leads that are just starting to come in. Then take Lenny and Jason, the two reps I have, as quirky as they are, they're crushing it. 

(00:19:55):
Then I'm going to hire a more heterogeneous type of person going forward. I'm going to hire the person from Cloudfare. They can't all be like Lenny and Jason, they're pretty quirky, but at least I can learn from them. What's working? What are the objections? How do we get around that feature gap? We're one year old, we're two years old. We've got a lot of feature gaps. This integration doesn't quite work. How do we box around those issues? How do we sell our 10x feature? Because if you're a startup, your product isn't very good, your software is not very good, and you have a competitor, but you have some 10x feature that is driving people to buy you something you're doing that does not exist in the marketplace.

(00:20:29):
The really good reps get insanely good at selling that, and the folks off the street, the new VPs often doesn't even understand the 10x feature. It's too subtle. It's too subtle. Why? The fact that your product is localized in Portuguese magically means you can win these deals. I'm making up something that doesn't quite make sense. So you need two reps that are hitting quota and then you hire VP of sales. If you hire it before then, you're doing a Hail Mary. It ain't going to work. It never, ever, never, ever, ever, never, ever works. You're asking them to find product market fit to be the first rep, to be the second rep and scale it all at the same time. It's mission impossible to do all four at the same time. 

(00:21:09):
So that's the biggest mistake is, Lenny, I can't get sales going at my company. I can't do it, but I raised $4 million in my C+ round. I'm going to go out and hire the VP of sales. That VP of sales will not be there in eight months. You know what else? 2 million of the four will be gone because they'll never understand the product. They will never understand. There's so many things we could talk about, but if there's one thing I could reinforce for this audience, it's that early sales team, they've got to be product gurus for your product audience. They've got to be product experts. Later as you scale, they can't be or you can't scale. 

(00:21:42):
When I started, when I came out of my own startup and started interviewing other folks, I remember I would interview a lot of folks at places like GitHub back in the day. I'd be like, "Do you have a technical background? Are you an engineer? Have you ever built any software?" They're like, "No, I don't. I don't know. I don't know," and I was like, "I was curious how you could do it," but GitHub was so well-established that it's 10 questions. It's 10 questions and grab a sales engineer. It's 10 questions and grab ... So you got to be really good at 10 and then you grab a sales engineer. That doesn't work in the early estate startups. So you've got to find these sales folks that are a bit of product savants and dropping the VP of sales in that isn't a product savant, which is a big issue. That's all mister or miss process. This is the issue. They're all mister or miss process.

(00:22:24):
So the second point I wanted to make, and I was on the fence for years of when you hire a VP of sales, do they need to carry a bag? Do they need to sell themselves or not? Does it matter? Does it matter? I wasn't sure for a long time. The reason I wasn't sure for a long time, it's not that you don't want a VP of sales carrying a bag. I do think a VP of engineering also should commit code. We can talk about that. 

Lenny (00:22:45):
Carrying a bag, meaning close sales themselves? 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:46):
Yeah, not just be a boss. 

Lenny (00:22:47):
Have a quota. 

Jason Lemkin (00:22:49):
Yeah, have a quote. The reason I was on the fence was because I was like, "Well, listen, in theory it's great, but let's say you're a hot startup and you want to go from two to six this year." So I want to add 4 million in new bookings, and let's say I can do 400K in quota per rep. That means I got to have 10 reps. She walks in with two. I'm at a race, aren't I? I got to hire eight in the next six months to hit my plan, and I got to put numbers on the board. If I'm going to out there as an individual contributor sales rep, I'm never going to hire eight people, am I? It's never going to happen. 

(00:23:20):
So I used to say I don't know if it matters, but what I've learned the last 18 to 20 months when everyone has gotten lazy, Lenny, everyone in tech has gotten lazy, is I see way too many VPs of sales that come in and never have any idea how to sell the product, never, never. They only want to be managers.

(00:23:38):
Now, whether they carry a bag or whether what they do is they join calls with the reps, whether they backfill the reps, you want your VP of sales in deals 20, 30 hours a week when they start. I see VPs of sales today start, they're in no deals. I'll go to a board meeting and a VP of sales will be there two, three months, and they'll have a look on the board. I'm like, "How's it going with Airbnb?" and they'll be like, "I don't know. I got to ask John." Doesn't know because it isn't in the deal, isn't even in the deal. So I see this too often.

(00:24:08):
Another company I'm on the board on, I really like this VP of sales a lot. He joined and six months in, sales were down from where, the new bookings were down from where they were six months before. He was honest. He's like, "The biggest problem is I feel like I didn't have time to learn this product. It's a complicated product. It's more complicated than the product I last sold, and I just didn't have time."

Lenny (00:24:29):
Jason, this conversation is going exactly how I'd hoped. There's so much actionable advice here. Let me try to summarize a little bit of the things you've said and then keep going. So let me know what I'm missing here. I'm going to try to just highlight some of the important things you mentioned. So in terms of when it makes sense to start hiring your first salesperson, a couple of things you shared is you've closed the first 10 customers on your own as founders. If you're spending more than 20% of your time on sales and you need to start creating more leverage. I'll throw in one other thing I've heard and just to tell me if this is also true, that there's a repeatable process you've created. You can sell consistently enough or you can tell someone, "Here's how I've been selling." Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:25:08):
Yeah. If you hire a VP of sales before then, it's approaching 100% chance of failure.

Lenny (00:25:13):
I see. So you can hire the first two reps before you're like, "Here's a pretty good process that has worked for me a number of times."

Jason Lemkin (00:25:19):
Yeah. Listen, as hard as it is for a lot of founders to even get their arms around, the reason is you've got to be that crummy first head of sales with them. You've got to manage those reps. You've got to be in the field with them. You've got to be figuring it out before you can hire the person. You just have to even if you're terrible at it because you're still going to be a good middler. You're still going to be a good middler.

Lenny (00:25:41):
Okay. A few more things that stood out to me. One is hire two sales reps immediately, not just one. These reps you need to interview about 30 people. Eight will be pretty good, 20 will be terrible, and two, these are people that you can see selling your product and you would buy from them. They're often very quirky and not maybe a traditional sales background. They've never been VPs of sales, essentially. They're more like AEs and things like that historically or maybe not even salespeople historically. Is that right?

Jason Lemkin (00:26:10):
I think you will regret it if you don't hire these first couple of sales reps that have a couple years of experience if you're in B2B with B2B sales. They need a couple of years of experience and they need a certain amount of maturity, and maturity is a real issue, and these are in any early hire because we just don't have time to babysit people. There's no onboarding, there's no training. So they need a couple years of experience, ideally something close to your deal size, we could chat about why, that would be nice, and enough maturity that you can trust them with that lead. You can trust them with your customer.

Lenny (00:26:43):
Okay. Then you hire a VP of sales once you're ready to go from three to 300 reps. Your advice is also give the VP of sales a bag slash a quota slash they need to be doing sales themselves in today's world.

Jason Lemkin (00:26:56):
At least for a little while. More importantly, if they don't want to, I think in today's world you got to run from them. Exactly whether they fully carry a quota, a half quota, whether they backfill the sales team, you want a salesperson. Here's the thing, Lenny, you want a ... This is going to sound silly, but it's not. Trust me on this. For anyone watching, listening, you want a head of sales that actually wants to do sales. I got to tell you, and I'm still struggling with this myself after the last three years or so, so many folks in all functions, we could talk about other functions too, but especially in sales, don't want to do sales anymore. They don't want to do it. They don't want do it. 

(00:27:39):
2021 was crazy because everything was too crazy. There's too much money, too much going on. 2022 was the knife falling. That was crazy too. 2023 was just hard. Whether it's burnout or whatever out or just too much change, I would say I've probably interviewed for different reasons, 50 VPs of sales in the last 12 months, I would say the majority don't want to do sales. It's my first screening question. That's why they got to carry a bag because it proves they actually still care about the craft. 

(00:28:12):
The best sales folks love sales. It's a craft. They love money. Yes, they love money, and that does matter. Do not hire a sales rep that doesn't like money. Trust me on this one. There's 0% chance they'll work out either, but they also like the craft. They like honing the script. They like beating the competition. They like figuring out the counterfeit. They like figuring out the weapon and the 10x feature. They like working on a team. They like hunting. They love it, but then sometimes I just think burnout is always a reality, but I just think that the last three years have been so yo-yoed, that folks are just, they're out. They're out. Don't hire them no matter how smart they are, and that's the test. 

(00:28:52):
I'll tell you, I talked with a really great VP of sales candidate that had worked with a top 10 tech company and I asked him what he wanted to do in this next role. He's like, "I've got a great team. I've got eight people that I can bring with me. We're ready to lock and load." I'm like, "Okay. Well, let me tell you one of my views in today's world is that you've got to actually visit more customers now, not less. In a distributed world, it's more important to visit customers." He lived in the East Bay in Pleasanton in the East Bay, which is maybe 20 minutes east of Oakland. He said, "I'm willing to visit customers, but I won't go as far as the peninsula in San Francisco." He's just happy at home. He's happy at home, Lenny, and he don't want to sell.

(00:29:34):
This guy has the best LinkedIn and the best references, but he don't want to sell anymore. He needs a job. He wants to be a VP of sales. I see this across the industry and I'm struggling to find answers. I think the biggest hiring ... We talked about a lot of tactical hiring mistakes that you can make today in sales. The biggest strategic mistake you can make today in sales because there's so many veterans, there's so many folks that worked at Twilio and Mongo and wherever, pick any great company you want. There's so many veterans out there, you just can't hire the ones that don't actually want to sell anymore, and there's too many, there's too many.

Lenny (00:30:06):
You mentioned that you actually just asked them in the interview. The first question is, "Do you actually want to sell?" What other questions do you ask for either ... Let's go through both. You said you have these questions that you ask for the early hires and then the VP of sales. What are some tips for people when they're interviewing these folks?

Jason Lemkin (00:30:21):
It's interesting. VP of sales or VP of product, I look for the same answer. One of the Colombo style questions I ask them, and this is so odd. It barely even counts as a question is, what do you want to do your first 30 days? What do you want to do? Actually, I usually ask, "What do you want to do your first two weeks?" In B2B, if I don't hear from the VP of sales or the VP of product that I'm going to go meet customers, out, I'm out. There's too many VPs of product too, Lenny, that don't want to meet customers anymore either. The majority of VPs of products that I interview, they don't meet customers. Every single great VP of product, chief product officer I've ever worked with in my entire career, you know what the first thing they do in the first two weeks? They're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone."

Jason Lemkin (00:31:00):
The first two weeks, they're like, "Leave me alone. I'm going to go talk to 20 customers. Leave me alone. Leave me alone, I'm going to go talk..." They don't want to sit out on meetings and look at PRDs and talk out of their navel on endless internal meetings. All the best ones, they say they just leave. They literally say, "Leave me alone. I will see you in two weeks. I'm going to go meet with 20 customers." And that's what products should do. Sales, whether it's prospects or existing customers, it can vary, but they should be like, "On my first day, I want to join five calls." 

(00:31:29):
And when you hear that story of, "I don't want to travel out of Pleasanton," or they say, here's what you're going to hear from the wrong person for anything, even up to 50 million in revenue, "I'm going to spend that first month working on process," "I'm going to spend that first month getting Salesforce up and running," "I'm going to send the first month on territory planning, Lenny, because we really, with our three reps, I really want to make sure we've nailed territories, right? Lenny will do the south, Elaine will do the east, Jason will do the west." 

(00:31:59):
When you hear process, process, process, from any, from marketing, product, sales, customer success, too, boy, it's the death of customer success. It's just... And it's not that you don't need process, it's just, it's even worse than it was than a few years ago. And I know this is going to trigger some people, but the truth is they don't want to work. They don't want to work. They don't want to work. 

(00:32:21):
I literally just got this LinkedIn email to work with me at SaaStr, from this person who'd been reading SaaStr for eight years. You're like, "I want to run account management, customer success for you. Here's what's, you're doing wrong, here's how to do it." I'm like, "Oh, this is pretty good." And I DMed her back, I'm like, "Great. To be honest, you realize that you're actually going to have to talk to customers and sponsors yourself in the beginning." No response. Just out. Just out. And that was the best one I got the last 30 days. That was the best inbound that I personally got. 

(00:32:51):
I know it sounds triggering or critical, but as founders, we have to be honest that there's this vast pool of veterans with great LinkedIns and great resumes that are so burnt out, Lenny. And let's not blame them. I know it sounds like I'm blaming them or being negative, and I'm trying to not be negative. I'm empathetic. I am empathetic to the burnout, but don't, you can't hire these. There's too many. 

(00:33:14):
The industry is littered with the burnt out. They're littered with it. And if you hear a touch of cynicism, if you hear anger, if you hear, "I don't want to meet customers in any..." and I'm going to say any VP role, product, sales, marketing, customers... If they don't want to meet customers their first, let's make it a 14-day test, you know they're never going to want to meet customers.

Lenny (00:33:33):
These folks that don't want to do sales that are VPs of sales, I imagine when you're further along, that's more, okay, because you don't need them to be doing sales, right? They want to manage, optimize. No. I see you shaking your head?

Jason Lemkin (00:33:46):
I mean, okay, you think, okay, there's an element, let's call it north of 50 or 100 million, where for, what's sometimes called commercial sales, SMB sales, it really is all process. Okay? So for sure, I agree. But at Salesforce, they're trying to close $100-million-plus deals. You think that the sales leadership doesn't need to be in those deals? You think they can just hit refresh on the dashboards and track them from home? No. Marc Benioff today is still flying to meet customers. He said the other day, why does Marc Benioff go to Davos? He sits, and I've never been to Davos. He sits at the same place, at the top of some staircase. Okay? 

(00:34:26):
And Salesforce drops millions of dollars, and he waits to meet customers, prospects, and partners in person all day, because it's efficient. Because it's efficient. Because he can do 50 or 100 customer or prospect meetings a day at Davos. He's still doing it at 30-something billion in revenue. Right? So this idea that, is there some truth at... For example, when I worked at Adobe back in the day, it is true that Adobe, which was, parts of the business, sales literally was dashboards. I get it. Okay, at four billion, 10 billion in revenue, but most of your audience is not ready to hire at four billion or 10 billion in revenue. They're not ready to hire that person. Don't hire them, right?

Lenny (00:35:08):
I don't know, maybe Satya's listening. You never know.

Jason Lemkin (00:35:12):
I think on the sales side of the business, they're flying out to the big deals?

Lenny (00:35:17):
To close the loop on this thread, when you're interviewing the early sales reps, those first two quirky folks, what are some questions and ways to know if there may be a good fit? You mentioned one of, you feel like you would buy from them?

Jason Lemkin (00:35:30):
Okay. The one, really, the simplest one, and early in my career, I thought this was silly or hated it, this Glengarry Glen Ross. I don't know if it was Glengarry Glen Ross or that toxic Leo movie about sales, which is still entertaining. Yeah, one way or another, Lenny, it's got to be, "Sell me this pen." But it's not "Sell me this pen," it's "Sell me this app." So I don't like surprises, I don't like games. I like to do this in a second interview or whatever. Give them time. And I don't like to judge too harshly, but whether it's the first interview or the second, they got to sell you this pen. They've got to put in the 30 minutes of work and maybe it's two hours.

(00:36:07):
But here's the thing, today's world, you can go on YouTube or someone's website... There's an explainer video for every product under the sun, isn't there? I am shocked how many salespeople I have met, Lenny, from SDR to SEB of sales that, by the time... And I'm doing an interview for a portfolio company, this isn't a screener interview, they haven't even watched an explainer video yet. I could be the fifth or eighth interview, and they don't know how the product works. They have not even gone to the effort of searching YouTube or the homepage and watching it. 

(00:36:38):
And forget about explainer videos enough. But so many companies do webinars now and they publish them on the... Really good stuff, customer testimonials. Right? If you're a sales rep, you don't actually have to know how the webhooks work or how to provision an API key, but you need to know the product as well as that webinar that's on YouTube. And 98 out of 100 folks won't bother in an interview. They won't bother. They're just going to click on "Apply" on the ATS and tell you, "Hey, I recently stumbled upon whatever. It looks like... Do you have time to discuss." Right?

(00:37:10):
But that one that actually does enough work and watches the video, and then can sell it to you, and they're going to make mistakes. They're not going to get it right, but they have enough confidence with the core problem to be solved. Because here's the mistake that 99% of founders and sales reps make. We're not really selling in B2B. We're solving problems. And this is why so many people are struggling in 2024, because they can't... their products, as sales reps, as companies, they can't solve big problems anymore. 

(00:37:41):
Our job as sales reps in SaaS is to not sell a used car, okay? We are selling a Tesla Model 3 performance. It has competition. I might not need it this week, but it's pretty darn good. And I'm going to help you understand, Lenny, because you're in the market for the car, why this is the best one. I'm going to be honest about where it's not. I'm going to answer all your questions. I'm such an expert, and then I'm going to ask you, Lenny, when is that... You have 280,000 miles on the Civic? Let me help you get you into that Model 3 performance today. And I've even got a special discount for the end of this month. And let me just help you."

(00:38:14):
And I've spent four calls answering all your questions and I'm explained to you all the things and why the supercharging network is better than the regular one that doesn't really work at the charger near your house. And I've gone on Google and I've seen there's no charging network near your house, there's only supercharges. I got you, don't I? And that's the job of SaaS and sales, because we're not selling commodities. And that's why the best reps will also tell reps when not to buy their product. 

(00:38:41):
As painful as that seems in tougher times, in 2024, the best reps say, "No, we're not there yet. We're not the right... If you need this feature, if you need this integration, I want you back in six months when you use this big product that isn't that great. But today, we're not the right solution for you." That's, the best ones do that. They have the confidence to know to close it. And the rest of the world thinks this is some sort of adversarial transactional thing and it's not. Right? 

(00:39:07):
Software... I think hopefully all your audience would agree, when it's done right, software's magical. It solves incredible problems, incredible problems. What Airbnb does, what Uber does, what SaaS... Things solve... I can track my customers, I can manage, I can automate my communications. It's magical. You shouldn't have to use boiler room tactics and use [inaudible 00:39:30] tactics when you have something. But, it doesn't sell itself, except for a little while in late 2020, early 2021, that screwed the whole world up when products actually sold themselves.

Lenny (00:39:42):
I feel like this is a separate podcast we should do of just how to get better at sales and how to sell. But, I feel like that's its own hour of conversation. I did a great episode with April Dunford where, I don't know if you follow her stuff, but she-

Jason Lemkin (00:39:54):
Yes. 

Lenny (00:39:54):
... essentially describes exactly your approach of help people understand the market, help them understand the entire landscape, and then talk about your problem. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. Has a lot of good advice there. In terms of this interview, selling-me-a-pen approach, to give people something very concrete to do. How do you actually set this up? Is it like, "Sell me your product," and then they put together a pitch for your team and they pitch you on a product?

Jason Lemkin (00:40:19):
I'll tell you, until the boom, until everyone in late 2020 got so desperate to hire anyone with a pulse, almost everyone in sales had to come and they had, during an interview process, they actually had to do the pitch. They would come and you used to do it in person with this screen. You can do it on Zoom now, it really doesn't matter, but do it for real. Do it for real, and everyone would see. And everyone in recruiting change, people stopped doing reference checks, they stopped doing these tests, and they would just hire warm bodies.

(00:40:51):
Late 2020, I can tell you a funny story in a second, and it was okay until it wasn't. And our hiring processes have not reverted back to pre-March, 2020, and I think it's failing founders left and right. I can't tell you, I would say 95% of the hiring I see out there, people don't do reference checks anymore, Lenny. And we can talk about when they work and when they don't, but no one does them. No one does them. You're going to invest so much... Forget about the salary, it doesn't really matter. So much time, your time, your leads, everything's so precious, to bring Jason into your company and you're going to go through all this recruiting process and you're not even going to do any reference checks? People don't even do reference checks.

(00:41:33):
And they don't, they stopped doing, "Do me this demo," because they were so worried the rep would go to Gusto or would go to Deal, or would go to remote. There was no time. I got to get... This SDR has 50 offers. Lenny, we got to hire this SDR with three weeks of experience. We've got to decide today. And that's the way, and hiring does not come back. If those hires bounce, not only is it bad for you, but it's a disservice to the... It's worse for the hire. I mean, that poor CloudFlare woman that blew up with the thing, there's so many issues there we could dig into, but it's all Cloudflare fault for hiring her. Okay, let's forget about that she didn't close a single deal. Okay, so objectively, in sales, should you retain your job in sales if you can't close a single deal? I don't want to get into some of the triggering things, but remember, if you hire someone and they fail, it's all your fault. She didn't know what she was getting herself into. No candidates can do enough diligence ever. There's not enough time. There isn't enough time. 

(00:42:32):
And this is true all the way to the top. And so, as an investor, a board member, it's funny, when I do interviews, I do this thing, I try to be the last interview sometimes, and the founders don't want me to do it. They want me to sell. I don't want to be the last one. And what I want to do is when, Lenny, you've decided to join Ellen at her startup, right? At the end, I said, "Look, Lenny, I've talked to Ellen, she loves you. You have the job. You've got the job. What I don't want you to do, Lenny is bouncing three months after. So let's slow down, let's talk about the questions you have on your mind, and let's have a safe space where we can make sure you're going to be happy and successful there." Right? 

(00:43:09):
And sometimes even the founders get mad at me for doing this, because sometimes, the candidate bails. But I'm like, "I know you're mad at me today, but it is your fault. A hundred percent your fault if any of your hires fail. Don't blame them. And I'm guilty of this. I get upset when people start and they don't give it their all or they don't do it. I mean, what if you hired someone for your podcast and they decided, "You know what? I don't want to do the podcast this week. I'm tired. I'll do it..." You're so mad at them, but you should've seen it during the hiring process. Right?

(00:43:44):
So, tying it back, that's why you've got to do this, "Sell me this pen." You've got to, before you hire the salesperson, have them sell your product real. Do the demo. And if they need more time, give them more time. Let them watch another demo. Don't have them feel like it's a trap or spook them. Treat them the way you would like to be treated. But if you skip this step, I mean, what's the point? You're not helping them.

Lenny (00:44:09):
What I love about this process is it connects exactly to what you recommended you look for in these hires is, "Would I buy my product from these people?" So this makes a lot of sense. And you give them this assignment at home and they do work on this and they come in, right? It's not like come to the office?

Jason Lemkin (00:44:22):
If you talk to a great transactional VP of sales that's hiring tons of reps that do it, they'll make them do... If they're still doing this, they'll make you sell the pen fast in the process. They don't have time. They're doing 20 interviews a week, 30 interviews a week, you've got to sell me this pen. But if you're a founder and I'm talking about you've already talked to a bunch of candidates, you're down to one or two, make them, tell them, "Look, this isn't a trick. I'm not that great at telling my product myself, but I got to know that you're going to be happy and successful here. So do a demo for me."

(00:44:49):
And if they won't do it, they're not a salesperson. And too many people went into sales, not... The other weird thing about B2B sales in good times is actually, a lot of these folks are not really what you might think as salespeople. They can't do outbound, they can't pick up the phone. All they know how to do is to manage leads that come in and say, "I want to buy today." And you need those people, too. Okay? And I'm not saying you don't need those people, too, but that's not always what we think of as sales.

Lenny (00:45:16):
Another black box for me, and I think a lot of people with sales, is comp and quota, had actually set up their comp for early hires, and then how to actually decide on a quota. What advice do you have for figuring that out early on? What percentage is commission, what percentage is salary? All that-

Jason Lemkin (00:45:31):
Yeah, everyone gets this wrong. We worry... Look, at scale, when you're extremely mature, extremely mature, and very profitable, you really got to tweak this stuff very carefully, and we could talk about that if it's relevant. But, in the beginning, we get this all wrong. What matters is, can a sales rep close more than they take home? In the very beginning, that's all that matters. It's just you selling, right?

(00:45:58):
The first three months of a new rep, you're lucky if they can close as much as their take-home pay is, their OT. And so, in the really early days, my early, early day comp plan is, look, your first three months, you keep a hundred percent of what you close. Of course, that's not profitable for the business, but you've got to invest in them, right? You keep a hundred percent of what you close. And if you have enough going on in your business, usually, that's enough to put supper on the stove. 

Lenny (00:46:24):
And that's without a salary? 

Jason Lemkin (00:46:26):
No, no. You pick an OT, a salary, but you got to... Okay, let's step back for a minute. You got to pay market. You got to pay market. And in the early days, if you're bootstrapped or really lean, this stresses folks out. I just talked to this great rep, Lenny, but he wants 150k OTE. And in fact, it's a step down. He had 170k at Slack, but he knows this isn't a startup. He wants 100. He might take 140.

Lenny (00:46:53):
And OTE is total comp, overall total comp.

Jason Lemkin (00:46:54):
Total comp. And the founder panics. "I don't have, I'm only making 60. How can I pay 140?" Well, let's break it down for a minute. First of all, let's be tactical. It's usually 50/50, right? 50% base, 50% bonus for a sales rep. So they're really only taking home a 70k base, trying to make another 70. Okay? Then 70 divided by 12, help me do my math. It's not quite 6k month. Well, maybe with taxes it is. You're really only paying 6k a month for a couple months to see if this experiment works out. You're investing 20,000, you don't have $20,000 to do sales? Then don't do sales, if you can't find $20,000. So people freak out too much about this comp-line number, this base and bonus, the on-target earnings, OTE, and they're not more practical about what am I committing to cash upfront? 

(00:47:44):
Two, you need a plan where it's a win-win. So if this person makes 140, but ultimately, a sales rep's got to bring in four to five times what they take home. That 140's got to be 500, 600 or more. The more enterprise you are, the bigger the multiple has to be, and the higher the comp. But it's got to be 3x to 5x at a minimum, 3x for small businesses, 4x for mid-market, 5... You got to get there, but you don't have to be there on day one and two. When you get there, the reps should be accretive, shouldn't they be? If they make 150 and they bring in 450, unless your marketing costs are out of control, which can happen, but that's not sales fault is it? If your marketing costs are reasonable and you pay a sales rep 150 for closing 450, if you engineer your plan right, you should be smiling, not frowning.

(00:48:34):
Where it gets tough is when you have a ton of folks not closing. When you have a ton of folks not closing and you have extremely high marketing costs, then it all breaks. Your cap breaks, your payback period breaks. But, if you have inbound leads, if you have demand, and you have sales reps that can sell you this pen, they're going to be accretive, Lenny, because of that math. And take the pressure off, don't make them close 5x their take on their first quarter, make them close 1x. Let them put points on board, let them eat. And so negotiating, here's the point if you think about it. Negotiating someone down from a 150k OTE to 130, it's not going to make any difference. You want them to close 600 or 700. It's not going to matter. 

(00:49:15):
At scale, does it matter? For Mongo maybe. Maybe. But, what you care about is how much more can they close and they bring in? And then you, that's why you want them to make a lot of money. You want them to be rich. You want them to take home a lot for a whole bunch of reasons. And so, don't freak out about the acronym OTE, what they take home. Figure out what it's really going to cost you and would you buy from them? And if you would, they're probably going to bring in more than they take home. Right? And on the marketing side, in early days, you're lucky if you can find a marketing channel that is that accretive.

Lenny (00:49:49):
Amazing. Okay. So just to summarize, you start a sales person with, say, 75k in salary and then say 75k in expected sales. And they take-

Jason Lemkin (00:50:01):
Bonus, bonus.

Lenny (00:50:02):
Bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:04):
Bonus from sales, yep. 

Lenny (00:50:05):
Bonus from sales and the the idea there is they take 100% initially of their sales, for the first month or two, just to make it feel amazing. They're making money. See how they're doing, don't put a lot of pressure on them. And then the plan is, over time, get it to a point where they're bringing into the business four to five times what they're taking home in terms of bonus.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:24):
Yeah, yeah. 

Lenny (00:50:25):
I set expectations every month or two, or is it every quarter? We're going to revisit your comp and quota and adjust.

Jason Lemkin (00:50:32):
If you get it right, you never have to revisit it. Not for years. I mean, I'm using the same sales comp plan I have for a lot of years. It still works. Listen, you can make tweaks and you've got to listen, and we're all human beings. And people, and again, remember, your sales team has to eat. They've got to eat, okay? And you've got to be somewhat competitive. But, there's only so much you can tweak, Lenny. I mean, they have to bring, close more than they bring home. Right?

(00:50:55):
And so, you can make tweaks at the margin. The problem is if you make too many tweaks to this model, you burn up all the cash. You're trying to plug a leaky boat, there's no point. There's no point. There's no point. And remember, related to this, for a long time, for most folks, unless you're, even if you're hyper funded, you're better off with fewer, better reps than more reps.

(00:51:18):
There is a stage when you get big enough where this concept of capacity planning really does matter. Lenny, if I got to go from 50 to 100 this year, okay? I'm going to add 50 million. If each of my reps can do 500k, I need a hundred, don't I? Okay. And literally, if you have 20, you mathematically cannot hit the plan. So there's a certain truth at scale. In the early days, this is a rookie error. I'd much rather have two reps, each closing a million than 20 reps struggling to close 100k each. Culturally, it's terrible. There's no domain knowledge in the company. Everyone's miserable, everyone's fighting. 

(00:51:50):
What you want to do in the early days is concentrate your leads and your best closers, at the same time, bringing new people up. But you've got to concentrate your leads to your best closers. And that means year two, year three, year four, they should be making a lot of money. Lot of money, sometimes too much. I remember the first investment I ever made was a company called Pipedrive, which sold for a billion and a half. SMB CRM, and I put in the first sales rep there. He used to work for me. And the founders got mad at him. They got mad at him, because in three months, he was making more than any of the founders. They were pissed. 

(00:52:21):
I'm like, "Guys, I know we're have different backgrounds and cultures, but this is what you want." But it took them a long time culturally as self-serve... Because Pipedrive was 100% self-serve at the time. They'd never had a sales rep. And I put the guy in, and what he did was he went and he looked, all these self-serve customers, he's like, this was the company was about two million revenue at the time. And he's like, "Okay, who's bought more than one seat?" He just did a reverse sort and he called them. 

(00:52:48):
I remember he called AOL back in the day and he's like, "You guys have 20 seats of Pipedrive. Would you like to buy more for your sales team?" They're like, "Thank you very much. We'll take 100 seats." And he just went down the list, from the top to the bottom, and he took home 20% of those deals. Now that difference, that extra 80 seats at AOL, he brought it in. So Kim, keeping 20% of that is a great deal for the company, right? But he was pretty good at it and he was the only person for a while, so he made hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars when the poor company, the founders were paying themselves 50.

Lenny (00:53:20):
So your advice there is don't be sad if your salesperson is making tons of money.

Jason Lemkin (00:53:25):
If you architect the simple sales fund we talked about, and they're making a lot of money, you're making a lot of money, and your equity is worth a lot of money, your equity is worth a lot of money. Right?

Lenny (00:53:34):
When do you make that switch from they're taking home 100% of what they're selling to smaller percentage?

Jason Lemkin (00:53:40):
Look, some people are going to think it's goofy what I said about 100. I just view it as a simple ramp. I think you do it for one quarter max. One quarter. The problem is if you let this go for too long, more than a quarter, if you make it too easy for long a quarter, the problem is the mediocre lean into it too much, and that doesn't help. And not only does it not help you, it doesn't help them. You don't want to make mishires. They're so damn... I mean, you could have a whole podcast only just on mishires. It's probably the single most important thing in scaling startups. It's not hires, it's mishires.

(00:54:12):
It's a tragedy if you mis-hire a rep, but you don't want them there six months. It's not good for them either. You want to support them, you want to help them find a place where they're successful. And here's the quirky thing on the mishires, and this is why that first guy I hired was mid-pack. He was less than mid-pack. Here's the thing about sales is, someone can be very good in certain sales environments and completely fail in other ones, completely fail. It's probably more binary than any other function. And so you got to find it before you hire them, but you also got to root it out fast, because those leads are too precious.

(00:54:44):
And it doesn't mean they won't go on to another company and be wildly successful, but you could utterly fail. And the one related point I'll give, if I had to throw one hint on this first, any of these reps, first 10 and VP of sales, one hint more than anything else, trust... got to hire someone whose last product was harder to sell. This is so important. This is a recipe for utter disaster. If you've, take someone in sales and their last product was easier to sell, they will have none of the skills to sell your product. But, this is the... and I'll give you an example in a second. 

(00:55:27):
If you hire someone from something that was just a smidge harder, a smidge harder to sell, and they come into your company, it's like they're on Mars. It's like weight has been released from their feet. They learned how to sell a harder product and get it done, and then they come to you. And the first example I had, the first SDR I hired was a guy named Sam Blond, who went on to be CRO at Brex, and then now is a partner at Founders Fund. We worked together from the very beginning, first SDR. And he came, before that, he was an SDR at a company called Intacct, which was bought for a billion, which was online financials. Okay?

(00:56:03):
And back in the day, we know what the one thing people didn't want to put in their cloud was? Their financial statements, okay? It just wasn't trusted that. There are some things you would trust to the cloud, like A CRM, but they'd be like, "These are my crown jewels. I can't put these..." So he went from desperately trying to convince folks to move a business process to the cloud. They had no interest. And he came to us, and it was hard, but it wasn't that hard. And he instantly was number one. He went from SDR to SMB-AE to mid-market AE to director of sales, to head of this whole sale... 

(00:56:31):
Because, I mean, there are many reasons he was great, but he came to me and I said, "Sam, why are you crushing it when everyone else here is struggling?" He's like, "This is much easier than Intacct." So hire someone like that and don't make... No matter how much you like them, the sell me this pen thing will control for it a bit, okay? But, when we give, we give, we give in the hiring process. We never give what we want. Be very, very careful if the last product was easier to sell.

Lenny (00:56:57):
I love this advice. What is a heuristic that the last product was harder to sell than yours? What tells you that that's probably true?

Jason Lemkin (00:57:04):
Be very careful if it was more technical, very technical. Some folks can go from a business process sale. They can go from selling a Gong or a sales software and outreach, and they can go sell a complicated API to VPs of engineering or VPs of product, but most can't. Okay? So more technical is a tough heuristic. More competitive is a positive. What really works, Lenny, is if you hire someone from the number four in the space and they did well. You take someone that was number four in the space and then you're number two in the space? You think number two's really hard because number one's crushing you? But they're at number four in a space where no one can tell the difference between these products? That's a great one, right? So a space that's more competitive, a space that is a positive, more technical.

(00:57:55):
The other one related to technical, on the pure B2B side, is much more complicated business process. I see folks fail in B2B when they've sold us... Yeah, it's hard, but they've sold a simple business process. They go to something that's got a lot of integrations, a lot of complexity, and a lot of business process change, and they just melt because it's too complicated. They just melt, right? There's a company I invested in, it's doing over 20 million today. And for some reason, to simplify what they do, which is pretty complicated, they called it the Gong for X. Okay? The Gong for X.

(00:58:30):
And it's great to get a VC meeting and a few other, but it's not even on their homepage, okay? It doesn't really make sense. And the CEO had me listen to this senior sales exec he hired, and the only thing he could tell the prospect was that they were Gong for X. And the prospect kept asking, "Well, how does this deep integration with this business process flow and Zendesk works, and how does this go over to Salesforce?" He's like, "Well, we're Gong for X." That $600,000 deal was lost. Right? 

(00:59:00):
But, maybe that works in some space, right? And Gong's hard to sell today, too, don't get me wrong. But you see my point, it's just that simplicity, it's too complicated, right? And I know it's not the perfect heuristic, other than this technical thing, but the technical one, man, trust me. Too many B2B type reps melt in B2D. They just melt. They just, selling to VP of eng is a different... It's the same beast, but they don't suffer fools, do they? Not the VP of engineerings I'm close. They don't suffer fools.

Lenny (00:59:32):
I haven't heard this term, B2D before, business to developers. 

Jason Lemkin (00:59:35):
To developer, yeah. 

Lenny (00:59:36):
I imagine that what it stands for. Oh, interesting. Haven't heard that term before. Okay, let me zoom out a bit and I want to move on to a different topic. But before we do that, so we've talked about kind of these early days of hiring your first two reps, getting your VP of sales to help scale out the team. To give people a sense of where this goes, as the business scales, what does the org evolution look like? You have these two reps doing sales on their own, then you have a manager. What does it look like over the next couple phases of the sales org?

Jason Lemkin (01:00:03):
Look, to simplify, there's rules of eight. So in sales, I'm actually not sure what the tip of heuristic is in product, because product teams are leaner, at least I hope. I like it when they're leaner. But the thing about sales is there's no efficiency. If you have a sales-led motion, half your company is going to be in sales at 10 millionaire, half your company is going to be in sales at 50, half your company is going to be in sales at 100. 

(01:00:27):
One of the tough parts of the software model is that there's no, there's actually almost anti-efficiencies in sales. The public companies are actually less, they have the higher CACs than startups, believe it or not, because they have so much market penetration. So you're going to need a lot of people. And it's rules of eight, eight SDRs, outbound reps need one manager, eight AEs, eight sales execs need a director above them.

(01:00:51):
And then when you really scale, eight directors. You don't really ever going to have eight directors, but eight directors could have a VP or eight reports. And so there's rules of eight. If you want to build an organization on it, it's all rules of eight. For a while, for SDRs, thinking this was this high velocity entry-level position, people pushed it to 12. But the more folks I talk to today, the more I hear, everyone's reverted to eight. I'd rather have fewer SDRs, having better conversations. And so it's just, you can build your whole org with eights.

Lenny (01:01:21):
That is way too easy of an answer. So the idea there is you hire this VP of sales, then you hire six more sales reps, AEs. So what happens next? You hire another-

Jason Lemkin (01:01:32):
Got to start hiring managers.

Lenny (01:01:32):
Manager, got it. Yeah. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:33):
Yeah. 

Lenny (01:01:34):
And then you scale eight more reps.

Jason Lemkin (01:01:35):
And once you have eight AEs scaled, you almost always are going to start, a VP's going to already... A good VP of sales already be hunting two directors.

Lenny (01:01:44):
Two directors. 

Jason Lemkin (01:01:45):
Whether they're just split up normally, whether they're east, west is a classic way. Another way, you might have smaller and larger customers. That's pretty standard, right? Commercial and enterprise. But a good VP of sales, once you have, she or he has eight reports, will be bringing in two directors, or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title-

Jason Lemkin (01:02:00):
... directors or maybe two VPs if they're an SVP. There's a lot of title inflation today, which doesn't bother me nearly as much as a lot of other things we've chatted about. I don't care what your title is if you'll actually do sales or do work, but yeah, we need to bring in managers at 8:00. And folks that can, also, a related point is, a lot of founders were, "When will my ... " I really love my head of sales, but she's a stretch. Most of them should be stretches.

(01:02:25):
If you hire the seasoned one, they're not going to work, so for 95 out of 100 of us, our first head of sales should be a stretch VP of Sales. And what that means is, usually, they were a director before that or a senior director or sort of a VP, okay? But you should be cautious about hiring your first VP of Sales for their first third VP of Sales gig. They're not willing to do the job anymore. You need a stretch and it's worth it for their career growth. It's worth it for their personal growth. It's worth it for the equity, right? So you're going to hire a stretch. That's an important tip right there. But then, you're going to be a little worried, how far can Lenny go? How far can ... I love Lenny, but he was a director for two years before this, and this is his first rule, and he did so good last year, but I'm worried Lenny's going to break. I'm worried Lenny's going to break.

(01:03:09):
And related to this quote, the simple answer is, Lenny will break if he can't source those directors under him. You can scale forever as a sales leader if you can hire better managers under you. And it's true of any functional area, but what you'll see in sales is, you'll see your stretch VP of Sales drown when they never can hire better managers under them, They'll end up doing some weird internal promotions, which you want, you want to do internal promotions. My rule is you want to promote 50% from within and hire 50% without for your managers, but if, really, the only people you can promote are just junior people on your team, you can't find leaders, you can't scale. I do see this happen too frequently is, a first time out of sales, does it, and then, they're like, "Here are my managers, Lorraine and Jason, but they really were just reps for two years and they don't know how to do it." So you have a whole bunch of people who don't know how to do it. That's when the organization cracks.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2x to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in.

(01:05:11):
Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.

(01:05:26):
There's these terms that we throw, around account executive reps. It might be helpful just to give people a sense of what does this actually mean when someone's an account executive. Is it that they're just sitting there calling and doing sales directly? Whatever the key terms are for the roles or the title might be helpful to quickly summarize.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:42):
Yeah, I think the two ones that are probably less obvious for folks that are new are SDR, Sales development representative, and AE, account executive.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Okay, great.

Jason Lemkin (01:05:49):
And SDR is, generally, although I wish it wasn't, it is generally an entry level position, often fresh out of school, generally paid on the order of 60K to 80K, OTE and SaaS and US-based SaaS, and their job is to email for dollars, dial for dollars, and in many cases, to screen, to screen inbound leads. It's entry level, and their job is to pass on a lead to a sales executive, an account executive, an AE. Not all companies have SDRs. It's a longer topic, but pretty much all the best teams have some type of SDR function now because we've learned we want to specialize. We want openers opening and we want closers closing, so that's the rough idea.

(01:06:34):
SDRs are openers in some cases, and account executives are the more seasoned folks closing. And it varies, compensation from account executives that are US-based could be anywhere from like 90K to 200K, depending on, that's with base and bonus split at 50/50, depending on whether they're hunting tiny deals or big ones. That's the way an account executive works. And I think what doesn't happen today ... Those are the acronyms, SDR and AE. I think people can figure out VP of Sales, that's vice president of sales.

(01:07:03):
I think a thing that's gone on in the industry that founders expect now because there's so much discussion of it on LinkedIn and social media, but I haven't found work, is that an account executive will magically be full stack. They will do outbound themselves, they'll go use ZoomInfo and Apollo and develop a list themselves, they'll manage that outbound list themselves. If they don't have enough inbound, in their free time, you know what they'll do, Lenny, in their free time? They'll just do more outbound. You know what sales reps do in their free time? Today, they sell real estate or courses.

(01:07:36):
If you want a tip, for founders, I know you want this full stack AE, and they do exist when they're micromanaged in certain high performance sales organizations, but they don't exist in real life. They're specialized. Most AEs, they want to be closers, they want to be handed a lead, a contact me, a lead. They want to work the lead and close the lead, and you hire some SDRs to help generate more demand. Those are the basic acronyms. What's hard for most founders, here's the tough part, most founders have enough stamina to manage a couple of these AEs, these account executives, these folks who work the leads. Most founders do not have the stamina to manage 10 kids fresh out of college that need to be micromanaged on an hourly basis to call leads. Very, very few founders themselves can manage a team of SDRs, but if you can, it's like a superpower.

Lenny (01:08:28):
That was really helpful. I did not know what exactly these terms represented, and when you're hiring those first two reps, they should be at the account executive level.

Jason Lemkin (01:08:37):
Yes. And they'll do some outbound and they'll do some of this SDR work. It's just, ultimately, people end up specializing.

Lenny (01:08:43):
What is the title for someone above the account executive? Is it Director of Sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:08:46):
Yeah. There's really no ... It's a meta topic. I wish there were another career path for these ICs. This does exist in product, it does exist in engineering. It should exist in sales, but the truth is it doesn't. There is no senior SDR for this outbound. And for this AE, this person closing, yes, you can go more enterprise and make more money, but there isn't really a senior AE track, but there should be. It's unfortunate. It should be.

(01:09:15):
Too many of these folks are looking for, they look to go into management for promotion when what they really should look for is to be a super IC, and it's a shame that more folks don't try to implement a super IC role in sales, but that's basically what the career path is in management. And that's why another tip, another mistake that founders often make is, they hire the number one account executive at a hot company to be their head of sales. It's not the same skills. Most sales executives should not be managers. They don't want to be managers. They want to be individuals. They want to be highly paid individual contributors, these days, that mostly work from home and make a lot of money working 30 hours a week. That does not naturally breed great management skills.

Lenny (01:10:02):
I want to shift directions a little bit and talk about product and sales. A lot of listeners of this podcast are product managers or founders building products. How involved should product managers be in sales. And vice versa, how involved should sales be in the roadmap and what's being built?

Jason Lemkin (01:10:19):
I think, in the best run B2B organizations that I've worked with, and my own as well, the great, at least the head of product, the VP of Products, are deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. Deeply involved in sales. A company I invested in that's just crossing $60 million, they just had a meeting with who will be their largest customer. And the head of product who was there at the board meeting is like, "Thank God I was there because what they want to do with our product, we sort of do. We sort of." Now, the product does do it, but what they want to basically do is deconstruct the product. They don't actually want to use the backend and analytics and some other pieces, but they don't really need the front end of the product. If the head of product hadn't been there, that deal would've been lost. It would've been lost.

(01:11:11):
An AE doesn't know that. Even if an AE did know that, a sales rep did know that even. If the VP of Sales didn't know ... A VP of Sales would not be empowered enough to stand up in a meeting and say, "I know what you want. We can launch tomorrow on this and, in 90 days, we'll tweak the UI so it does exactly what you want." You want that in your big deals. If you have that magical VP of Product that truly owns the roadmap, owns it and has the gravitas for that meeting, they become like the mini CEO in these meetings. A lot of CEOs, at scale, I've talked to, I was just talking with Daniel Chait at Greenhouse, he does this, they're over $200 million, when they have that head of product, they divide and conquer with the big customers. And the CEO can do some and the VP of product can do others.

(01:11:52):
And sometimes, the VP of Eng, if they're very producty, can also do that role too. Sometimes, you get these three weapons. In the old days, sometimes, your VP of Customer Success could do this, but unfortunately, and I know this is going to trigger some people, I don't see customer success stepping up for this pseudo product role anymore and I see them shrinking more and more into process. But that magical VP product, they give you that scale, that CEO level scale.

(01:12:17):
Can a product manager or a director do that? In my experience, the best ones, absolutely. The mid-pack ones that are working on the color of the pixel, I'd rather not have them in the deal. You have to be utterly fluent in the product, the entire product. You have to be the one that knows how to connect the pieces that don't ought to always connect themselves, and you have to have the gravitas to work with a large customer, to make commitments. That deep knowledge and commitment, it's hard below the VP level, but if it does exist, I love it. They become one of the greatest strategic weapons of a B2B company is bringing the product team, because the VP of Sales never quite goes that deep and can't make the commits, and the CEO can't be everywhere.

Lenny (01:13:04):
The bane of many product managers' existence is the flip side of sales is involvement in product. Do you have any advice for how you've seen the best SaaS companies handle requests from sales going into product, how product teams should think about requests from sales and making that work?

Jason Lemkin (01:13:21):
I think this one is so simple and I'm surprised people make it so complicated. I know we all release 28 times a day, but the reality is, software still goes on quarterly release cycles no matter what we say, okay? Your customers cannot process 88 releases a day, okay? The maximum a customer can process is two big releases a year and maybe quarterly, so let's simplify. That's how customers think. Forget about how we build software.

(01:13:46):
Every quarter, give your head of sales a certain budget, whether it's story points or 10% of the pie chart, however you do it, give them a budget. And when you do this, things will radically change then. They radically change because even the best VPs of sales, they change the wind. On Monday, what they really need is the HubSpot integration. And they're like, "Oh, my god. We weren't going to do that for two years, but I guess we could change everything on Monday," but then, on Wednesday, a new prospect comes in and, "We need SAP, but we just spent two days spec-ing out." You need SAP. And then, on Monday, it's Salesforce, right? And it's not that sales isn't honest, it's just, the big deals, the big ones always, the tail's wagging the dog and it burns out the organization. Even with the best sales leaders, I find it burns out, especially because the stressful deals, they overreact, and as good as they are, they're not product people, so they don't really know how to prioritize and force rank. If you say, "Okay, Lenny, my VP of Sales, great. HubSpot, SAP, whatever you want, you've got 10% of the budget, you've got a hundred story points, whatever metric or heuristic you use, but you've got to decide now each quarter." And if you want to change during the course of the quarter, if you want to disrupt our whole engineering product team, you can do it, but understand there's a high cost, and the later you do it in the quarter, the less successful it's going to be because we already started the HubSpot integration. Not only will it demoralize the team, but we're going to run out of ... You already used your budget.

(01:15:10):
I just don't see enough product leaders being objective here, saying, "Listen, here's your budget. You get it, period. No one can take it from you. I guess the CO can steal it if she really wants to, but it's yours, VP of Sales." And they will do the low balancing across their team. They will do it. They will listen and they'll say, "Maybe I don't need that HubSpot integration after all. Maybe." Right?

(01:15:32):
Because what a VP of Sales should be doing is taking ... The CO has to look five years into the future, product has to look about two years into the future, and you really can't ask a VP of Sales to look more than 12 months into the future because that's where they're next on the line, but a good one will load balance feature requests across the year and they will listen to all the ... Because they'll actually be in sales, they'll actually be in deals, and they'll be listening and they'll realize, look, even though we're going to lose this deal to HubSpot, I've gotten four SAP requests the last ... I'm going to take that bet. Even if I'm wrong, I'm going to take that bet. You got to give them that ... And you got to talk about it every week and say, "Look, here's your budget, Jane. Here's your story points, your whatever, your 10%. This is what we're building now for you, objectively, and this is what we're currently planning for the next two quarters. Would you like to change the ones for the next two quarters? Because we haven't committed any code yet, and if you really want to change what's in process, you can. Otherwise, it's going to be hyper disruptive," but you got to at least pretend to be objective, for sales.

(01:16:29):
If you're too emotional about it, you break the organization. You've got to say, "Listen, I know we've already written 80% of this upside integration. If you really need us to put us on the shelf and drop everything for a million dollar deal, we're a startup, we'll do it. But understand, just, is this really really what you want?" And if you involve them every week as a stakeholder, magic happens. But I don't see the VPs of Product that I work with, I know I'm not in all the staff meetings, but the meetings I'm in and the board meetings, I don't see this back and forth happening.

Lenny (01:16:58):
This might be the same exact answer you just gave, but say you're a PM and a salesperson comes to you, "Hey, we're about to close this deal. We just need this one feature. Can we just get this on the roadmap?," what's the best way to help that sales person understand why it's not happening, help them feel like, "Okay, I get it"? Is it exactly what just said? "Okay, we could change everything. Here's the story points you have this quarter."

Jason Lemkin (01:17:18):
Well, are you assuming that PM is the head of product or empowered enough to make the decisions?

Lenny (01:17:24):
I'd say, yeah, that PM could put something on the roadmap if they think it's important.

Jason Lemkin (01:17:29):
The reason I'm a little confused, just because I want to get it right, is what I'm hearing, which maybe isn't what you said. What I'm hearing is, a junior IC rep is talking to a more mid-level product person about the roadmap, and you want to have that. That's one of the reasons we actually go to the office. Because those discussions don't happen on Zoom, Lenny. They don't happen. And you want those discussions to happen, but you don't actually want them empowered. You want them to say, "Listen, I will talk to my boss." That's the right answer. It's too confusing.

(01:17:58):
This stress between product and sales is a good thing. It's a sign of a well-run B2B company when there is stress between product and sales. It's a good sign. If there's no stress, you're not in enough deals. You're not in enough deals if there's no stress. But the stress has to have enough process, even in a startup, that it doesn't break because your question alludes to the fact it can break organizations again and again. People get people resented on either side.

(01:18:27):
This is one thing where the answer has to be, "Look, we can chat about it over lunch. We can chat about this, and actually, you've got a good idea. You're an individual contributor. I'm going to tell my boss, on Monday, that I think we should do that. I'm going to use a little social capital and say we should do this," but you got to push the decisions up. That's as far as you're going to make recommendations. Otherwise, instead of that one stressful conversation with the VP, you've got a hundred, you've got 10 times a hundred, and again, they're fun lunch conversations, but they'll wreck you.

Lenny (01:18:54):
So the advice there is, basically, "Talk to your manager, I'll talk to my manager. They need to hash this out. It's not my call."

Jason Lemkin (01:19:00):
I think you got to push it up and I think you got to force the VP of Sales and the VP of Product to have this weekly meeting about the budget, and that will force them to have enough, just enough organization on their team so that it can all be surfaced up. Because that means they each have to have a meeting with their team for 30 minutes each week and say, "I'm going to put up on the whiteboard guys, so my sales team's going to say ... And I've been to many of these meetings where you force the sales team to force rank what they want and you end up, I tell you, Lenny, 100% of the time in the sales meeting, when you do a whiteboard force rank, you end up walking out with very different outputs than when you start the meeting in sales 100% of the time.

(01:19:36):
On the product side, you need to do the converse. You just need to say, "We owe sales 10% of our points, so in our team meeting, we're going to put in 15 minutes of our team meeting and we're going to make sure we have the priorities right from the sales team. Let's go over what I got from Linda. This is what she says. Is she wrong? Should we do something? How can we help the sales team be even more successful? And what inputs is the team hearing?" And they can raise their hand and say, "Look, I just had this all the way conversation with Bobby, but honestly, Lenny, I can build a HubSpot integration in a day." "What? I thought it was really hard." "No, I did it my last company. And listen, actually, we can actually outsource it to Bob and Linda at this agency I know for 20 grand. They'll build it next week." That's a magical moment. That's a magical moment. But you've got to each have these parallel meetings. The good thing, that tension can become debilitating. We've all seen those fights, those almost fights that break out, and they come from a place of passion, but you got to have structure.

Lenny (01:20:30):
Great advice. Another trend I've been noticing is that product teams are taking on P&L responsibilities and revenue goals. What's your sense of, is that good? Is that bad? How do you think about that for product teams?

Jason Lemkin (01:20:42):
You want everyone to be aligned on the big picture revenue goal for the end of the year. Is the question, you mean having financial bonuses and stuff tied to hitting the plan?

Lenny (01:20:51):
More that their KPIs and their OKRs are essentially this much revenue, you need to drive this much revenue from your experiments, from your product launches.

Jason Lemkin (01:21:00):
As you can see, I have a lot of opinions on things here that are data-driven and they're live experience. This one, I need another year in the oven, and I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. What happened in the last 18 months is, in customer success, which is, in the old days, it was related to product. Now, it's less so, which I think is unfortunate. In customer success, in the last 18 months, this happened all across the industry. 24 months ago, customer success's goal was happy customers, measured in retention, sometimes NRR, net retention with upsells, sometimes with GRR, just logos, how many logos. That was your only job, happy customers. Happy customers.

(01:21:35):
Then, things got harder in many areas of B2B, and every customer success team last year, their goal was revenue. You need to bring in more revenue from existing base, and it destroyed customer relationships. There is a leading public company, I will not name them, I'm a positive guy. I will tell you, a company we all have used for years and loved, and they did this to their customer success team. And they came to us last year, we paid $299 a month for this product for our team. They asked us for $50,000 upfront or said they would turn it off that day. That week. Maybe it was that week. $50,000. That's what happens when you weaponize ...

(01:22:10):
So customer success, and I know this is going to trigger some people, but it is true, when I talk to leaders, customer success got weaponized and I don't like it, okay? I don't like it as a product. All founders are product people, I think. I don't like it as a product because I think it's bad for customers. That experience I got was horrific, wasn't it? That $50,000, being told. And it got walked back. And the fact that it got walked back is almost even worse because it wasn't true. It was a threat. So do I want to weaponize the product team? I want the product team aligned with revenue. These are the tough decisions for founders. But I think we're going to regret, to some extent, weaponizing teams that we don't need to weaponize.

(01:22:50):
Having said that, I will tell you, and again, no knock on Adobe, but when I was a VP at Adobe, and it was a long time ago, when product was in another building, in some cases, that was not great. And I love Scott and the whole team, it was a great experience, but I can just tell you, what I learned is, that did not work for me as an agile guy, having groups that would do this work in isolation.

(01:23:08):
And the problem was they would never talk to a customer. So I know I want product constantly talking to the customer. I know I want the VP of product with a lot of equity, wanting to hit the bookings number for the year. Do I want your average PM weaponized and forced to bring in revenue from an experimental feature when everyone agreed it's the test we're going to run? We only can run so many. You say, should they have revenue for new feature launches, for new product expansions, for new things? Yes, but everyone's got to make that decision. There aren't that many of us that have 1,000 extra engineers sitting around with nothing to do.

(01:23:44):
Even the smallest experiment, no matter what it says on the internet, again, that we release 100 a day, I would argue bringing any product extension to market's very expensive and risky because you're taking away from something else. These are expensive decisions, and if you punish people for the mistakes in product, this is something that big companies are actually better at than startups, which is, they don't fire you if the new initiative fails. Because then, no one at a big company would ever join the new initiative. There are exceptions, but no one at Adobe or Google would work on the new product if you got fired if it didn't hit $100 million its first year.

(01:24:21):
One thing I saw that was very, and I don't know how to bring to startups in my big company experience, was it's liberating to some extent to let people fail, up to a point. It's liberating. Because the cost of failure in a startup is so high. It's just so high. I know that's not what the exact question, and ask me in a year, but my advice is, just be careful that you don't weaponize functions.

Lenny (01:24:44):
I probably should have clarified. I think this is mostly true in PLG companies where most of the growth is coming from product, but I imagine the advice is still the same, as be careful putting too much pressure on the product team to focus on revenue.

Jason Lemkin (01:24:55):
Well, that's how you get dark stuff. Back in the day, I remember my sister worked at Vistaprint for online business cards, and her entire job was to force people to buy upsell of additional products on the checkout page they didn't want to buy. That was her whole job. And she was paid a large variable comp to get people to buy third party products without realizing in their checkout, and it worked. That's all she did for three years was figure out dark stuff, I mean, darkish, grayish stuff so that when I bought my business card, I also bought GoDaddy and 11 other things that I didn't want. It works, but it doesn't create high NPS, does it?

Lenny (01:25:34):
Mm-hmm. No.

Jason Lemkin (01:25:34):
The thing is, here's the thing that you have to think about. What's crazy, Lenny, now, and I talk to a lot of these folks is, there's so many SaaS companies that are a billion or more in revenue. I just wrote up, there's just Pimcore, which is SaaS for [inaudible 01:25:49]. I just wrote up, it just crossed a billion in revenue. So many folks are at a billion. CloudFlare just crossed a billion. And the only way you can do that is if your revenue compounds.

(01:25:59):
And in fact, just myself, I just interviewed Matt Mullen from WordPress, 20 years he's been doing this, and he said the number one thing he didn't understand at WordPress, at Automatic, was the power of compounding. When you do these things that are customer hostile, and a lot of us were under stress this last 12 days, to hit the numbers, right? This is your job as founders, is you got to load balance the fact that the cash has to last and my investors are mad with me, but nothing matters in B2B that it compounds. And some of this dark stuff you're talking about on PLG, it anti-compounds, right?

(01:26:30):
And I would say, let me flip it around. The magical thing at the high level that it compounds, if you have a self-service model, a PLG model, I actually think the number one most important metric is churn. It's going to this churn, churn, churn, churn. And when I meet any startup for investing or anything, if the churn is not top decile for a low end product, I'm always out. It's almost unsolvable. It's almost unsolvable. This 3% to 4% a month churn rate that a lot of SMB stuff, it's almost unsolvable. I think that's where the energy should go, is relentlessly bringing down churn so that, 20 years from now, we all have billion dollar AR companies. That's what we want.

Lenny (01:27:11):
I have a rapid fire set of questions before, actually, the lightning round. We'll see if we have time for all these things. I just have a bunch of random questions that I'm going to fire at you and and see what comes up. Sounds good? Okay, cool. I got a thumbs up. Let's do it. Okay.

(01:27:23):
What is just one thing a founder or product leader can do to become better at sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:27:28):
The number one thing they can do, and this is very tactical, at the end of each meeting, because again, both of them are good middlers, the head of product and the founders are good demos, they're good at talking shop, they're good at talking in the industry, they're good at talking workflows. Learn. This is the only school you have to learn. Even if you're not comfortable asking for money, learn to ask for what's the next step, Lenny. This is what all great salespeople have learned to do. Actually, mediocre salespeople are terrible at this. The best salespeople never leave a meeting without a next step. The next step does not have to be a check. Don't break the relationship, but what's the next meeting? The next meeting might be, "Lenny, is there someone else at your company that I could do a demo for?" People are lazy, they don't want to do multiple demos.

(01:28:06):
But in 2024, we all have to demo multiple stakeholders. In 2021, it was one stakeholder. Now, it's a four-stakeholder sale. If you don't know what to ask at the end of the call, ask, "Who else? Lenny, is there someone else? I know you're excited to buy our product, but who else? Is there someone else in the organization? Can I help you? Can I just do a demo?" A demo is not threatening. Whatever the next step is, "What's the next step we can get on our books?" And listen. The best salespeople march deals step by step by step by step. And then, they put in the time. They've done the demos, they've done the pilot if they need to, they've helped them get going, they've helped them see the value. And then, if it takes six steps to say, "Okay, Lenny, now, we've got five folks at the organization using it. They've seen, here's the deal. They love it. What can we do, Lenny, to get going? Can we get a contract signed so we can get going on February 1st?" It's just very natural.

(01:28:56):
And founders just end the Zoom. They end the zoom, and they wait. They wait in their inbox for the next step to come, but it doesn't, it rarely comes on its own. That's the number one tip is, make sure yourself and you log it in your CRM that you always have a next step after. You don't have to be great at sales. As long as you're moving the ball down the field, then, get it into the red zone, and then, figure out how to ask for the money. But you don't have to ask for the money until it's in the red zone.

Lenny (01:29:21):
Amazing. While we're on this topic, is there a book or a course or anything that you'd just recommend folks go to get better at sales? Just, is there some tactical, "Go read this thing, it'll help you?" Or is it just, it's hard, you're not going to figure it out reading a book?

Jason Lemkin (01:29:35):
I am a voracious reader. If I only wanted to plug myself, and I usually wouldn't, two things that we have, we have something called SaaStr.University. SaaStr dot University. It's free. There's a pretty good course on learning about sales. It's not perfect, but it's pretty good. It just organizes a lot of the stuff we're talking about and it's free. I think it's pretty helpful. We actually wrote a book called From Impossible To Inevitable that sold about 100,000 copies.

Lenny (01:29:59):
Oh, wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:29:59):
I did almost none of the work, although a lot of is my content. Aaron Ross did it. It's actually really good, and it interviews a lot of top sales leaders and goes through a lot of stuff we did. I don't usually hype it, but for 15 bucks, I think this ... And actually, I've never made one dollar. I've never even gotten a check for these 100,000 copies, but I do think it's actually ... The second edition's pretty good. I think, if you like what we're talking about, the SaaS University and the others. I just hyped my own course, which is free. I don't think I'm selling something if it's free. The book, I don't make a dollar on. I'd be very cautious, and this is tough, maybe this is something we can work on together. There's so many courses and so many people selling stuff the last two years. Just be cautious. Just be cautious.

(01:30:39):
The last thing I will say is, there is another community called Pavilion, and I do think it's great, Pavilion. It does have a lot of networking and stuff for sales and connecting sales with founders, and I am a super fan of what they're doing. That one's worth investing. But be careful about Bob and John's sales courses on the internet. There's too many.

Lenny (01:31:00):
Awesome. All right. We'll link to all those things in the show notes.

(01:31:03):
Next question, what is the ideal trial length for a free trial for sales team? Is it 14 days, a month, years? What do you recommend?

Jason Lemkin (01:31:11):
Tomas Tsangaris did a whole SaaStr presentation just on free trials and free trial legs. It was really good, but the one thing you didn't know, which I know just being an old timer is, one of the reasons we have 14-day trials on the internet is, in the old days, the Salesforce sales team, when they were SMB focused, wanted to close deals that month, so they forced Salesforce to move from 30 to 14 days. There was no evidence it was better for the customer. There was no evidence that it got usage going or people ... They just wanted to close deals the same month.

(01:31:41):
That's something to be cautious about, these metrics. And be cautious, since we're talking to product folks, be cautious that they're customer centric. Salesforce is very enterprise now, but in the old days, it pushed it to 14 days so the sales reps could close deals faster. What we learned from Slack and Zoom until recently was infinite trials work pretty good. So does Canva. Slack and Canva, and until recently, Zoom, were okay waiting four years to convert. And those are epic companies. Those are epic companies.

(01:32:12):
And these are one of the things that only founders can make these decisions. I wrote this post years ago saying, "Who's your VP of Free?" Because who's got a VP of Free? Do you know anybody that has a VP of Free? I got a VP of Growth, I got a VP of Product, but if you have this massive free base, who's your VP of Free? I know almost no one that has a VP of Free. And usually, it's some kind of collaboration between product and the CEO. They're the VP of Free, but even then, you need a VP of Free, and we don't have one. There's no perfect answers, but in a world where we're tightening nooses everywhere on trials, we're tightening nooses everywhere, be careful the advice you get, be careful the short-term advice.

(01:32:49):
For example, another related terrible piece of advice VCs give you is switch to annual contracts. This is terrible advice. Terrible advice, Lenny. Terrible advice from people who've never built products and aren't in the field. Going to annual contracts, on a spreadsheet, looks great. On a spreadsheet-

Jason Lemkin (01:33:00):
Going to annual contracts on a spreadsheet looks great. On a spreadsheet, it looks great. You know what's better? Letting customers pay what they want to pay. If it's you or me buying for ourselves, Lenny, we're still going to put it on a credit card, aren't we? If it's our own personal... And we want to pay monthly, usually, we don't know. We usually want to just try it monthly. Big companies want to pay annually because they have procurement departments. Why force people to go the way they don't want to go? So, just start, this is a product audience. Product needs to be the voice of the customer. It's not so much customer success as it used to be. It's not so much sales. You've got to be the voice of the customer together with the founders and push these things.

(01:33:39):
Think about, I would do the longest possible trial that is still customer-centric and understand there's tension. Understand there's tension, right? I say anytime I'm in a board meeting where some VC says, "Let's do annual for an SMB." I mean, I'm like, "No. Show me the money. Show me the evidence that this is better for the customer." Right? How many times have you gone to buy something for yourself and it's 19 bucks a month? And that's annoying because it's an [inaudible 01:34:05] credit card charge. But do you want to pay 240 up front? I mean, maybe you do it for a Riverside or something you use all the time, but some random product you just discovered, you're just going to bounce.

Lenny (01:34:14):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:34:14):
So, who's going to show the data in the bounce, right? A related point for like in sales. No one does enough. Everyone does these win-loss meetings, but no one talks enough about the deals they lost. Everyone talks about the deals they won. All the lore, the tribal lore in sales is how we won the deal. People should be spending more time talking about deals they lost than the deals they won, right? And same thing for this PLG motion. If you make your... Yes, I give everyone a pass for 2023, everyone whose growth plummeted and did things they shouldn't. Did price increases they didn't earn, cut the free trials, hid their free editions. I'm going to give you, look, you've got to give your team a little stress relief, right? So, I'm giving every person I work with, every portfolio, everyone a one-year pass, but the past is in the past. We got to get back to being customer-centric and building businesses that build to 1 billion ARR on their own because they're wonderful businesses that are product-centric, right? That recur. And every time you rip a customer off, you lose, the relationship's damaged, isn't it?

(01:35:21):
And a controversial thing I say to the product team, but I think this is the right thing if you're going long, is look, everyone raised prices last year, as you know, right? Everyone raised prices. The question I ask folks is, "Did you earn it?" What feature did you [inaudible 01:35:36]? If you raised prices 8% last year, did you add 30% more value to your product? In the old days pre these crazy years, the answer usually was yes. People would wait up, they would wait a couple years, right? And the whatever product from four years ago was so much better. It really was. Really had earned 1995 instead of... Last year, no one earned their price increases. No one came out with an amazing new edition, an amazing new functionality that earned it. They just sent you an email saying, "You're paying more." So we get one pass, but earn it. Earn your price increase.

(01:36:12):
Have the longest free trial possible. Own it. And this VP of free thing, it's got to be founders working with product because no one else cares about the free. You can't expect the sales team to care about free, can you? You can't expect the marketing team to care about free. Unless they can immediately monetize them, right? Unless they can ram them into conversion. People abuse their long tail in the last 18 months, but your long tail is... These are your... Even if they don't convert that much, they're your advocates. I mean, how many people read your newsletter? 500,000 people, right?

Lenny (01:36:42):
Almost 600,000.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:42):
Okay. 600,000. Now, not all of them convert, do they?

Lenny (01:36:46):
No, no. That's exactly how I look at it. It's kind of this Brian Belfort is this... Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:49):
What about the 590,000 of them that love Lenny that don't convert, right?

Lenny (01:36:49):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:36:53):
If you over monetize them, then Lenny's community doesn't exist if you over monetize them. But when you bring in a VP of sales for Lenny and a VP of growth and... You can't expect them to care as much about that long tail as you, right?

Lenny (01:37:10):
I love your passion around this. So, what I'm hearing partly is you're a big fan of freemium, essentially, right? And the benefits of product-led growth where there's something you could just use indefinitely, or do you still think that's a trial where it needs to end at some point? Or is it just like, "No, freemium is great in a lot of cases."

Jason Lemkin (01:37:26):
Listen, I'm a big fan of long tails when they work. They don't always work for enterprise products. I'm a big fan of delivering more value than you take out for your customers. And I am a big fan overall of free, because, and I know you'll agree with me this, every founder figures this out at some point, free products are better software. Products that cannot offer a free edition cut corners because they don't have to be good at onboarding. The products that do not have a free edition have human beings that bridge the gap between buying and deployment. And that's okay at ServiceNow, and that's okay in certain products, but the best products invest the engineering cycles to have a free edition. Whether that's truly free, whether it's an extended free trial, whether it's a long tail or a medium tail, the amount of... All of your product is better if people can actually, if you have a free edition, all your customers benefit, even your enterprise customers benefit, they all benefit.

Lenny (01:38:28):
This idea of VP of free, I think technically it's probably the head of growth for a PLG company or the person leading the self-serve part of the business.

Jason Lemkin (01:38:36):
But even in the organizations I work with that have those structures, that person is focused on monetizing that tail. Who stands up for the 590,000 other readers of Lenny? Who's their champion?

Lenny (01:38:50):
Yeah, and you're 100% right. That's exactly how I think about the newsletter. There's this free audience and ideas over time, they get convinced, "This is worth my money and let's give it a shot."

Jason Lemkin (01:38:58):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:38:59):
So, yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:39:00):
And your growth person, let's say 1% converts. I'm just making that up. Going from 1 to 1.1 actually is a big deal at that scale or 1.2, right? That's okay. But you've got to nurture the 490,000, not spend all the calories just ramming the paid edition through, right? But only it's a fun thing, because once you hit a little bit of scale, this is part of your job as founders and product leaders is who's going to be this VP of free? It's not growth. I don't think it's the growth team or something. They got to hit their goal when their goal is to get another half million out of the newsletter this year. And that's their bonuses side to it. You think they're going to work on the free ones? No chance.

Lenny (01:39:43):
Makes sense. Oh man, there's so many things I can go into and want to go into. I also want to let you go. So with that, is there anything else, Jason, that you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Anything you want to leave listeners with?

Jason Lemkin (01:39:59):
I think just make this the year of the customer guys. And I really think that sales has been under so much pressure the last 18 months. Customer success has changed. Product teams have to step up. This is your time to do great things this year as product people. Be the voice of the customer. Be the VP of free, be the whatever. Be the champion. Stick your neck out. Work harder, folks. Work harder. The funnest part of anything in startups is working hard, but in product it's extra fun. By working harder, you have the more fun conversations. Find the delight in... The delight in product is making customers happy. It's not worth it otherwise. Otherwise, it's drudgery and it's endless PRDs and Gantt charts and mindless discussions. Make your customers happier this year, you will be happy. This is the year of product and we all get a pass for whatever bad deeds we did or mediocre deeds we did in 2023, get back and be the vanguard in your companies.

(01:40:53):
Startups need, and bigger companies, they need someone to inject energy again, in many cases. Energy has been lost. And it would be great if product can do it and say, "Listen, let's do something, even if we're not exactly sure how to get more leads, okay? Even if we're not exactly sure what to do, there's one thing under our control is the code we write and the product we ship. Let's do three great things this year. Let's just do them not good, great. Let's do three great." And what you'll find is the whole company will respond, including sales, including marketing, including... If we start shipping great thing. Few things inspire teams more than when you're shipping great products. So, be... If you weren't the leaders the last two years, if you were being forced to weaponize your customer base somehow ship three great things this year. That's my challenge. Ship three great things.

Lenny (01:41:39):
I love this. This is the year of product, that might be the title of this podcast.

Jason Lemkin (01:41:42):
Yes.

Lenny (01:41:44):
Jason, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jason Lemkin (01:41:50):
Okay. I'm worried about the first one, but go for it.

Lenny (01:41:52):
They're very non-surprising, because they're always the same. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:00):
That's the one I just want to take a pass on. I know they're the same. I read more than anybody else in the planet, but I wish I had those two great, great books that have changed my mind in the last 12 months, but hopefully I've added some value. But this one, I think I got to take a mulligan on it [inaudible 01:42:14] perfect answer.

Lenny (01:42:15):
Acceptable answer. Is there a favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoy?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:20):
Oh, the Terminal List.

Lenny (01:42:22):
The Terminal List?

Jason Lemkin (01:42:24):
The Terminal List, yeah. I'm not into the Chris Pratt. I'm not into that goofy superhero movies he does, and I know people like it, but The Terminal List, it's pretty, it's I got it, it's written by this ex Navy SEAL that I think tech people don't read the... Everyone, but outside of tech reads this author, but Amazon did this thing with The Terminal List and I think the reason it gripped me, it's like this post, it's like a lot of tech is right now is we're trying to do the right things, but are we doing the right things? It's just confusing. So this one, I couldn't put down, The Terminal List. That was my favorite show. The other one, the one I liked that I couldn't believe. You want the second one? Even though as product people, Maverick, and I'll tell you why. This movie Maverick, okay, you wouldn't think I'd be a Maverick guy, but the quality of this product, it was so high.

(01:43:18):
And what's interesting, you remember Maverick was supposed to come out before COVID, right? And Tom Cruise said no. He's like, "This is such a good product, we're going to wait years for this thing to come out." I'm like, " I'm not going to like this. I mean, cocktail was pretty good, but I'm not going to..." But as a product, when... I've watched this movie three times from a product perspective and just like software, when something is done that well, no wasted calories, no... You see everything tied together. That's the kind of software we love, right? It just delights us when it works better than we expected. So, those are my two.

Lenny (01:43:53):
You also did all his own stunts, which I think is a good metaphor for the VP of product, maybe being involved in sales?

Jason Lemkin (01:43:57):
Actually do the work.

Lenny (01:43:59):
Yeah, exactly. Oh man, I'm stretching it. Okay, next question. You answered a few of these already, but do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing salespeople, especially?

Jason Lemkin (01:44:09):
I answered it, but I'll bring it up again in case you do it again, is, "What do you want to do your first 14 days to head of product or head of sales? What do you want to do your first 14 days?" It's not a technical 30-day plan, you don't have to do 28 slides. It's what I call a Colombo question. Not that I really watch Colombo, but Colombo is this old detective on TV who, I don't know if you ever, he would ask these dumb questions, right? And then the murderer would thought Colombo was so dumb, but by the end of the episode he'd always incriminate himself because the question. So, when I interview, I always do Colombo questions. They're never tough ones, right? They're always nice. I don't know if I'm nice, I'm honest, but the interview [inaudible 01:44:42]. But Lenny, what would you do your first 14 days as VP of product here? And they don't want to visit customers. Don't hire them for either all sales or product. Just don't hire them.

Lenny (01:44:51):
I've got the answer now. That's exactly what I was going to say. Next question, what is a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?

Jason Lemkin (01:45:00):
My two aren't really amazing, but I'll answer them. I love this Opus Clip app for making clips from video. I know you have a whole team, so you probably don't need it, but I produce a lot. I mean, a lot of us do content marketing, right? Whoever does it. I produce a lot of content. I don't have enough time to do this. So, the only AI tool that I've found helpful so far is Opus Clip, which takes all of the incredible amount of YouTube content we have, force ranks it and turns it into 59 second clips. And I'm a case study on the website, I tried the earlier products. They were almost there, right? But it's not, is it as good as a clip team? Right? Is it? No.

(01:45:41):
But literally in 60 seconds, what's interesting is it can do something, I don't have time to, I could never make YouTube clips. I could never make Instagram shorts. I could never make... It just would never happen, right? It would never happen. And the fact that one product enables you to do something at a minimum viable quality you couldn't do before, I'm a super fan. It's pretty interesting. So, that's my favorite. And my other one is this one. This is the folding phone that's finally as good as a normal phone. See, there's The Terminal List that I've got folded up and it just works.

Lenny (01:46:11):
That's wild. [inaudible 01:46:12].

Jason Lemkin (01:46:12):
Weighs the same as an iPhone.

Lenny (01:46:13):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:13):
And so the reason it's cool is this has changed the way I do productivity. One Plus, it's the One Plus. One Plus, yeah, it's the first one that's the same form factor, same weight, same... So there's really no, there's no loss, right? And I can use my normal phone here like I'm using, it's a little funky, but it's the same... And then to be able to do content, to be able to check, to be able to do full email, full account, full everything like an iPad.

Lenny (01:46:39):
We see your Tesla where it's going, that gets parked. That's very cool. So, it's basically like an iPad plus a phone in one.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:47):
Yeah, I probably use this 50% of the time of the iPad.

Lenny (01:46:50):
Wow.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:50):
So, that's it. That is it. The other ones that-

Lenny (01:46:52):
And that's an Android?

Jason Lemkin (01:46:53):
... Make sense to me. Yeah, it's a Android, yeah.

Lenny (01:46:55):
Amazing. I had not seen that. That is extremely cool.

Jason Lemkin (01:46:55):
Very cool.

Lenny (01:46:58):
Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?

Jason Lemkin (01:47:07):
It's, "Be kind." When I reflect on my career, right? Mistakes, I don't think I'm mean. I actually think I care more than most people on the planet. I like to think I've helped a lot of people, but it's not taking the time to be kind at times and not taking time to be kind when things don't work out. Not taking time to be kind when you leave a situation. Not taking time to be kind when maybe someone's done the wrong thing, right? Not taking time to be kind to a customer that leaves, right? I remember in the early days of Adobe Sign of EchoSign, we had a top tech customer, and I killed myself to close this customer, right? Famous, huge, huge tech company today. And then our champion changed, right? Champion changed is the big issue in software and product and came in and brought in DocuSign instead of us.

(01:47:56):
And man, I was just so mad. I just tore into this guy. This guy had actually had dinner at my house, right? And he actually never, he just did it because it was good for his own career, right? And I was so mad, but I broke the relationship forever, right? That's just one random example. And I just think there's so much advice to fire fast and to be relentless and do all these things, right? But you've interviewed so many people, Lenny, right? I mean so many great leaders. I haven't done what you've done, but I've talked to almost all the top CEOs in SaaS, okay? And they're kind. It doesn't mean that they're soft, they're not soft, okay? They make tough decisions every day, but they're kind. And so in this world where everyone feels like they're getting ripped off or they're not paid enough, or I want founder pay for founder work, this motto, really it's troubling.

(01:48:51):
Everyone is founder pay for founder... "You want me to work more than 30 hours, Lenny? I need 30% of the company. I need founder pay for founder work." It's like, I hear you. But you'll find that by being totally committed, going to 110% and also finding a way to be kind, that will endure across your whole career. So, I know it's... Because I think I'm good, but not always kind. It's how I challenge myself all the time. Be kinder in that conversation. And the big epiphany, we already talked about it, it shouldn't have taken me this long to realize that anytime an employee fails, it's your fault, be kind. You hired them. They never knew what they were getting themselves into. If the job's too hard, if they lack the skills, if there's not enough budget, if there's not enough people, if it requires too many hours to work, you should have known that. Not them. Be kind. Be kind to every single person on your team that doesn't work out. That's not just putting together an email spreadsheet and sending it out. Try, try harder. Be there for them. Be kind.

Lenny (01:49:44):
Be kind. I love this. I know that you actually, your username on Twitter includes, "Be kind." In your actual-

Jason Lemkin (01:49:51):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
Yeah.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:52):
It's a reminder.

Lenny (01:49:52):
So, you really back this up. Amazing. Okay, final question. You're on a giant conference, SaaStr.

Jason Lemkin (01:49:58):
Yes.

Lenny (01:49:59):
First of all, just talk about what it is so people know and explore it and check it out. But the actual question is what would surprise people most about running a conference like this? Things that they know, think about it goes into running a conference like this.

Jason Lemkin (01:50:13):
Any business, no matter how weird it is, that's at scale, the best one in it, it's always interesting, I think for case studies, right? The best, pick anything, the best cup maker, whoever it is, whoever makes the best... This is not an interesting business, the Starbucks cup on its own, but the best person, I pretty much guarantee you there's a good story there, right? SaaStr is a community as well like you have. We started this really early in 2011, 2012 for B2B founders back when that seemed like a weird thing to do. Now it doesn't seem so weird. So, we built a lot of content and we started doing events and meetups. I never did a meetup. You do a lot of meetups, but when I did meetups, I'd never actually even been to one. So, I did meetups in 2012 and 2013, but 1,000 people came to the meetups.

(01:50:56):
That will make sense to you today, but a decade ago for B2B, it was pretty, people were like, "Why are all these people here? We thought there was six of us that cared about B2B." So, then we did a big event. We did a one-day SaaStr annual in 2015, and 3000 people came including the evening. And so we just kept going. So, we get about 10 to 12,000 people together a year. What that means is change. It's no longer novel. I'm not the only person producing B2B content anymore. I'm not the only founder that sold their company like in the old days. There's plenty much more successful founders and better, I certainly, I don't do very many podcasts, because I'm not a hundredth as good as you. I do one a quarter, for example.

(01:51:34):
But the events have become this meeting place for founders that have hit scale, that are somewhere between 1 million and 20 million. And especially folks that aren't in Silicon Valley, especially folks that aren't sitting in Hayes Valley or wherever, that don't have a community. And that surprised me in the beginning how many international folks would fly all the way to the Bay Area. I remember this founder came from Perth, Australia for the first afternoon. I'm like, "Thanks for coming, but this is a lot of work." He is like, "I didn't come for you. I came because there's no one like me in Perth." So, it's taken on a life of its own. There's a lot of learnings. I think, I didn't intend to do mass scale events. I intended to just do meetups, because I had a community like you do meetups. So, it was absolutely an accident. The learnings are, it's extremely expensive and it has this weird curve. Okay, that's this weird curve where, and this is more because I think actually all founders, all startups should be doing events for their own customers, at least steak dinners I've written about. You should get your customers, if you get your customers and prospects together, you sell more. Get your customers and... It does not need to be a million dollar or 10 million event. It can be Roots Chrises, it can be whatever. It does not even need to be fancy. Just get them together.

Lenny (01:52:39):
It has to be steak though.

Jason Lemkin (01:52:41):
Yeah, well, no, but steak does work. I mean, I'm not a big steak guy. It could be any, just something nice where they want to go. It, just where they want to go. Your customers will sell your prospects for you. Your customers will do the selling for you [inaudible 01:52:53] bring them together.

(01:52:55):
When you do it really small, it's cheap, because how much does that back room cost at the steakhouse, right? It's worth it if you get one big deal out of it, right? And then you graduate and then you'll do a meetup and you'll do it at someone's office. Some tech company, they'll give it to you for free, they have an extra office. That costs nothing, right? And then you're like, "Well, that went well. We got 100, 200 people came to Lenny's thing at Digital Ocean." And then you say, "I'm gonna do an event." And then you rent a theater, a disuse. And these theaters are actually kind of cheap because they're dark during the day. There's not a lot going on and a lot of... Not movie theaters but music. So, those are cheap. But then you're like, "Well, there's only one stage and it smells like beer."

(01:53:34):
So, then the next year you do a hotel and a hotel's pretty expensive. It's like half a million, 800,000 and I hated hotels. But you know what I learned from the business model? It's turnkey landing. So, your marketing manager can call up the Hilton in any city and in two weeks spool up some mediocre AV, some mediocre chicken wings and drinks, okay? And you and I don't like to go to the Hilton that much. The ballroom C, we don't like to go to events [inaudible 01:54:00], but it turns out your customers don't care. They want to be together and talk about your app, right? And then if you do community like you do, you could probably charge a couple $100 for tickets and get some sponsors and bring in some revenue, right? But then after Hilton Ballroom B, it costs $2 million to turn the lights on.

(01:54:16):
And SaaStr annual... So, our Europa event in London's in early June, June fourth to fifth, please come if you want. That costs $2 million to turn the lights on in London. To turn the lights on in the Bay Area for 12,000 people in September in the Bay Area, which is the most expensive place, right? It's $10 million to turn the lights on.

Lenny (01:54:32):
Holy shit.

Jason Lemkin (01:54:34):
It's $10 million to turn the lights on. Now, I'm being a little expansive in what I mean by turn the lights on, but this is what it's going to cost you. It's going to cost you about $1000 per attendee in the Bay Area or Las Vegas to have a mass scale event. Not smaller, not one day in Grand Ballroom B, but a multi-day event, right? The AV is 1.5 million. The food and beverage is 1.5 million. The tenting is $800,000. I can keep going. So, once you get to 20, 30, 40 million in revenue, quietly, there's public companies out there.

(01:55:04):
They have software like Margins at that scale, but before that, it's brutal, right? And when I started doing these events, I interviewed the head of it back before March 2020 when tech companies did their own events, they've pretty much given up, which is an interesting side topic. Big ones like big, not small ones, but big ones. Biden View, the head of events at everyone, right? At Twilio and Marketo and dah, dah. They all be like, "Well, how'd the event go?" It'd all be the same. Well, we brought in about 1.5 million revenue. " Oh, okay." "And we lost 2 million." Everyone lost 2 million. Every single one lost 2 million. And you could see in the financial state, even Zoom at that scale just announced how much money they lose at Zoomtopia. So, it's a terrible business. What I like to say is it has diseconomies of scale. The Lenny's little free meetup costs zero, right? And then the one at Cloudflare's office costs zero.

(01:55:50):
And the one at Hilton B maybe costs $200, but then it costs $1000 per person at scale, right? Even more like Moscone like in San Francisco is probably the most expensive. You're approaching $2,000 per person, because you have to buy about 15 to 20 million of hotel nights to do an event in Moscone, right? So I don't know if that's... We could, I mean it's a side topic, Lenny's side podcast for people that care. But this diseconomies of scale. But there are a handful of public companies that do Lions, Money 2020, Shoptalk, a few others that are at SaaStr scale. And they cobbled together these very profitable public companies. But they all got to do at least 20 to 30 million, because you've got to get over a 10. And it's intimidating to get over a $10 million net, right?

(01:56:33):
And so what it means is we have to spend 14 to 16 months each year planning for SaaStr annual because it's not that fun if you fall six or $8 million behind. That's what happened in March 2020. We were the first major event to be canceled by COVID in March 2020. The first one, RSA happened for security the week before then we got canceled. So, we lost $10 million in one day and it took a long time to dig out of that hole, Lenny, especially since we monetize nothing, it took a long time, but they're worth it.

(01:57:04):
I know you don't do traditional events, but you do do meetups in your community, and I know they're worth it. I know they're worth it. Bringing your customers together, bringing your community together, and we talked about this offline before we started. Second tier, third tier events I do not think are worth it because they do not attract the best people. It's just a fact. Most people, it turns out from our founders are our core ICP. They go to two events a year on average, two events a year, okay? And they'll do other steak dinners. So, if you go to one of the two that they're at, you just might bump into Jeff Lawson or Eric Juan or whoever the next one. They might be there. That might be one of their two, but they don't go to number three through 10. They don't go to these. So, my role in general is people wonder, should I go to events? Is it worth my time? It's a waste of time.

(01:57:49):
And I know you've thought about it. And the irony is, even though we produce events, I used to think that. I didn't want to do events, I just wanted to do meetups, right? I was shy, I just wanted to do meetups. But then I learned over time that the best events bring the best vendors, the best executives, the best everything together. So, pick the one or two best events in your industry. And even if you're antisocial, try to go to one or two a year, go along. It pays off. It pays off, but maybe don't bother with the rest, even if they're ski slopes or they're fun that the subscale, subscale just doesn't work for meeting and marketing to people. It just doesn't work.

Lenny (01:58:25):
I said at the top of this podcast that there's a billion things that we could talk about, and I think that's exactly what happened. We can go in so many directions. And that alone was extremely interesting, because people want me to run a conference and I really don't. And I really enjoy the meetups that we have now. And we actually do have sponsors that cover drinks and food and things like that, and they're very chill, and I really love what happens at those things. But yes, this is really good information. Jason, I have two more questions for you that I ask everyone. I think we went through a couple of these things, but just real quick, where can folks find you if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jason Lemkin (01:59:03):
In general just go to this kooky, URL, SaaStr, saastr.com. That's a way to access a lot of what we're talking about. If they want to reach me to be transparent, I get a lot of impound, like I'm sure you do, to be honest, guys, it is hard to process the amount of inbound that folks get, right? But I'll give you an insider tip. I do see almost all of it. So, if you want to reach me, if you just want an hour of my time randomly, I'm sorry, honestly, I'm sorry, I don't have that hour of time, okay? But if you want to interact lightly, I mean, I'm on Twitter all most days @Jasonlk. I'm on LinkedIn a lot, just search for me, Jason Lemkin. LinkedIn's pretty cool. I have 260,000 followers. We have really good conversations. And I will tell you, if you have a question like you really need some help in your business or you want to do a pitch, if you send me the world's best email pitch, I will read a 100% of them.

(02:00:00):
Track it, put it in Mixmax, put it in HubSpot, put it... You'll see I'll open that email if the title's good. It doesn't mean I can respond. I'm sorry, no, Lenny can't respond, but realize it is going to be read. If you need a favor, like a help, if you ask the question super discreetly like, "Jason, here's the LinkedIn, I'm Lenny. I'm trying to hire this person. I'm at four millionaire doubling. Should I hire her?" There's a chance I'll look at that LinkedIn, I can tell you, or if it's one question, but if it's an hour or coffee, it isn't going to work, but it is going to get read. So, do that by email. Do it even by LinkedIn. I didn't used to read those LinkedIn emails, but if it's really good, I will read it and I probably respond to five or six of them a day.

(02:00:35):
I give to the extent that it's helpful, free answers, free advice. Not that I charge for anything, but make it good. Don't ask for coffee. So, many folks have written this, the most important people in the world read email. It's an open medium, right? And a subset of those folks actually read their social media. Even Elon Musk reads his, before he bought Twitter, he read it. You can access almost anyone in this industry. Just be super strategic about how you do it. Again, put yourself in your shoes. Would you answer this? Would you do this? But I would say half the stuff gets open to read. So, I know that's a rambly answer, but first, we talked about sales. You can reach anybody in the world via email. It's magical.

Lenny (02:01:11):
I'm sorry for the many emails you might get from this podcast. That is actually really good advice. Resonates deeply with me as well. Jason, thank you so much for being here.

Jason Lemkin (02:01:21):
Thank you for all the time, Lenny. I'm a super fan. It's great to be here and let me know anything I can do to support you or your community going forward.

Lenny (02:01:28):

# What world-class GTM looks like in 2026 | Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (Vercel, Stripe, Google)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I've been getting so many asks for go-to-market help.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:03):
With AI, it's just intensified because you have 10 players pursuing the same market opportunity and so your ability to actually bring the product to market to differentiate yourself from the competition has become more strategically important than it was previously.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):
I had Jenna Abel on the podcast recently, one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:27):
80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to increased upside, which is a good thing for startup founders to understand. We all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. For everybody else, particularly enterprises. You're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
I've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:00:55):
We buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. The experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the merchant. And so then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:17):
Something I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:01:23):
The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:38):
Today my guest is Jeanne Grosser. Jeanne was chief product officer at Stripe where she built their very early sales team from the ground up. She's currently COO at Versel where she oversees marketing, sales, customer success, revenue ops and field engineering. Jeanne has built world-class go-to-market teams at multiple unicorns and has advised dozens of companies on doing the same. In our conversation, we go deep on what a world-class go-to-market team looks like, including what the heck is go-to-market, the rise of the go-to-market engineer and how this role is already enabling her team to operate 10 times faster. A bunch of very specific tactics to level up your go-to-market skills, a primer on segmentation, how to think about your go-to-market process like a product, her favorite go-to-market tools, her hot takes on PLG and sales comp and sales hiring, and so much more. If you are looking to get smart on the latest and greatest in go-to-market thinking, this episode is for you.

(00:02:34):

Head on over to Lenny's newsletter.com and click product pass. With that, I bring you Jeanne Grosser after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:03:14):
This episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Epo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX, friction and business impact.

(00:03:32):
It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention, and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus experiments, prove what works. I saw this first hand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong and the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Epo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with Heatmaps and Scrollmaps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags, that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics.

Jean, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:32):
Thanks for having me. Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:34):
What I wanted to get out of this conversation by the end of this to basically have this conversation be the thing that we send people when they're like, "I want to get better go to market. I'm trying to figure out what to do and get to market." We send them this versus having to hire someone for a lot of money and usually they can't find amazing people, because they're all snatched up. So let me start with just the basics. When people hear at the term go to market, what does that mean? What does that encompass?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:05:57):
I think there are two answers to this. Often what people think of is sort of the tip of the spear of what drives revenue, which is marketing and sales. For me, I think of it as any function that is going to touch a customer or make a dollar, and actually my remit at Vercel is that, so that includes marketing, sales, all of your technical sales roles like sales engineers or post-sales platform architects is what we call them at Vercel. It's customer success, it's support, it's partnerships. And the reason I say that is my experience throughout my career has been that those functions often have this Venn diagram strategy where marketing's pursuing one thing, it overlaps with what sales is pursuing, but not perfectly, which also overlaps with what support is pursuing but not perfectly. Examples of this would be slightly differing segmentation frameworks, et cetera.

(00:06:57):
And so one of the things I think you're going to want to see more in this particular moment is that that become a really integrated lifecycle. In particular, I think we're going to see a lot of the functions of go-to-market get redefined, so we've gone through a period of hyper-specialization in go-to-market depending on how you count them. There are, I think somebody quoted 17 different roles within go-to-market these days and I hypothesize that a lot of those are going to start to collapse. And so if you think of go-to-market more holistically, I think you can kind of go back to what are the jobs to be done from making a customer prospect aware of your product all the way through to high LTV, five years on the platform, fully wall-to-wall, and you're going to want to map that out and orchestrate it the way you would think about that within your own product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:54):
Awesome. We're going to go through that whole cycle of go-to-market, but so is it safe to say just for most companies that are especially starting out when they say go-to-market, that mostly is sales and then there's marketing as maybe a smaller fraction of that and then as you become more advanced and grow, customer success plays into it, tech sales, things like that?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:12):
Yeah, that's probably where most start is getting sales or frankly just because a lot of companies also start PLG, you might actually start with marketing and then you're layering in sales when it's time to do the sales assistant and ultimately sales led portions. So I think it can, depending on your product and your initial target market, it can either mean marketing or sales or a combination of those two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):
Awesome. So essentially it's like the term go-to-market tells you what we're talking about. How do you take your product to market, get people aware of it, using it, sticking with it?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:42):
Yep, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:44):
What has most changed in the world of go-to-market over the last few years? You've done this for a long time at Google, at Stripe, you built it for sales team, now you're doing that at Vercel. What's changed most in the skill and art of go-to-market?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:08:55):
There are a number of things. So when consumption-based business models started, I think you saw go-to-market shift into being meaningfully more consultative because often that first land was the very beginning of the journey and represented a very small percent of what you were ultimately going to do with that customer. And so you had to go from being transactional to a lot more. You had to more deeply understand what that customer was trying to do so you could align that ultimately to your product. I think that has played out that much more with an AI because right now everyone knows they need to change, but they don't necessarily know exactly what they need to change to, whether that's their customer-facing product or their internal productivity and workflows. And so I think you're seeing a lot more of go-to-market orgs leaning into the art of the possible best practices, helping you actually think things through as if they were a consultant.

(00:09:52):
And so one of the things you see more of right now is forward-deployed engineering, which on some level is kind of a rebrand of professional services but kind of not. And a big part of that is, hey, how do I actually get into your environment, ride alongside you better understand what you're trying to do and then help you actually bring the technology to life and learn a lot along the way.

(00:10:18):
Often you're not only making that customer successful, but you're then taking all of that back to your product and engineering organization to figure out, okay, what was generalizable that we ought to build into our offering versus what is something that ultimately is going to be more of a professional service in the fullness of time. So I think that has been a biggie, is actually just really getting embedded with your customer. And then unsurprisingly, I think bringing AI to bear on the sales process is another big one. And so you've seen the rise in probably the last 18 to 24 months of the go-to-market engineer, which different folks define slightly differently, but it's kind of bringing one technical prowess to bear on go-to-market in general so you can have a lot better tooling, data use, et cetera. And then two, increasingly bringing AI to bear as well to re-architect your workflows and also make it so that it's easier to have a personalized experience with customers but do so at scale.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):
Amazing. Okay, let's follow the thread on this go-to-market engineer, so what was it like before and what are these engineers doing at companies?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:11:33):
So I think maybe an interesting story to tell. When I was at Stripe, we went to launch an outbound SDR function. So outbound prospecting and Stripe always ran lean. The company at that time had an operating principle which was efficiency is leverage. And so if you looked at the sales organization I was running, most companies out there probably would've had 30 SDRs and I was going to get four. So there's no way I was going to do the typical SDR approach and be successful. And so we thought to ourselves, okay, what can we do? We'll be super data-driven. And so we went and we started building project Rosland. Rosland is the scientist who originally mapped A-DNA. And what this was was effectively a company universe. So you can think of this as a massive database. Every row was a different company on the planet and every column was an attribute about that company that would help you sell to them in a more targeted fashion.

(00:12:39):
So at Stripe an example would be knowing that their business model was a marketplace was super helpful, because that would mean you wanted to sell Stripe Connect versus vanilla payments. And so the goal was basically, hey, can we create a mad Libs where I will come up with sort of a predefined email template, but 80% of it will be fill in the blank based on the different attributes of that customer. So if they're this industry or this business model, then pull this customer, reference this value prop, send it to this persona, not that. And we were trying to do this in 2017 and it was very hard and didn't actually totally work our ability to the false positive rate and we worked deeply with DSI and it just never really got there. And now that we're literally redoing here at Vercel as we speak and it actually works and you can bring AI to bear on it.

(00:13:41):
And so what's different is we now, I have a data scientist just like I did back in 2017, but I have a go-to-market engineer whereas before I just had someone in systems that was helping me configure outreach or sales off and my go-to-market engineer is helping me build an agent where we're coming up with, okay, well what's the human workflow that you would've done? And then how do you encode that using Vercel workflows as an example in actual code that's both deterministic and less so where an agent's going out and trying to replicate what a human might've done to produce that, fill in the blank, matlit.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:21):
I love the ambition of that project. What is this, like eight years ago?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:25):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):
I love the big thinking there. We're going to map the entire universe of companies and then here's how we sell to them. And then just I'm trying to picture doing that without AI. It's like crazy to imagine trying that without AI and that's so much simpler to even imagine.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:14:38):
Well the thing that's amazing about that, just to geek out on a second, so I was working on that with a bunch of folks at Stripe on my team, obviously at a gentleman named Ben Salzman who went on to go to ZoomInfo and then actually recently just founded a go-to-market startup that is basically sort of productizing that concept of a company universe and then layering AI on it on top of it. And ultimately his view is actually AI will get to the point that you won't have to do outbound prospecting because it will just sort of company and product match. So it's fun to sort of see back in 2017 some of the folks doing that now work at OpenAI, they work at Anthropic, they also are doing GTM Eng. You've got him starting a totally AI native GTM company and then here I'm at Vercel trying to do the same.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):
Okay, so what's cool is this is an emerging role, an emerging skill that I don't think a lot of people have recognized as something that is happening. So one example I'm hearing of what this role does is they automate outbound emails essentially and outbound outreach. They figure out, they write workflows and agents that figure out here's the company to go after, here's how we message them. Does that end up being kind of like an email that's custom designed and written for this prospect?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:15:54):
That's one version. So it's broader than that really. Basically the full remit of GTM Eng will be to go through each of the different functions within go to market and break down all the different workflows that they do and then turn those into agents where AI is better placed than the human to do that task. So right now we started with actually inbound and are now moving to outbound because that workflow is most legible. And by legible I mean you can basically write it down. It's relatively replicable, mostly deterministic. So it's more likely that AI will do it well and we actually built the agent and then we keep a human in the loop. But from there we're starting to look at outbound and with an outbound we're starting more at the lower end of the market, where you tend to have slightly less customization because there's a single decision maker at the company.

(00:16:56):
But I think it'll take a while before we're able to really do that in a very large enterprise. There we might use an agent for research but maybe not all the way to actually send a message and that's just within the prospecting function. So other places that we're looking at this would be for install-based sales. So again there it's a little bit more deterministic because you've got awesome internal data on what a customer is and isn't using, what's the next best action? What's the thing they should get most value from? So that's where we're starting to map, hey, what does that ideal workflow look like? But basically you want to get to a state where as long as I've been in sales, they release these annual reports that help us all benchmark ourselves relative to one another. And one of the stats is what percent of time do your sellers actually spend in front of customers?

(00:17:44):
And for the 20 years I've been in sales, it's always been somewhere around 30% to 40%. So the minority of time is actually talking to other humans and I think we're getting to a point where with layering in agents, ideally we finally get salespeople to a point where they're actually spending 70% of their time interacting with humans and we can get the research, the follow-up, the things that are a little bit more rote and don't use the entirety of your human capacity done by an agent and then sort of unleash you to go deeper with your customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:17):
I love that this is such a great example of where AI is contributing in a very meaningful high ROI way, taking on all this work that people... like, you have to hire say 50 SDRs as you described to do and now you could do with a lot more. So it's a really cool example of leverage that AI gives you. One thing that I know a lot of people think about when they hear this is, okay, I'm going to get more of these really bad emails trying to pitch me on stuff and just like this isn't going to work. I can tell this is AI. What have you learned about how to do this where people actually receive emails that actually convert and do well?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:18:51):
Our processes all always have human in the loop. And so basically where we'll start is we take a go to market engineer and we have them shadow the highest performing individual in that function. And so you can go and you shadow an SDR and you can see, oh wow, they've got seven tabs open. They're looking up the person on LinkedIn, they're reading about the company, they're doing chatGPT on this, they're looking in this database to get these sets of attributes. And so that's how you sort of inform the initial workflow. And then what we do is we let the agent make a call. So in the specific example with inbound, you have to determine whether or not you think the lead is likely to be qualified and then you have to determine what to say to it. And so we'll let the agent make those two calls.

(00:19:44):
It ultimately then does some deep research, pulls in a bunch of information from our databases and crafts a response, but we have a human review all of those and actually hit send. Now for us, we had 10 SDRs doing this inbound workflow and now we just have one that is effectively QA-ing the agent. The other nine we deployed on outbound, so we got to move them up the value chain. At some point I think we'll get to a place where we feel like, "Hey, the human reviewer is saying yes enough of the time that we feel confident that these will be on brand targeted, et cetera," but right now we're still trying to train the agent and it incorporates feedback on what we choose to reject, edit, et cetera.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:31):
And you shared that it's already having a lot of impact. Like you said, you had 10 SDRs and now one can do the job of 10.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:20:39):
So before we did that move, I mean the other thing that's just incredible about this is the person who built the lead agent was a single GTM engineer. He spent maybe 25-30% of his time on this. It was six weeks before we felt confident going from 10 to one. So it wasn't like this was a multi-quarter process, it actually moved super quickly and then again now we just sort of keep that agent manager working with the agent to get it to a point where we say, "Hey, we're ready to roll." Actually throughout the process we also tracked all of the KPIs that you typically would hold an SDR accountable to. We were looking at our lead to opportunity conversion rate, we're looking at the number of touches it takes the time to convert, and basically what we were able to do is hold that lead to opportunity conversion rate flat. So the agent is as good as our humans were, but it's actually condensed the number of touches it takes to convert because it's so much quicker at responding relative to leads inevitably sitting in the queue or coming in at nighttime and no one can get to it, that type of deal. So that's sort of when we knew it was ready to pull nine people off and shift them into outbound.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):
That's incredible. Okay, that's interesting. So you shift them to outbound. What I love about this is this SDR that is now doing this is, as you said, doing the things they enjoy more, they're talking to customers more, they're not doing all this kind of top of funnel rote work. I don't want to get into whole jobs AI discussion, but there's always been this talk about AI SDRs basically replacing SDRs. It feels like that's one thing where everyone's like this is a hundred percent going to be AI in the future. What I'm hearing here is it gives one Aster a lot more leverage and obviously you still need people running the show. Thoughts there? Just like do you think AI will replace all this at some point? And then I don't know, you don't need salespeople?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:22:32):
I think on prospecting it can replace a fair amount because the average SDR wasn't doing overly sophisticated research in the first place. So where I, think the last part to go as I mentioned will be in deep enterprise prospecting where you can be at multiple layers in an org chart, you've got to pick between business lines, you've got to triangulate those. But I do think for the things that are more repetitive that often don't take that much time to learn and get ramped, AI will be good at that. And in my view, no one graduated from college and was like, "Yes, I just went to college for four years to become an SDR." It was more, "Okay, that's where you are forced to start." But I think the average SDR could have gone straight into outbound or straight into an SMB closing role. And so basically what we're just doing is shifting folks into something that uses more of their full capacity right out of the gates rather than sort of the forcing function of working your way up the totem pole.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:48):
Awesome. Since a lot of people listening to this aren't salespeople don't have a lot of background in sales, we've used this term SDR, there's also the term AE. Can you just help people understand what is an SDR, what do they do, what's an AE, and then what's the role above?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:24:01):
Sure. So SDR is typically in charge of generating pipeline. They're meant to talk to prospective customers and get them to a point where it is worth investing time to run them through a sales process. You typically have two types of an SDR, have an inbound one. So this is where people come to your website, they fill out contact sales, they'll be the first call to make sure that it's actually worth a more expensive account executive to go and run a sales process or you then have outbound. So this is where when you want to grow faster than your inbound demand, they will go out and at this point you probably have a point of view on where you think you have product market fit. And so they will target that part of the market and try to drum up interest from folks who weren't otherwise raising their hand saying, I'd like to talk to you.

(00:24:54):
So that's sales development basically. Pipeline generation account executives are closers. So it's their job to take somebody from, "Okay, hey, I'm interested in learning about your solution, I have a legitimate problem. I potentially could make a decision," to, "I now believe that your product is the best in the market for me and I'm willing to pay for it." And then account executives, depending on the segments that your company sells into E.G. small business, mid-market enterprise, et cetera, they may work their way up the food chain from selling to a smaller company like an SMB or a startup. Those tend to be a little bit more of a transactional sale. You often have a single decision maker to then going into a mid-market or a commercial role where now maybe you have an economic buyer like somebody in finance and a technical buyer like somebody in engineering to getting into enterprise where you have procurement and you have committees and 10 people have to weigh in and you've got to help them figure out how to de-risk the fact that they're probably migrating from something so much more complicated coordination effort to sell.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:05):
That was extremely helpful. So SDR, pipeline generation, i.e., closer. Such a simple way of thinking about it. Okay, this is great. Going back to the GDM engineer, a few questions for people that may want to try this at their company, what scale do you think it makes sense to start hiring for this role? Having someone automate in the go-to-market process?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:26:25):
What's interesting about this is it will force companies to be more rigorous about their sales process early. So often startups when they go from founder led sales to say, I'm going to have my first sales person, whether that's an actual account executive who has sales experience or your general athlete, wicked smart, who's going to go figure it out. Often founders will just say, "Okay, sales is showing up and talking to people. Isn't that what I just did for the last couple of years?" But actually sales is more than that. It's a skill just like writing code as a skill or building a financial model as a skill, it's about discovery. So asking all the right questions that help you identify challenges in pain, willingness to pay, et cetera, and then going through a process to handle those objections and showcase where are you at enough value such that somebody ultimately wants to hand over some money.

(00:27:24):
So often startups will get, particularly ones with strong product market fit to pretty significant scale without really having a replicable process. And you can't really apply go to market engineering unless you actually have a point of view on what best practice should look like. And so I think basically this is going to force folks to have more of a playbook out of the gates, what's working, what's not? Can I document it? Do I have content for the different parts of the sales process? And then once you do that, which maybe 10 people is a good size and scale for that, ostensibly a GTM engineer can come in and turn that into an agent. You could also argue that if you're a founder who wants to bring in a general athlete profile and that person is technically minded, that you could have a hybrid AE GTM engineer who figures out what their best practice is and then tries to turn that into an agent that's riding alongside them and making them more effective as well.

(00:28:26):
So I don't know that I have a point of view yet on what's the optimal size and scale, but I forever have given founders the advice that you often want to bring in revenue operations, which is basically the analytical arm of sales earlier than you think because having data, having process is actually what gives you insights as a founder into what is and isn't working. And so I would argue just like it's a good idea to have that sooner than later, increasingly it'll probably be a good idea to have GTM engine and be looking to bring agents to bear on your process at the outset.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):
While we're on this topic, just a quick tangent, the advice for hiring your first salesperson that I usually hear is wait until you're around a million in ARR. When you have a repeatable process, you can teach someone anything there. Does that seem right? What would you recommend?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:29:18):
Yeah, I think that seems about right. I do think as a founder you want to stay deeply connected to customers and get it to a scale and get it to a point where you use the word, there's some repeatability there. I think that's one of the things that not all founders get right is founders are incredible salespeople. They convinced a VC angel investors to fork over a bunch of money, so clearly they're going to inspire people to buy. But if you're getting to a million in ARR and the set of customers you have look nothing like one another, you still have very much like an evangelist sale, very much founder led sale versus if you can say, "Hey, I now have an ICP here, or ideal customer profile, e.g something you can write down. We are good. Our product fits with startups with less than a hundred employees who are typically building SaaS applications," something like that.

(00:30:14):
Then you're probably ready to hand over the reins. And then what founders have to remember is to actually hand over the reins. So you've got to enable the person who comes in, what is it that you're doing effectively, what's your content, what are the discovery questions you are asking? How are you handling objections so you can transition that knowledge but also don't handle them over entirely. You want to stay connected to the customer because you still have a fair amount of R&D to do to figure out where is the product next going to resonate, where are you getting stock as you scale, etc.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):
To close the loop on the go-to-market engineer, what's the profile of the ideal go-to-market engineer, may be your first.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:30:57):
What we have found works really well is somebody who does have go-to-market experience. So at Vercel, our first three go-to-market engineers we're actually sales engineers. So Vercel hires very technical sales engineers, all of them were front end developers before they decided they wanted to get into sales. And so we just said, "Hey, three of you, congrats." You're now founding members of our GTM Eng team. And the thing that works well there is you do understand aspects of what is good GTM, what does a process look like? It's been really interesting actually. So the gentleman who runs GTM Eng for me, we were going through this lead agent and QA-ing it. And so I'm going and I'm looking at some of the responses that we've ultimately had the lead agent send and realized, "Oh, I wouldn't have sent that and that's because I have 20 years of sales experience and we modeled the lead agent off our best person, but our best person who has two years of sales experience." So it actually is important to understand the art and the science of sales and how you bring best practice to bear. Either you've done it and so you know some best practice or you're going to geek out on sales, read a bunch of books, learn a thing or two, and try to incorporate some of those into your agent development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:28):
That is really interesting. So come from the sales side, not from the engineering side. And I imagine this is such a cool opportunity for salespeople to do something completely different and move closer to engineering.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:32:38):
Yeah, I mean we're having a lot of fun with it. At Vercel in particular, we basically get to be customer zero. So everything that we're building with agents, we're building on Vercel's AI cloud. So these agents now have multiple steps that they go through. So we're using Vercel's workflow SDK and workflow offering. We use the AI gateway to call the different models that we use to do deep research or other enrichment that we do. So for us it's great because we basically sort of bang on everything the engineering team is building and get to go be a discerning customer before we actually get it out the door to real customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):
What a fun time to be alive. I could tell the fun that you guys are having, just from the way you describe it.

(00:33:29):
Stripe handles the massive scale and complexity of many of the world's fastest growing enterprises, including 78% of the Forbes AI 50 and more than half of the Fortune 100 enterprises like Atlassian, Figma and Urban Outfitters use Stripe to create fully branded and customized checkout pages with access to more than 125 global payment methods. There's a reason I've had more leaders from Stripe on this podcast than any other company. They know how to build great products that scale and that people love. And Stripe is a lot more than payments. They've also got a category leading billing solution and a highly optimized checkout experience built specifically to increase your checkout conversion. Join the ranks of industry leaders like Salesforce, OpenAI and Pepsi that are using Stripe to grow faster and to grow the world's GDP, learn how Stripe can help your business grow at Stripe.com. Zooming out a little bit in terms of you mentioned tools and tools that you use. I'm curious just what are kind of the state of the art tools within the go-to-market stack that you love that you'd recommend?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:34:33):
Well, so I'm going to have an interesting answer to this, so I'll give you one. And it's not state-of-the-art per se, although I don't mean that disparagingly, it's just that it's been around for a while now and a lot of folks use it, but I think Gong has gotten just meaningfully more interesting in the last year. And then second half of my question I will get into, I think the calculus on build versus buy is changing. So all right, Gong. Gong is incredible because you can run agents against it now. So we take all of our Gong transcripts and we dump them into an agent called the deal-bott, and that deal-bott then can do a bunch of things. So the first thing we had it do was lost opportunity review. So we had just finished Q2, we had a list of our top losses for the quarter sorted by deal size, and we ran it against that and it was incredibly interesting.

(00:35:39):
So the biggest loss that quarter according to the account executive was lost on price. And when you ran the agent over every Slack interaction, every email, every GONG call, it said actually you lost because you never really got in touch with an economic buyer. And when you talked to somebody about ROI and total cost of ownership, it was clear from their reaction that they didn't really buy your mass. And so really the reason we lost was an inability to demonstrate value, which upon reflection I've got work to do to build out how we quantify the value of Vercel, which actually is very easily quantifiable. It's one of the things I love about selling this product, but we got to codify that for the go-to-market team. So that was incredibly interesting and now we run it against all of our lost opportunities and actually do a much better job of categorizing why it was we really, really lost.

(00:36:38):
And then either feeding that back into the engineering team or back into marketing sales leadership on, hey, where are we falling short in the sales process? And so that was awesome, but then we're like, well, it's not very fun to lose, so why don't we pull that forward? And so we went from lost bot to deal-bott and now the deal-bott is running in real time and we basically feed insights into Slack. Vercel is incredibly heavy users of Slack, so we have a channel for every single customer, either opportunity or existing one. And so now we're feeding insights into that Slack channel which is, "Hey, you're this far into the sales process and you haven't talked to an economic buyer, you should think about that." Or, "Hey, you just got off that call with an economic buyer, didn't sound like it went that well. Here's some things to consider and how you might follow-up."

(00:37:34):
And last thing before I pause, the other thing that's really interesting and how we're using this too is we are in this moment where I have never seen an iteration velocity exists now in my career. My 20 plus year career has all been in tech. And so for go-to-market teams, that's really hard. If you are launching something every other day, the ability to be enabled on that is actually quite challenging. And so this bot agent is now also letting us, where we're starting to go with it is we'll release something, we'll do our best to enable the team, then we'll go run the agent across calls, interactions, and we'll diagnose where we did a bad job of objection handling, where we're getting stuck. And then at the end of the week we can have a huddle and say, okay, what are all the places that our agent would suggest we aren't selling effectively?

(00:38:34):
And then almost like an engineering team, we'll now run sprints, which is like those are just bugs. They're bugs in your go-to-market process, so you should not have them. And by the next week we're going to add content to our objection handling to guide. We're going to add content to a discovery guide, we're going to figure out something we need to change about our demo, so on and so forth. So that's early. That's a little bit of a preview, but that's where we're talking about taking things right now within our go-to-market orgs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:00):
Jeanne, you're blowing my mind in so many ways, it just sounds so fun and just you guys are going to win is what I'm feeling when I hear all this. Incredible. What I love about this is this AI tool, this agent you built sees things that humans were not seeing. The fact that you were surprised of just like this is a completely different conclusion is such a big deal. This is the whole promise of ai, it's going to do things we aren't even thinking about or capable of.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:39:26):
It is. We had a really interesting, one of the things we're doing at Vercel, we have an AI cloud, so people use that to put AI-native features into their customer-facing applications, but they're also using it to build internal applications to improve productivity or outcomes. And we are talking to a very large airline and that airline obviously gets tons and tons of support queries. So of course they would want to go apply AI to hey, how can we have AI answer these so that our cost to support goes down, sort of the obvious thing. But the more interesting conversation was actually with one of the C-level executives who said, we also actually transcribe every single one of those support calls. And so what I really want to know is why are they calling and how do I make it so that fewer people call the next week? And so again, this is now with AI, you can rapidly go through all of that content and actually be able to much more quickly than having a human in your CRM sort of pick some status why it was that folks were calling the airline this week and what if anything you can do to make it less the case next week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:39):
I imagine many people hearing this are like, "I need one of these deal-botts and lost bots." These are all internal products that you all built?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:47):
Is there anything that you've learned about making them this good? Any tips you can share of here's how to make a really good bot for sales?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:40:54):
Yes, so actually that's the second half of my answer that I forgot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):
That's perfect.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:41:00):
Which is sort of like bill versus buy calculus. So I think one of our learnings is that it's not that hard to build these agents and they aren't that expensive either. So I mentioned the lead agent that was a six-week process with one human, a third of his time, that deal-bott, the lost bot version was two days basically we riffed on it, he had it 40 hours later. Now we're continuing to refine it for the other things I mentioned. And what's also interesting about them is they for better or for worse for Vercel, but that lead agent which runs full stack on Vercel, will cost us about a thousand dollars to run for the entire year. If you remember I told you we had 10 people in the SDR function, so I'm paying well over a million dollars for that from a salary perspective.

(00:41:57):
I got that down to one. And then behind that I have a lead agent that costs a thousand bucks. So that's like a 90%-plus reduction in total cost there. And there's lots of software for agents out there right now. And I think one of the things we're learning is because this whole space is so nascent, often your own esoteric context, your content, your workflow is really key to unlocking the power of the agent. And so I think there's real value in experimenting with your own internal agent development. We may ultimately end up on better integrated agent platforms in the fullness of time, or we may find that the CIO increasingly goes from a procurer of software to a builder of software and you'll have an AI internal platform with a thousand agents running across your org. I'm not really sure yet. But I certainly think there's value in trying it yourself because you may find that it's meaningfully easier than you think and you get returns pretty quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:10):
So what I'm hearing here is that you're finding that there are not tools out there to plug and play. The alpha is essentially in building your own stuff.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:43:18):
I think that's partially true, and I think because you also have all these tools proliferating right now, you get into the perennial problem where you wind up with 20 of them to do the 20 jobs to be done basically, rather than an integrated platform that's doing all of them. I'm hearing this a lot actually when I'm talking to customers right now where their biggest issue in deploying AI is actually just getting through procurement and it's because got an AI mandate, you kind of have a blank check. I recently heard the term of instead of ARR, it's ERR, which is experimental run rate revenue, which is to say everyone's out there sort of, Hey, we're going to give this thing a go for a year and then TBD on whether or not we keep it. But basically you're having to procure 20 different things. Most things are getting off the ground and so they're solving something relatively narrow and that'll change in the fullness of time. But I do think there's an opportunity to figure out, hey, where do I likely have a more specific workflow internally. For that it might be worth building your own agent and then maybe for the things that are a little bit more generalizable, you go get something off the shelf.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):
Are there any platforms or tools that you want to shout out that allow you to build these agents so quickly? I know they sit on Versel, so shout out Vercel. But just anything that you point people to you to... These SDR, these GTM engineers, they're former salespeople. Are they learning to code? Are they byte coding these agents? How does that work?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:44:52):
So our sales engineers all have CS degrees. So they were engineers in a sales capacity, so they're writing code and actually these agents, they're building directly on Versel. So you get the AI gateway that lets you call different models. You have a sandbox if you're running untrusted code, you've got workflows that let you build the process. You've got fluid compute, which lets you really efficiently use compute when you only need it. So we're just sort of building it from the ground up here. Again, it's not that hard. Now you do need to write code for that. Certainly there are a lot of vibe coding tools out there that also give you more workflow builders that are somewhere between fully WYSIWYG, almost like drag and drop and a little bit more code forward. So you've got a bunch out there along those lines. But I do think we've sort of found one of the reasons actually the GTM Eng team at Versel can build these agents so easily is because the Versel platform is making it that easy to use our framework to find infrastructure and get that agent onto into production very rapidly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:11):
What a neat, unfair advantage you all have to do this stuff.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:13):
Yes, it is fun to... I mean, I do think this company is better than any I've seen at eating its own dog food and just everyone is constantly, we say Versel builds Versel with Versel. So you're just always looking for ways to, Hey, how can we use our product to go do what we need to do? And as a result, either understand then what a customer would want or what's missing from our product that we could go make better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):
Along these lines, something that's already come across a lot in the way that you described this stuff is I've heard a lot about how you think about go-to-market as a product. A lot of people listening to this, as I've said, are product builders. So I think this is a really nice way of thinking about go-to-market. I'm guessing you've already talked about elements of this, but just what's a way to think about go-to-market as a product?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:46:56):
Yeah, I've always, so I had this realization probably a little over a decade ago in my career. So my first job out of college was working on Gmail in 2004. So Gmail launched on April 1st, I joined on June 1st. And as I'm sure you'll remember as well, Gmail was this incredible innovation, massive JavaScript application that didn't really exist at the time. And it had this gig of storage. It was a full year before Yahoo Mail caught up and even longer before Hotmail and others did. So that was the level of technical differentiation between Gmail and the next best. And a decade later, you had cloud computing enabling folks to do stuff that you never would've been able to do previously. And so I kind of felt like, huh, software's starting to commoditize a little bit. And so when that happens, when technical differentiation kind of narrows, what are other things that will differentiate you?

(00:48:01):
And I was started thinking outside of tech, we buy a lot of things because of how we feel about them. And so I started to develop this thesis that actually the experience that you have of being sold to will increasingly actually differentiate a company and drive buying decisions if products are only different at the margin. And so if you believe that, then you really want to create a customer buying journey that feels like very unique experiences. And so we did a lot of this at Stripe and now we're looking to replicate this here. But an example of one of the things I think we did really nicely at Stripe was a lot of companies sales, the first call after you're qualified, we've decided you're worth engaging in sales process is discovery, which is basically let me ask you a lot of questions to try to under-uncover paint, figure out where buying power lies, et cetera.

(00:49:03):
And so that is kind of boring sometimes for a customer. You're basically being quizzed often on the phone. And so what we started to do at Stripe was that first session was a whiteboarding session, and we would actually get together and have you draw your architecture for payments and all the other things that were under the hood to enable you to take money and drive customer outcomes. And through that we would learn a ton about what was in your stack, what we were going to have to compete with, displace where value lied. But the customer also learned a lot themselves because in many cases they'd never drawn their architecture diagram. And so they left that meeting with an asset and a sense of like, "Wow, this is a really collaborative person who's deeply interested in helping me develop a mental model for how to think about this." And then we had other things that we would do.

(00:50:00):
So that's sort of how I think about building go-to-market-like a product is basically you need to go through from the first time you become aware that the company exists to again, that sort of five-year heavily retained wall-to-wall customer a set of experiences. And those experiences can feel transactional, flat, boring, or they can feel very human, personalized and unique. And so we try to go map those out and figure out how do you bring the product to bear, make it really human, and hopefully that creates a customer for life in the end.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):
I love that whiteboarding example. Are there any other examples of what you've done to make it actually work really well in this way?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:50:43):
Yeah. Another principle, we really developed this at Stripe too and I brought it to Vercel, was just the idea of adding value at any touch point regardless of whether or not that customer bought. Because even if customers don't buy, you often find that if you miss them on that buying cycle, three or four years later when they're in another buying cycle, they do come back. I was at Stripe for nine years and so I saw the number of customers that we lost and then half a decade later, here they are and they bought. So that was sort of another one. So examples of this that were doing at Vercel is there's great data on the internet that helps people understand the performance of their website and how fast your website is actually impacts SEO. And SEO impacts AEO and everybody's thinking about AEO right now. And, so one of the things we try to do when we reach out is actually give folks insight immediately into how they're performing on an absolute basis, how they're performing relative to peers. So ideally that piques your interest and you want to learn more from us, but even if it doesn't, you still have insights that you may or may not have been aware of that maybe make you contemplate whether or not you've got the optimal setup.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:07):
Awesome. So what I'm hearing here is when you say, think of it like a product that's basically a product person thinks about the experience of their product, that every step of the journey, here's the flow, step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, how do we make every step awesome, keep them going along that journey. And so what you think about is just from the prospect's perspective, how do we make every step of that journey awesome, continue them down that journey.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:30):
Yeah. How do you make it be an experience rather than a transaction

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:35):
Versus just feel like sales coming at you trying to sell you stuff?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:37):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:38):
Okay. Staying along this track of staying tactical, I want to go even further there. So what are just some go-to-market tactics that you find really effective these days for people trying to just to be more successful in getting people to pay attention to their stuff, to buy their stuff?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:52:57):
I mean, one I would sort of say dovetails with where I just ended, but is what are the unique insights that you can bring to bear about your product or how that customer may be in a suboptimal state? So I do think investing in data to tease that out is one thing. I think the other thing this is straightforward but often not done enough is a lot of good companies invest in docs, good thing to do, but they stop there. And particularly if you are selling into a slightly larger company doing things like, AWS calls it well-architected guides or blueprints, a lot of customers, particularly larger ones, really want to know the best practice for how exactly to implement your product with their particular setup. A great example of this, this is from Stripe, was Stripe was excellent at marketplaces. Most, Lyft, Instacart, DoorDash, they were all on Stripe.

(00:54:07):
And so Stripe definitely knew the best way to set up payments for a marketplace because we'd seen them all. And so when you then would go and sell a marketplace and say, "Oh yeah, we've got docs, go check them out." They didn't like that, because they're like, "Hey, every marketplace runs on Stripe. I don't want to look at generic docs. I want you to tell me what's the best way to set up payments for a marketplace." And so I think that's another key thing to be doing, particularly as you move past that sort of solo developer startup founder as potentially a target audience.

(00:54:39):
And then, I don't know if this is a tactic per se, but I do think just a good reminder for founders in particular who are still in that maybe founder-led sales moment is just the value of really good discovery. I often find founders are so excited about talking about their product or you ask one question and now they've got a hook of like, oh, I can fix that for you. But excellent salespeople typically will talk well under half the time in a conversation because they're out asking questions, probing often helping a customer arrive at conclusions on their own. And so learning how to do five why's, go deep rather than immediately going into problem solving mode. If they ask a question, you respond often. If they ask a question, you should ask a question about the question and then respond. So learning to be great at that, I think differentiates people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:43):
So the last tip, I think there's something a lot of I bet everyone could learn is just listen more and talk less.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:55:48):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):
On that first piece of advice, this kind of sharing unique insights and how your suboptimal, is there an example you could share of how you did that? Maybe a story of just how you convinced someone you're selling Striper or Vercel like care or something you're missing. Here's how this could help you become much better.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:56:04):
So with Vercel, sort of giving an example, but I'll make it more specific. So the performance point, you can go and look at core web Vitals, and so we can actually see the different things within their site that are fast or load correctly, et cetera, so anyone can go look that up. But what we can do is actually then help with benchmarking relative to peers. So that's been a big one that we've gone out and done. The other one that we've spent some good time on is just around helping customers understand MCP servers and when it would make sense to use one. So I think those are all the rage, but often people don't know how to contemplate them within their own product. So that was another one that we've gone pretty deep on and then related to, the first one is AEO Answer engine optimization is actually somewhat tangential to Vercel right.

(00:57:09):
So we drive performance, performance drives SEO. SEO is an input into AEO, but we have spent a ton of time sharing insights on AEO because we ourselves focus deeply on it and think we understand it better than many. And so again, as part of just building a trusted relationship, folks may go from those AMAs or that content into, okay, great, you taught me a lot and therefore I want Vercel to help me with performance. But in many cases, they actually now are just like, "This is a company that seems insightful, it seems like one I can learn from, and now I'm going to pay a little bit more attention to them." And over the fullness of time, maybe they see something that triggers them to decide, "Now is the time I want to go investigate that aspect of Vercel."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:55):
Awesome. So what I'm hearing here in many ways, and this resonates, I had Jenna Abel on the podcast recently and it was all about sales skills and how to sell.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:02):
Nice.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
And one of her tips is you don't want to be focusing on here's the pain and problem we're solving and instead focus on here's how you will be better than your competitors. Here's the big gap and alpha that you can achieve. If you use Vercel, you were missing out on speed and you're going to get screwed in AEO and all these things. Here's how you can architect your entire payments system to be top tier. Does that resonate?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (00:58:27):
Yeah, I was told this stat. It's round numbers, so I can't imagine it's entirely accurate, but basically that customers, 80% of customers buy to avoid pain or reduce risk as opposed to the other one out of five to increase upside, which is a good thing again for startup founders to understand. So we all love to talk about the art of the possible, everything we're going to enable in the future. It's very exciting. Everyone's visionaries, but that's often really a sale that's going to resonate with another founder. And for everybody else, particularly enterprises, you're avoiding the risk of not making your revenue target next quarter, the risk of being outdone by the competition, the risk of having brand damage, et cetera. And so it's really hard actually for many startups to make that pivot because it feels off brand, but it does actually drive more buying behavior, is setting up a little bit of that concern that either I might not be well positioned or again through good question asking. I know exactly where I'm not well positioned and you can help me, that

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):
That is such an important stat you shared. This has come up actually before in this podcast that buying, people are buying in large part to reduce risks, to basically not hurt themselves in their career, not hurt the company. That's a bigger factor in the buying decision than, "I have this problem I need to solve. And okay, thank you, this is solving." And the way April Dunford came in the podcast and talked about this of just like it's such a massive career bet. We are going to bring in product X and it's going to become, like Stripe, let's say, let's not talk about Versel. But let's say Stripe, we're going to adopt Stripe. That's a huge decision. If it doesn't go well, your career is hurt, your manager is going to be mad at you, it's going to set your company back. So a lot of the buying decision, as you've said is I just don't want to screw this up.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:36):
Right. Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):
Okay. Along the line of tactics, something that I know you're a big fan of and help people think about is segmentation.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:45):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):
This is something a lot of founders struggle with. They know, "Okay, I need to figure out my segmentation strategy and here where we're going after." Can you just give us a primer on segmentation, what people should know about why this is important and then how they might approach this.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:00:59):
So segmentation is basically how do you carve up the world of companies that exist on the planet to reason about them where they buy differently? So I'll give examples from Stripe and Versel to bring this home. So a very typical company segmentation is small, medium, large. That's a rational way to do things. Small, you often have a single decision maker, medium, a small team, and large, it's complex, it's a committee, et cetera. So the buying process does change across SMB, mid-market enterprise, but if you stop there, you are likely missing. But what are the things within your offering that also change the way something gets sold? So at Stripe, there were two ways we further cut the business. Way one was, so think of segmentation as a graph. So X-Access was size, so small, medium, large, y-access was growth potential. And that was important for Stripe because it was a consumption-based business.

(01:02:10):
So if you were going to grow at 200% year-on-year, you were more valuable to Stripe than if you were going to grow at 8% year-on-year. And so we wanted to spend more time, spend more money going after the 200% growers than the 8%. So that was one that informed your strategy on who you targeted. And then for Stripe, the other thing that we cut it was business model. So are you a B2B? Are you B2C? Are you B2B2B, E.G. a platform or B2B2C, E.G. a marketplace and why is that relevant? Well, if you're B2B, you are going to need business payments. Credit card was useful for a PLG function or PLG sale, but you were going to need ACH wires, etc. And you probably had a recurring business, so you were going to want Stripe billing. If you were B2C, that's consumer.

(01:03:00):
So you're going to want consumer payments. Apple Pay is super important. If you were in the platform or the marketplace, you were going to buy our connect product. So it helped us basically then craft a more targeted and replicable sales. Vercel, sort of similar deals. So small, medium, large buying complexity. We also do the same thing on growth potential because we are similarly a consumption based business, but for us, a couple other things on the X-axis, we layer in promote, which is one of the things that is observable is traffic, site traffic on the internet. So Google publishes a Crux score, which is basically they have a bunch of data in Chrome, and so they know that Lenny's site gets a million XC amount-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:48):
Millions.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:03:48):
... volume that Jeanne's site does. And so basically if you are a small company but you have super high traffic that's going to be more complex, Vercel is going to make more money and so we want to promote you.

(01:04:02):
So great example of this would be OpenAI. OpenAI, I forget these days how many employees it has. Let's say it's 3,000, it's probably more than that at this point, but so that's going to put it in the mid-market at most companies, but they're a top 25 traffic site on the internet. So for us, that's going to push them in our enterprise because we need to go lean in with a much more in depth sales process. And then the other thing we layer on is a workload type. So if you are an e-commerce company, that's going to be a very different sale. You actually use different language. You talk about product listing pages and product description pages, and you've got an order management system as the back end. Super different from a crypto company where you might be running soup to nuts on AWS. And so again, that helps us start to then have a really different buying content for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):
Okay, this is awesome. So essentially what you do is you break up this universe coming back to your original story at Stripe to help you sort essentially which companies are most likely to buy your product. And what you're coming up with is these attributes that are correlated with they're likely to be great potential customers.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:22):
Yep.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):
Do you recommend using this XY axis as the approach versus something else? There's like a spreadsheet with five columns. I don't know, how do you start?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:05:31):
There's probably something to be said for X and Y. like do you think size is going to play into most buying decisions and then these days there is a fair amount of consumption happening? So there'll be aspects of this that I think are somewhat universal. But I think basically when I came to Vercel, because new product market product offering, for me it's a new market. I had a lot to learn, but this is one of the first things I did in the first 30 days. And so basically I sat down with the gentleman Abhi who leads data science here and said, okay, what drives revenue? So what are the things that you can look at X ante about a customer to know this person's likely to pay us a hundred thousand dollars versus a million? That's probably going to be part of a segmentation framework. And then similarly, okay, what attributes would we look for to cluster where we seem to be winning repeatedly? And that was how we ultimately got at, okay, Crux rank is going to be super important because what you pay Vercel is correlated with your traffic. And then workload type was super important as well.

(01:06:46):
And for Vercel, when we did that, it was really interesting because we saw, wow, we have a lot of penetration and e-comm not that surprising actually, given that we drive highly performant sites and e-comm having a superfast performance site really matters. But at the time, if you looked at as an example, an enterprise SaaS companies, we didn't have a lot of penetration, even though you would've thought, okay, front-end cloud, very developer oriented. Of course software companies would be on us, but in enterprise, most of those companies built that SaaS offering before Vercel existed. So migrating 2 million lines of code to Vercel, that's a big lift. So it helped us really understand where are we winning, where are we not? And now as an example, within SaaS companies and enterprise, we're actually seeing a lot of interest in the AI cloud. Those are some of the earlier adopters of, "Hey, let's add AI native functionality to our existing SaaS app." And so again, it helps us figure out what to target where.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):
So essentially you're doing this regression analysis on what's working and then here's the attributes that are most correlated with success. Something I always recommend when founders ask me for how do I figure out my CPE? How do I figure out where to focus, my heuristic is just think of three attributes that narrow them down. So it's like series A company that's angel-led, that's the marketplace, something like that. Does that feel like a good just rule of thumb just to start?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:08:18):
Yeah, I think beyond three, that's getting pretty detailed and reasonably speaking, you're not going to cut. You have five sellers. So, what, you're going to put one seller in five different segments? So I do think three is something you can reason about. The other thing I'll say on this topic that I think is really important is a lot of times folks think segmentation is a go-to market thing. I really think it's a company thing. So when you Vercel, I actually deliver and every new hires first week, one of our company values is KYC, know your customer and I deliver the KYC section and talk through our segmentation framework how our customer base maps into those segments because it's really important as those new product managers leave the room that when they're building something, they think to themselves, okay, I'm building a new back end product. Who is this targeted at? Is it targeted at an enterprise or a startup? Basically, do I have a point of view on where I'm trying to win and why? And if you're doing that out of the gates, then it's much easier to then go speak the same language with the go to market org and figure out, okay, how are we going to take that to market in line with the other emotions that we have in play?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:36):
Okay, this is a great segue to, there's a couple other things I want to talk about. One is something I've heard from so many people you've worked with is that you are amazing at building a go-to-market org that works really well with product and engineering. So I'll read this quote from your former colleague, Kate Jensen. She said that your superpower is building a sales org that doesn't feel like a sales org to engineers. So the question she suggested asked just what does it take to do that? What are the ingredients to building a sales org that engineers and product teams really like working with?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:09:59):
The litmus test I have always given my sales team is if you are an account executive in my org and I put you in front of 10 engineers at our company, it should take them 10 minutes to figure out you aren't a product manager. And what I'm trying to get across is you need to have incredible product depth. And the reason for that is twofold. One, it gives you credibility with the product and engineering org. And two, I also believe that the best go-to-market orgs on the planet are equal parts revenue driving and R&D and D. And the reason I emphasize the latter is if you think about a product management organization, you may have a UXR team out doing research, product managers certainly should be out talking to customers. Well, if I have a 20-person sales team, think of the number of customers that we talk to in a week. And so if we can do an excellent job of translating all of that feedback into signal and then feeding that into the road map, we can be actually an extension of the product management org. But that takes being really good at discerning signal from noise, understanding when something is an objection that should be overcome versus an opportunity in the market. So I think those things have helped.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:27):
I just love this as a product manager, maybe form a product manager. I don't know what the hell I am these days. I just love the idea of the salesperson. Like you not knowing the difference between a product manager and a salesperson. The most classic challenge is sales orgs ask for all these features and PMs are constantly having to push back and think about does this fit into everything. So it feels like that's a big part of this is to understand that deeply.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:11:51):
Yeah, you want a sales org that can think like a general manager, so that's not just trying to get deals done but is trying to help build a business. And so again, knows when to say no, knows when to do objection handle versus knows, Hey, I've actually heard this on the last three calls and I do think this would be a really big unlock that would make us more competitive, would be something that new that nobody's doing. So I think that takes looking for a profile that both has sales skills but also is going to think with that product mindset.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
I love that. Okay, so another quote from Claire Hughes Johnson, former podcast guest, amazing sales leader, worked with you at Stripe. She said something along these lines, but a little different. Jeanne is probably the best go-to-market person at connecting with product and engineering, deeply understanding the product and providing the most valuable input to her counterparts of any I've ever seen. It sounds like just another ingredient here is just sales feeling like a real partner to product engineering actually, not just being like, "Hey, do these things for me, but actually feeling like a partner."

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:13:01):
Ultimately company strategy is basically product strategy meets go-to market strategy. And so I spend guess as a go-to market leader, I'm constantly trying to figure out how do I make more money more efficiently? And you typically do that by having a winning product in the market that is well commercialized. And so that means that I really lean into thinking about product strategy and thinking about pricing strategy because if those two things are optimal, you're going to win more often and there'll be less friction in it. And so that's sort of where got to put as a revenue leader, like a GM hat on and not just think, how do I sell? But actually how do I enable the insights I'm getting from talking to customers constantly to have the company strategy be more effective?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:00):
Speaking of product, going in a slightly different direction, PLG product-led growth, it felt like it was very hot for a while where everyone's like, "You got to go PLG, that's the only way to win. It's impossible to do sales. The future is PLG." It feels like that's gone away. And in large part, obviously still companies grow through PLG and work through PLG. What's just kind of your thoughts on PLG and when does it make sense for a company these days to actually think this is how they'll grow for a while?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:14:28):
PLG makes sense for a lot of companies at the outset, unless you are very explicitly building a product for enterprise. So Sierra as an example, right? They are very clearly going after Global 2000 or something close to that. PLG is not going to be overly useful to them because they are trying to win eight-figure deals from day one. But for a lot of products, folks are targeting a startup audience at the outset and then they're adding more functionality so that they can ultimately continue to scale up market. So I think PLG is still super relevant. It's a major driver of Vercels growth. It was a big driver of Stripe's growth. The thing that folks get wrong is it does typically have a ceiling. So people are generally not going to give you $1 million via self-serve flow. So at some point if you want to sustain growth rates, you're going to have to have your deal sizes get bigger and bigger. And where I think folks get stuck is waiting too long on PLG because it does take a while to build a replicable sales process and a sales process, which often you're getting fed by inbound at the beginning and then you got to add outbound. It takes a while actually to turn outbound into a predictable engine. So I think where you see companies hit walls is just when they don't add the sales portion of it soon enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:00):
So essentially every company ends up having to build a sales org, some start product-led and then at sales, some just start sales and have it from the beginning.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:09):
Yeah, I would agree. There are probably some good examples of large vertical SaaS platforms that are SMB, but even they wind up with Velocity sales team. So yeah, I don't know that I can think of a 100 billion company that's PLG-only.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):
Yeah, it just feels like you're leaving money on the table even if you are growing really fast. I know Atlassian was a long-time PLG company but eventually succumbed. I don't know if that's the right way to put it. Okay. You mentioned pricing. I know you have strong opinions on pricing and pricing strategy. What's just a couple of tips you might share with someone thinking about how to price their product?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:16:52):
Yeah, this is kind of on the theme, but I think the first thing is you got to think about pricing like a product. So it's another one where it actually really matters how you choose to price a product. Do you really understand where customers are going to drive value? Do you really understand where you incur costs? And are you doing a smart job of aligning those things? You've got lots of examples of companies grossly underpricing, you're sort of afraid to charge for the value that you actually provide. I think there are a lot of examples where people default to including a freemium strategy without that actually being a strategy. A good example at Stripe, we launched Stripe Billings years ago. It had a freemium strategy because that's what you do. And then we sort of looked at it and we're like, "actually integrating straight billing takes a little bit of work.So if you do that, you're probably going to stay."

(01:17:56):
And so we killed that, killed the free trial to zero downside. So that's another one. At Vercel, we've been going through that transition where we're a consumption-based business model ultimately, but at the outset we basically kind of bundled that into what looked like a SaaS-like price and as we've added a lot more functionality that wasn't working anymore. And so we did an unbundling and right now actually we did a pretty substantial pricing change in August where we have an enterprise at a pro-skew. And if you looked at the enterprise skew, it's called Enterprise for a reason, enter, it's meant to be sold to an enterprise. And actually about half of the folks on the enterprise skew were startups, which suggests that there's stuff in the enterprise skew that a startup really wants. So we kicked a lot of that stuff out of the enterprise skew and made it so you could buy it self-serve online and what do you know, people are.

(01:19:03):
So now that's really driven a lot of growth in our PLG funnel, which is awesome for startups because it's super efficient. They can just buy things, they want that. It's awesome for us because you don't have to have a human intermediate that. So getting all of these knobs really tuned is a key to both a great customer experience and optimal revenue outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):
Maybe just one more question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. It's going to be a combo question. I hear you have a hot take on sales comp, how to comp salespeople that's different from other people and also who to hire when you're hiring folks in sales. Can you just talk about your takes there?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:19:41):
I struggle with sales comp because it's all about pay for performance, which I'm obviously a fan of, but it makes your organization less flexible because you basically have to decide 12 months in advance, these are things I value and particularly in this moment that could be different. As a great example of this, when we wrote the sales plans for this year at Vercel, the AI cloud did not exist. We were selling our front-end cloud and we were selling VZero and introduced the AI cloud halfway through the year. Now we had all sorts of good ways to still incentivize that, but I think you want to be able to be innovative and pivot and when you have a well-designed sales plan or a very structured sales plan, that can be challenging.

(01:20:44):
So that's a little bit of my hot take is just I'm trying to figure out how do you have the upside of sales of motivates people. It's a quantitative function, which is great, but also the flexibility to change your mind because I think a lot of companies right now are having a hard time doing annual planning. So that's one. On profiles, I have always valued just sort of a diversified portfolio. So I strongly believe that sales is a skill and so you want salespeople with actual sales experience in your organization, but I think there's value in pairing them with more nontraditional backgrounds, in particular consulting or banking background. Those folks are really good at more quantitative and analytical aspects of sales. So getting into that consultative part, which I think we talked about at the outset. And so I find that when you mix these together, the sort of consultant banker profile realizes, "Oh wait a minute, sales is a skill and I didn't really have it." And so they go learn from your account executives with that background and then your AEs learn more about, okay, how do I think about a P&L? How can I talk to a CFO? How do I present a TCO analysis more effectively? And so just creates a much richer learning environment where people are bouncing ideas off each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:22):
That is awesome. I love that strategy. Okay, final question. Just is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:31):
Oh man. I feel like we've been very thorough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:34):
All right, thanks So too.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:35):
Yeah, you stumped me on that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:38):
Okay. That's the goal. With that Jean, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to make it very quick. I know you got to run. I'm going to ask you just two questions.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:46):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):
One is I'm going to skip to your life motto. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in worker and life?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:22:54):
I do. I actually have found that I'm known for saying a handful of things that I didn't necessarily realize it, but when you leave an organization, people tend to tell you what stuck with them. But there is one that I think I am known for saying growing up, my mom always said to me, when the going gets tough, the tough get going. And in sales, you're always going to have a quarter when you're not on pace. And so that's one that I feel like I pull on, not infrequently because in my view, there's another version of this, my mom also always says was where there's a will, there's a way. So I think you can always choose to find a path forward even when that's not super clear.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:45):
I love these. Okay, last question. I read that you were a very competitive diver in college early on. I'm just curious if there's something you learned from that experience that brought with you that helps you be as successful as you've become?

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:23:59):
Well, I mean, first of all, I should say I was generally coming in third place out of three on my team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):
Third place, that's not bad.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:24:07):
I managed to do it in college, but that was the extent of that career. So diving is a precision sport and it is a repetitive sport. And it is also a sport where when you land flat on your back, and literally as you are swimming to the side of the pool, welts are forming on it, you always 100% of the time will be forced to immediately get back on the diving board and do that exact same dive again. And so I think that has a lot of stuff that's transferable to work and to sales. So for me, I just have an obsession with excellence and within sales. sales is about replicability. How do you drive predictable outcomes, how excellent are you at your ability to forecast? And so I think I bring that to bear within sales a lot. And then similarly, you get a lot of nos in sales. So another phrase that a sales guru said to me once or in a training was yeses are great, nos are great, maybes will kill you. And so how do you get really comfortable that no is a great thing and that just gave you data and now you can go do something with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:25):
This is a really inspiring and empowering way to end the conversation. Jean, thank you so much for being here.

Jeanne DeWitt Grosser (01:25:33):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.

# The paths to power: How to grow your influence and advance your career | Jeffrey Pfeffer (Stanford)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're going to be talking about how to grow your power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:02):
The reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being less stressed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):
You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:15):
Not only is, but how it was and how it will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
The Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:32):
This is not about personality. These are skills they can be mastered.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):
People might be hearing this and they're like, "I don't want to be this person."

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:38):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one. That is one way to get in our own way. If I think power is dirty, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
The opening quote to your book that I have here, if you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:00:58):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford's graduate School of Business, and teaches one of the two most popular and oversubscribed courses in all of the MBA program, called the Paths to Power. The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it. In our conversation, we dig into each of the seven powers, why it's important to build these skills even if you feel uncomfortable.

(00:01:48):
We talk through a bunch of examples of the power in action and the impact it has had on people's lives, why it isn't as cringey or scary as you may think. I was actually nervous to have this conversation and I ended up being a huge fan of Jeffrey and the work that he does. We end the conversation with what you can start doing today to start building your own power. This podcast is basically for anyone that wants to advance in their career, whether you're an IC or a CEO, and I'm really excited to bring it to you. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jeffrey Pfeffer. Jeffrey, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:02:36):
Thank you, Lenny. I am honored that you invited me on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
I'm even more honored that you decided to come on. We're going to be talking about something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. I think it's going to make me uncomfortable. We're going to be talking about how to grow your power in life and in business. Let me just start by asking why does this stuff make people uncomfortable, and why is it still important for people to learn how to do this well?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:02):
Well, it's important because a guy named Gerald Ferris developed a scale of political skill. And he and a bunch of his colleagues over the years did a lot of empirical research that demonstrates that political skill is associated with a lot of positive outcomes, salary, getting promoted, being happy in your career, being happy in your job, being less stressed. So the reason why you should pay attention to this is because it leads to a lot of good things. The reason why it makes people uncomfortable. You said it made you uncomfortable. Maybe I should ask you the question, why does it make you uncomfortable?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:44):
There's a lot of things here that are probably not how people want to live their life necessarily, or want other people to act.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:03:51):
Yeah, so I think it makes people uncomfortable because the realities of what it takes to get power bear almost no resemblance to what you're taught in Sunday school or the mosque or wherever, how your parents raised you. They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:56):
You also have this quote that the people who need to understand power and build their power skills are people who come from backgrounds or characteristics who would normally put them at a disadvantage.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:05:04):
I think that's exactly right. I will go this Sunday to Nashville Tennessee to talk to a bunch of people of color in the NFL who are trying to rise up the ranks. Stanford runs a program because the NFL is serious, I think, about trying to make more opportunity for people, underrepresented minorities. But these are folks who will not succeed unless they learn power skills, because the world is stacked against them in lots of ways.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):

(00:07:51):
Another element of your course that you try to make clear in your syllabus is to teach people not to be as judgmental. You also have this whole huge bold phrase, "This class is not for everyone." Can you just talk a bit about maybe why it's not for everyone and then why being less judgmental is important?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:08:07):
The class is extremely popular. I have a long waiting list. It's kind of mythical. And because of the principle of social influence, we are influenced by what other people do. We're influenced in our choices of restaurants, we're influenced in our choices of music. I'm not sure I like Taylor Swift, but I certainly want to go see Taylor Swift because everybody else is. And many people sign up for the class. And one year in particular, there were some people who sat in about the third row up, directly in front of me, and they looked every day like they were having some terrible thing put up some horrible orifice or something. They looked literally in pain, and so I decided, and of course they learned nothing. If you come to the class and you're in that much psychological discomfort, you're not going to learn anything.

(00:08:55):
And so what I try to do is tell people that in order to benefit from this class, you have to be open to learning the material. And if you're not, and by the way, this would be true for any class. If you go to physics and you say, I don't like physics, I hate physics, I don't believe in physics, I don't believe in the theory of physics, whatever, you're not going to learn anything. And so I'm trying to get the class, given those huge waiting lists, I'm trying to get the class to have people in it who are in fact going to benefit from it rather than sit there and look like they're in pain. And the judgmental thing, if Matthew 7, "Judge not that ye be not judged." The Koran says, "Only Allah can judge people." The American poet, Walt Whitman said, "Be curious, not judgmental."

(00:09:46):
Mother Teresa said, "If you judge people, you have no time to love them." Judgment, if I need to build a positive relationship with Lenny because you are on my critical path in my job, and jobs necessarily entail a reasonable amount of interdependence, I get things done through and with other people. If I decide that Lenny is whatever set of bad adjectives you want to use, dumb, incompetent, immoral, whatever, my ability to build a positive relationship with you, and you remain on my critical path, becomes almost zero unless you're a better actor or I'm a better actor than I think most people are.

(00:10:32):
So therefore, you should suspend judgment in the sense that if somebody is on your critical path, the only judgment you should make is they're on my critical path. If I want to get something done, I need their collaboration and cooperation, and the fact that I may not like them is in fact irrelevant. And as I have taught senior executives over the years, it is absolutely clear to me that one of the skills that they have mastered is they have a skill that you cannot tell what they think of you. And that's important because I need your collaboration, I need your cooperation. And if I leak out in ways that say I don't respect you or I don't like you, I don't admire you, whatever, my odds of getting you to work productively with me goes essentially to zero. So that's a judgmental story. Does that make sense?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:21):
Absolutely. And I have a quote from your syllabus along these lines, "Not everyone we encounter in Paths to Power is someone you're going to want to emulate. This is a class about how to get things done, how to build and wield influence, and there are multiple ways to accomplish these objectives." So I've had two friends actually go through the course. One I asked about the course of the impact it had on her. She's actually a founder now. And she told me that your class was her single most favorite class at all of Stanford Business School, because it was realistic and applicable to life as a founder. Because it didn't sugarcoat business, didn't sugarcoat life. It told her how the world really works and it is helping her succeed with her startup right now.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:00):
Thank you. There's no higher praise than that. I actually don't read, I shouldn't probably say this on the public, but I don't actually read my course evaluations because the impact I want to have is not to have people like me, but to have that kind of impact. To make people more successful, more effective in their lives.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:22):
That is a good segue to one of your rules of power. So let's just talk about your Seven Rules of Power. I actually have your book right here and if folks want to learn more, here it is, Seven Rules of Power. This is your fourth book about power, and this is your best book about power, because it basically summarizes everything you've learned in a really cohesive way. So let me first share the Seven Rules of Power and then I'm going to dive into a few of them. Does that sound good?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:12:44):
That sounds perfect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:45):
Okay, so the seven rules, one, get out of your own way. Two, break the rules. Three, appear powerful. Four, build a powerful brand. Network relentlessly. Use your power, and success excuses almost...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:01):
Everything, correct.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):
Okay, success excuses everything almost. Got it. Okay. So let me start with power four, which is around personal brand. And the reason I want to start here is I have a friend that's actually in your class right now, Ralph, and I saw that he started a podcast. And he told me that he did it because it was part of the homework that you give students. You call it Doing Power. Is that the name of the homework assignments?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:13:25):
Yeah, I have. So we give them a bunch of assignments throughout the class, which are self-reflective assignments, but their big thing for the class is they have to do power. They have to do something during the quarter to take the principles of the class, and what they're learning, and put them into practice. And that is because everything I do, I do for a reason. That is because if you don't use what you learn, the learning will disappear. So if you go to a French class and you learn French, and you never speak French, in about a relatively short period of time you'll forget everything you learn. And so I want the learning to stick with them, so I try to get them to do something with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:06):
While we're on this tangent, I wanted to talk about this whole, you have a book, the Doing Knowing Gap.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:10):
Knowing-Doing Gap.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
The Knowing-Doing Gap. So let's just spend a little time there. I think that's really important. What are some examples of things that have come out of people doing these homework assignments, things that maybe led to something interesting?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:14:22):
Let me take my most extreme example. My most extreme example is probably Derek Kan, K-A-N. And Derek Kan was a little bit older when he went through the MBA program. And in 2012, his Doing Power project was to get appointed to be Mitt Romney's, it was Mitt Romney was running for president, to be head of economic policy for the Romney campaign. Believe it or not, he was offered the job. Believe it or not, he turned it down for reasons which we could go into if you want, but aren't that interesting. He wound up relatively soon thereafter as number three in the transportation department, working for Elaine Chao. And I have a picture of him when he comes to the class, I introduce him. I tell students, I give them a trigger warning and I introduce him. He wound up, at the end of the Trump administration, as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. And since typical of the Trump administration, by that time there was no director. He essentially ran the $6 trillion US budget. This is six years out of business school.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):
I was thinking whether he got that during his class. Amazing. Okay, so this is a success story of Doing Power. Let's talk about this first power of building brand, and I think this is where people start to feel uncomfortable. They're going to be like, oh no, I don't want to be doing this. This doesn't feel good to me.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:51):
Why?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:52):
So let's talk about it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:53):
Okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:54):
Let's see. So talk about this power of building a personal brand.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:15:58):
There are by definition fewer positions at the top than at the bottom. The world, we might not like this, and I know people, the late Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tried to do holacracy or whatever, but the world is essentially hierarchical. The animal kingdom is hierarchical. It is better to be at the top than at the bottom for a number of reasons. Okay. If that is true, if there are fewer positions at the top and then at the bottom, then your job to advance your career is to figure out how to get promoted. There are many ways to get promoted, but I will guarantee you one thing, no one is going to promote Lenny if they don't know who the hell you are. So it is not sufficient for them to know who you are. They have to know that you're smart and personable and have whatever skills you've got, but they have to know you.

(00:16:52):
If they don't know you, you cannot choose what is not in your head. You know that better than I do. So therefore you have to do something to differentiate yourself. You have to build a brand. So when I think of Lenny in your podcast, I think of something. Not just 25 billion podcasts. When I think of somebody in McKinsey or Bay or BCG, one of the consulting firms, a gazillion people start off as front-line consultants. What are you going to do so that somebody knows who you are? What are you going to do that creates value for the firm and for you? So my friend Keith Ferazzi, when he started at Deloitte Consulting, did not do the spreadsheet stuff that he was, by the way, not very good at and didn't like. He started the Lincoln Quality Award. He decided to try to take Deloitte's brand recognition from about one or 2% to 30%.

(00:17:54):
He was appointed, though he left before he actually took the job, to the position of partner and the first chief marketing officer at Deloitte. I have another friend, Tristan Walker, who wanted to get hired at Foursquare. He sent emails to the founder. The founder ignored him. So Tristan Walker did something I think very bold. Tristan Walker began signing up partnerships. So one day the founder says, holy God, he signed up Starbucks. Maybe I ought to hire this guy. So you have to do something that causes people to know who you are, and that is what building a brand is about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:36):
It sounds very benign put that way. When people hear, I need to build a personal brand, it sounds like I need to post on LinkedIn, I need to post on Twitter, start a newsletter, start a podcast, which I know is kind of a part of it. But what are some examples you've seen of ways to build a personal brand that are effective?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:18:50):
So I have a friend who I bring to the class, a lovely tall Asian woman named Laura Chau, who made partner at a venture capital firm after four years, which is fast. Laura works for Canaan Partners, C-A-N-A-A-N. Laura said, I do not work for Andreessen Horowitz, I do not work for Sequoia, I don't work for Greylock, I don't work for any of these very visible large VC firms. So if I am going to get deals in the consumer space, that's her domain of expertise is consumer and consumer tech, somebody is going to have to know who Laura Chau is. Because again, you're not going to get the deal if nobody knows who you are. And so she basically did everything you talked about. She did writing. She started a podcast in which she invited influential people on. She contributed to a book. She helped people out.

(00:19:55):
She did networking dinners. She did everything she could so that people would recognize and know Laura Chau. And one of the things she did was she's tall. In general, Asian women are not tall. She decided to play up the fact that she was, in the words of some people, the tallest Asian woman they'd ever seen. She wears heels. In her heels she's six feet one inches tall. She also, when she comes to my class, many people come to my class with hoodies, God knows what. She has style and it's a unique style. So she thinks about very strategically, how am I going to dress? How am I going to look? How am I going to show up? How am I going to do what I need to do so that people know who I am? Obviously there's substance. If you have visibility without substance, people will know you're useless. But if you have substance without visibility, no one will know the substance that you got.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:56):
You also talk about how you can reframe this idea of not being self-promotional, but it's amplifying the impact of the team that I work with, or it's me scaling myself by sharing things I know and pointing people to it.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:11):
Absolutely, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):
Awesome. Okay, let's move on to a different power. Let's talk about power one, which is getting out of your own way. Talk about what that means and how someone can work on that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:21:20):
Well, you already have done a fabulous job of illustrating principle one by talking about how this is the topic that makes people uncomfortable. And when something makes people uncomfortable, in general, they're going to shy away from it. So if I think power is dirty, if I think power is evil, if I think power is something I want nothing to do with, the first thing that's going to happen is I'm not going to do what I need to do to be successful in my career. So that is one way in which we get in our own way. Another way in which we get in our own way, many people suffer from what is called in the psychology literature, imposter syndrome. They believe that they were the admissions mistake at Stanford. They were the hiring mistake in whatever company they're working for. That somehow they got to this job, but they don't really deserve to be there because they're surrounded by people who are smarter and better than them, and therefore they will do things.

(00:22:18):
I can't even believe that this goes on. So I will have students, not many, but a few. Now raise their hand, I'll call them, and the first things out of their mouth will be, I don't know if this comment is going to be useful. This is called pre-emptory apology. If the comment is not going to be useful, don't say it. That's number one, but number two, don't apologize. Pardon me for interrupting. Pardon me for taking up your time. Stop all this apologizing. If you got the job you're in, you probably are not only qualified, you're probably overqualified. So don't use descriptors of yourself that disempower you. Don't think of yourself as not deserving of the job that you hold, because that attitude will leak out and other people will say, if Lenny doesn't think he deserved the job, then maybe I shouldn't think he deserves the job either.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:19):
So basically the first power is you're shooting yourself in the foot by worrying too much about whether people like you. This friend of mine who's now the founder that I read some quotes from, she said her number one takeaway from your class is if you want to be liked, get a dog.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:23:32):
That's correct. That is a quote from my dear friend Gary Loveman, who for many years ran Harrah's, which then became Caesars, the casino company.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):
You also talk about this. Yeah, there's this quote I have. "Acknowledge that others are often no better than you, because that makes you feel better about the story." So for people that actually want to be liked, I like being liked. I don't know if it's a flaw in my upbringing. Is the lesson you're capped on your power if you worry about if you want to be liked?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:24:05):
At the end of the day, you don't want to be intentionally disliked. You don't want to violate my dear friend Bob Sutton's book The No Asshole Rule and gratuitously be an asshole. But you are hired to get a job done. It's interesting. I unfortunately am now too old. In the words of my chiropractor, I'm suffering from too many birthdays. So I have a lot of doctors who are doing a great job. Trust me, when I choose a doctor, I have a, unfortunately he retired, a neurosurgeon who did two surgeries on my spine. He's considered to be one of the top 20 in the country. If you go on Yelp, you read about his personality and his office furniture. As I said to somebody, he's doing microsurgery on my spine, I can wind up permanently paralyzed. I really don't care about his personality. I don't care about his office furniture.

(00:25:01):
That's an extreme example, but it makes the point. When you are put in a role, you are put in a role because presumably you are supposed to perform in that role. If you get appointed to be a head coach, if we make you a quarterback on an NFL team, or we make you center on a National Basketball Association team, you did not get that job because people thought you had a cute personality. You got that job because you have the skills to make your organization successful. And if you do not use those skills because you're worried about what everybody else is thinking, you are not only harming yourself, but you're harming them because you are not doing what you were hired to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:46):
So a simple way of thinking about this, which makes me feel better about. As we talk through this, I'm becoming less uncomfortable with these, which is a good sign. It's don't actively try to be disliked. Don't prioritize being liked, prioritize competence and respect.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:25:59):
Correct, absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
And doing the thing that needs to be done.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:03):
Absolutely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:04):
Okay, great. Let's talk about rule number two, which is break the rules. So basically again, these powers are ways to grow power, and you're saying that if you break the rules, you get more power. Talk about why that's the case, what that looks like.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:26:18):
Well, for many reasons, number one, when you break the rules, you stand out. You become memorable when you do something that's unexpected. And being memorable is of course important, as we've already discussed. That's number one. Number two, the rules were made mostly by the people who are favored by the rules in place. So if we were talking about business strategy, we would talk about a word that is probably now overused. We would talk about being a disruptor. That you would disrupt an industry. And how do you disrupt an industry? By doing something that is different from the other industry incumbents. In Southwest Airlines, you don't do hub and spoke. At Amazon, you provide an incredible level of customer service. Whole Foods, you don't optimize on the cost of the stuff in your store, but you optimize on fitting local taste, whatever. You would be a disruptor, you would do things that are different.

(00:27:14):
The same principle holds for you, that if you are going to be successful, you have to do what number one, plays to your strengths, to use the title of a Gallup book. Number two, you have to do things again that cause you to stand out, and you have to do things that basically will make you more successful. One of the conventional wisdoms that people I think adhere to way too much, is don't ask. Don't ask, don't ask for help. You need to show self-sufficiency. So my colleague, Frances Flynn, Frank Flynn, wrote an article with Vanessa Lake entitled, If You Need Help, Just Ask. And it turns out people overestimate how many people they're going to have to ask to get help, and it turns out that asking for help makes people uncomfortable.

(00:28:03):
I was married, if you read the acknowledgments in Seven Rules of Power. For more than 35 years I was married to Kathleen Francis Fowler, who I could send you a picture. She looked literally like a supermodel and I never have been any particularly better looking than I am now. So somebody said to me, how'd you get her to go out with you? And the answer of course is, I asked. I asked, I asked, I asked. No one, well, maybe not no one. But few people are going to go out with you if you don't ask them out. Few people are going to marry you if you don't ask them to marry. Few people are going to do anything if you don't ask. And what is the worst that could happen? If you ask and they say, no, you are no worse off than had you not asked in the first place. If you don't ask, you're not going to get it. If you ask and they say, no, you're not going to get it. Get over your ego, ask.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:59):
Is there another example that comes to mind of someone breaking the rules say in business, that ended up being really successful as a result, or just someone that is really good at this in business?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:07):
I can give you many examples. One of my favorite examples would be Jason Calacanis. I don't know if you know Jason.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):
Oh yeah, I know you did a case study on him. I know him well. Yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:18):
So I think Jason, I think consistently breaks all kinds of rules. First of all, when he comes to my class, nobody likes him, but that's okay. Almost nobody likes him. But...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:30):
That's power number one. He's not worried about.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:29:33):
Yeah, that's number one. But also I think there's a conventional wisdom in the venture capital industry which he defies almost completely. He makes a lot of little bets, not a few big bets. He runs a very lean operation. He doesn't have a lot of partners. He doesn't have actually any partners, so he can't be fired by his partners. He began his career in journalism, which is interesting. Being a journalist is a wonderful job because you get to ask people all kinds of questions. And if you ask smart people questions, and you have some reasonable level of intelligence yourself, at the end of that process, you're going to wind up incredibly smart and incredibly insightful. And he wound up incredibly smart and insightful around aspects of the internet industry.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:23):
And he definitely has a lot of power. I think I am going to link to the case study in our show notes where you basically walk through how he went from nothing to a very powerful person.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:31):
And by the way, a very rich person as well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:34):
Let's talk about another power, power five, networking relentlessly. What does that look like and how do you get better at this?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:30:42):
Well, I think there's research that shows that many people find networking dirty, and that's because I think they think about it in the wrong way. My friend John Levy, who has written a fabulous book, You're Invited. Which is a book about how to put on events that people want to come to. Is a fabulous human being. Will tell you that the first principle of networking is in fact generosity. It's generosity. What can I do for you? How can I be helpful? Who can I introduce you to? Either a company or a product or a person who can be helpful to you in your career.

(00:31:20):
But in order to be able to introduce you to someone who's going to be useful to you, I have to know people. If I don't know anybody, I can't introduce you to anybody. And the more people I know, the more likely it will be that if you say, I need to know somebody in X, I will know that person. So the broader your social network, the more people and the more things you will know. If knowledge is power, networking is a fabulous way to get knowledge about people and about ideas.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):
It's funny to hear this where it's like, yes, obviously this is right, but connecting it to if you want to become more powerful, more successful, you need to do this. I think that is a powerful point that we're all making here, is just like this actually is necessary if you want to acquire more power.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:32:10):
Of course. I have a funny story about networking. So we have a thing in Stanford called View From The Top, in which these fancy people come in and give a talk. And one of the people came in and give a talk and made my class instantly popular, because he's an extraordinarily wealthy person. His name is Omid Kordestani, and so I reached out to him and I said, "Omid, let's have breakfast." So I can understand because during the thing, when somebody asked them what class was the most important in his success, he said mine. So I said, "Tell me your story." He said, "Well, I graduated from Stanford. I'm Persian in background, immigrant background. An engineer, HP, all the things that would make you kind of a nerd or something." He said, "I went to work for a couple of startups that didn't do well. Then I found myself in the mid-nineties at Netscape." The browser company, big deal. Anyway, Marc Andreessen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:07):
Oh yeah.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:33:08):
Okay. "So I found myself in Netscape in marketing and business development. I was not making any progress. One day I decided to take your class to an extreme. I decided to stop doing my job." So I said, "When people gave you projects to do or assignments or tasks and you didn't do them?" He said, "It turns out that I spent my time, not obviously at the bar, but in networking first with people inside of Netscape. And it turns out if you're well-connected to the senior leaders, they don't really care if you do your job or not. That's number one. Number two," he said, "oftentimes I can find other people to do the work I was doing. So instead of basically spending time doing my job, I networked first within Netscape." But Netscape was not that big of a company. So after a while he decided to go through, which is by the way, his job anyway, in marketing and business, he decided to basically drive through the Silicon Valley talking to people. And this is the rest of the browsers are just beginning.

(00:34:14):
Nobody knows what a browser is, nobody knows what the internet is going to become. So he's having all these fabulous conversations. All right, so he now knows basically everybody. It's 1998 and a little tiny company decides 10 engineers, typical Silicon Valley company. 10 engineers, all engineers. I have a friend who went to work for a company, run a company that had 26 people. He didn't have one sales and marketing person. Anyway, the company now has 10 engineers. They decide they need to hire their first business person. Being an analytically oriented company, they say, we're going to do this very analytically. We are basically going to ask everybody we can think of, and a few people we can't. Give us a list of the best technically oriented business people that you know. And there is of course one name that appears on every list. It is Omid Kordestani who becomes employee number 11 at Google and makes two and a half billion dollars.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:13):
Great success from networking. Well done. When people hear about networking, it just feels like you said, very cringe. I don't want to go to these networking events and try to pretend to talk and care about people. Do you have any advice for just how to make networking feel less cringy?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:35:28):
One of the exercises I give my students is I say, write a list of 10 people who, if you knew them and if they knew you, would be important for whatever you're trying to accomplish in your career. So maybe you're trying to get into biotech, you need to know 10 executives in biotech or whatever. Make a list of 10 people. Then for each person figure out how you are going to meet them. By the way, not necessarily in a network event. Maybe you want to do what John Levy does, which is hold dinners. In which by the way, the guests do the cooking, which is a very interesting idea. That of course taps into the IKEA effect. You always like something better if you participate in creating it. Maybe you want to hold dinners, maybe you want to try to reach out to them at lunch.

(00:36:21):
Maybe you want to reach out to them and say, here's an article I think you'd be interested in. Here is somebody who I think you'd benefit from meeting. So recently, I'm not a particularly good networker, though I'm better I guess than some people. I recently met Esther Wojcicki, I'm sure I killed her name. She's considered the grandmother of Silicon Valley. She's Susan Wojcicki's mother. And she is interested in depression, particularly depression among teenagers. And I said, you should know Leanne Williams, who's in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Science Department, who has done probably 300 articles on depression and has invented something which is called Precision Psychiatry. So I connected them to each other. Just send an email. I think you ought to know each other. They got together. I get credit for knowing people and connecting them, but I also benefit them. Leanne needs to raise money. Esther's got money. Esther needs to understand the cutting edge research in depression and biomarkers of depression, which is what Leanne's specialty is, so they benefit. So this is not some icky thing. This is connecting people who benefit from being connected.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):
That touches on something you teach in the book is, in your networking you want to become a broker, you want to be central. That's kind of what you want to work on. Can you talk a bit about what that means?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:37:47):
Well, that means you want to connect people. So many people with benefits, and many groups with benefits for being connected, and they're not connected. What does a venture capitalist do? Connects people with ideas to people with money, and takes a fee for doing it. What does an investment banker do? Connects people trying to sell businesses or raise capital with people trying to buy businesses or who have capital. What's a real estate agent do? Connects buyers and sellers of houses. There are all kinds of examples where the person's entire job is connecting people. But even for the people whose job it isn't, you benefit from knowing people. The more people you know, the more things you know. As I sometimes say in my class, if leadership management, call it what you will, is getting things done through other people, it seems like common sense that the more other people you know, the more you'll be able to get done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):
As someone that has become central to a lot of things in the product world, and has built a large network as a result of this podcast newsletter, I can tell you a thousand percent. This creates a lot of opportunity and power, you could say in quotes. So I've seen it happen.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:39:00):
Of course.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):

(00:40:10):
Another lesson I guess you teach is to pursue weak ties. Talk a bit about what that means. What do you mean by that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:40:14):
Well, the people to whom you are strongly tied, your family, your spouse, significant other, your friends, the people who work with you at work will probably, because they are close to you, know the same things and the same people that you do. So to the extent that you build ties with people who are more different from you in every dimension, you are more likely to learn non-redundant information, and come in contact with people that you don't already know. This again seems common sense. There's a lot of research behind it. Mark Granovetter, a sociologist who still teaches at Stanford, wrote a book entitled The Strength of Weak Ties.

(00:40:59):
And basically, no, actually, pardon me. He wrote an article called The Strength of Weak Ties. His book was called Getting a Job. And he did a study, I guess it was at that time in Boston. He did a study of job seekers in Massachusetts, and he looked at people who got jobs through applying to ads, through more formal means. And then he looked at people who got jobs through referrals from their network. And it turns out, of course, the jobs that you get through your network referrals are much better jobs. And oftentimes the best jobs that people got were referred to them by people that were not particularly close to them. Because they had a view, that's the word I was looking for, a view into the ecosystem of the Boston labor market, that the other people didn't have because they weren't in the same place as the other people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):
I love that lesson. Let's talk about another power, which is using your power. So when people think of using your power builds more power, that's not intuitive. You talk about how it creates this self-perpetuating growth of power the more you practice power. Can you talk a bit about that?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:42:16):
Sure. So when you are given, it's interesting, my friend Deborah Gruenfeld, who wrote a book called Acting with Power, talks a lot about people's ambivalence to power. So sometimes people are put in a job. Herminia Ibarra who teaches now at London Business School, at one point taught in Seattle, at one point taught at Harvard, has an article in the Harvard Business Review in which she talks about a woman in a drug company who gets a promotion, and says to her colleagues, to whom she's now overseeing, that she's not sure why she got the job. She's not sure she deserves the job. Needless to say, she didn't do very well in this job because she got in her own way. But part of this is you are put in a position of power. You're put in a position of authority in order to make things happen. So to the extent you mobilize your resources and get things to happen, you'll get more resources.

(00:43:14):
People want to be associated with success. To the extent that you become successful, more people will want to work with you. To the extent that you get more stuff done, you'll get more promotions, more opportunities. Nobody's going to give you a job to do if the last five jobs like that they gave you, you couldn't get done. So the more you are able to do, which oftentimes of course requires power and influence, the more you're able to do, the more you'll be asked to do. But better yet, the more resources you'll be given to help you get things done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:48):
And I think there's interestingly you teach that just showing that you have power creates more power. People see that you have this power and they start to follow your lead more, right? That's a part of this.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:43:57):
Yep. I just saw over the weekend the movie, the latest movie in the franchise of the Planet of the Apes. When Jim Collins left Stanford, he gave me a book called Chimpanzee Politics, which is of course not based on the Planet of the Apes, but it's based upon the study of chimpanzees. We are the same. People are attracted to power, you know that. By the way, that will account for a lot of what is going to happen in the presidential election.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):
Let's save that for the end, because I think that's an interesting piece of your book, of the connection to Trump. So let's save that for a bit. I think that'll be really interesting. Kind of along the same lines of the area we're just talking about. And another rule of power is to show up in a powerful fashion. So look powerful, talk about what that looks like.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:44:43):
So my colleague at Berkeley, Dana Carney, C-A-R-N-E-Y, is writing a book called Tell, which is about the importance of body language and how to master body language. There is some evidence that suggests we respond mostly to how people look, secondarily to how they sound, and by far the least important to the content of what they say. You can see this by turning on your TV and turning off the sound. Watch the presidential debates with the sound off. They'll be much better. I have another colleague in marketing by the name of Baba Shiv, who talks about people's freaky mind, or the idea that we are in fact descended from primates, and that we are controlled in lots of ways by our emotions. And so we respond affectively to other people. We respond to how they look. There's evidence in economics that suggests tall people earn more salaries, control, earn more money, controlling for lots of things, attractive people.

(00:45:46):
As long as you're not too attractive, you earn more money. Optimal level of attractiveness because people respond subconsciously to how people look, how they sound, how they show up, how they present themselves. In my class, I take the example of Tony Hayward of BP, the Macondo oil spill, and Lloyd Blankfein who was accused of shorting the securities that he was selling, which by the way, Goldman did. And before I let them hear Tony or Lloyd, we show about 60 seconds. And Lloyd's case 34 seconds with no sound. And even if you did not know who these people were and I asked you to make a bet, who's going to keep their job and who's going to lose it? You would know just from their physical appearance.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):
I love that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:46:39):
And by the way, what Dana Carney will tell you, and what common sense will tell you, is that these are skills that can be mastered. Robert de Niro was not born Robert de Niro, in the sense of acting skills are learned. How you show up, how you command the room. There's a guy named Regis McKenna who is older than God, who's famous for running a very, very, very fancy public relations firm in the Silicon Valley. And his biggest contribution to life, as well as by the way to his personal wealth, is that he made Steve Jobs Steve Jobs. When Steve Jobs began, Steve Jobs couldn't convince you to buy water if you were dying of thirst. He could not give a presentation to save his life. And Regis McKenna and his team took Steve Jobs under their wing and created Steve Jobs, a man who could sell anything to anybody. These are skills. This is not about personality. This is not about undergoing some kind of cosmetic surgery or whatever. These are skills, everything we've talked about, networking, showing up, all these things. These are skills that can be learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:55):
I have a list of some of the stuff you actually recommend for looking and appearing powerful. So I'll read a few and I'm curious what else comes to mind. So do not read from notes. Make eye contact. Keep it brief. You say that anger can be a signal of power because it's outside the norm. It's kind of breaking the rules. Don't apologize. It's kind of the opposite. More gestures, which is interesting. Open body posture. Louder voice. Okay, I'm going to speak louder now. I like this. Okay, what else comes to mind as ways to appear powerful?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:48:26):
Invading people's personal space. So gentle touching, standing close to someone. We're not talking about sexual touching, we're talking touch on the arm or the shoulder, shaking people's hands. That's a way of I think being more powerful. But you've covered the main ones. Eye contact. One of the problems with Tony Hayward of BP is that he's been given a statement to read. You cannot read something in front of you and make eye contact at the same time. So he looks like he's scripted. He looks like he's insincere. Jack Valenti, who I had the privilege of knowing, who for 38 years was the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, and typically rated one of the number one or number two most effective lobbyists in Washington DC, said to my class when he came to my class, which he did, "I never appeared before Congress with notes. I wanted them to believe, which was by the way, true, that I was in complete control and complete mastery of the material, and that I did not need notes or a bunch of assistants around me to help me.

(00:49:40):
That I, as the head of the MPAA, understood the motion picture industry." And then he would give you a little aside about how it was the one industry that consistently had a budget surplus in trade. He would talk about how many jobs he created and he had all this stuff at his fingertips. But basically his command of the material made him more powerful. It's interesting, Jack Valenti was five foot two inches tall and he came, talked to my class, and the next class I said to people, "What are your reactions? What are your thoughts?" And a woman raised her hand and said, "He feels taller than he is." And I thought that was an assessment that was both true and insightful. When the five-foot-two Jack Valenti appeared, because of his presence, because of his body language, because of his Texas drawl, because of how he moved on the stage, he felt bigger. You would not say he did not feel five-foot-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):
Let me read a couple more because this is a good example of stuff he did. Other ways to appear more powerful is more speaking time, longer gazing time, more disinhibited laughs. Is that just you laughing and feeling like you're just...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:08):
Well, humor. Humor. The famous author, Salman Rushdie said, and I quote Salman Rushdie, it's a fabulous quote. "If you can get people to laugh, you can tell them anything."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):
Yeah, stand-up comedy is a great example that. So again, I think here people might be hearing this and they're like, I don't want to be this person. I don't want to be talking all the time. I don't want to be pretending like open posture. Is the advice here just you don't need to do all these things. Just know this makes people more powerful. Don't necessarily judge people, do some of these things maybe because it'll add to your power? How do you think about just people that are turned off by this sort of thing?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:51:45):
That's a wonderful question. So I say to my class, on the very first day of class, that we will go through four stages. We'll go through the stage of denial. It doesn't work in my culture, it doesn't work in my organization, doesn't work for me, it doesn't work in my religion, whatever. Then we'll go through anger. When they get angry at me, how can you teach us this stuff? Then they'll go into sadness. I actually believe this and I'm depressed. And if we're successful, they will go through acceptance. And the process I have, again, I do not have the most popular class at Stanford Business School because I am good-looking, because I'm the smartest person at Stanford or anything else. I am strategic about thinking about if I have someone who's going to come into this class, I have to get them from denial to acceptance in 10 weeks.

(00:52:38):
And how are we going to do that? The easiest way to do that, if I said, Lenny, I want you to become a better tennis player, or a better roller blader, or a better ice skater, whatever, a better piano player in 10 weeks, what would we do? If we have practice and coaching. And that's what I do in the class, practice and coaching. I have executive coaches who work with the class and I give them assignments that ask them to practice what they're learning. And therefore, by the end of the class, most people have made this transition because it is true. If you've never... I had a dinner the other night, this Israeli woman who's like, I've done amazing stuff. Amazing. Which is fabulous. And she said at the dinner, she said, "I would've never done this before taking your class." And the way you get them to do this is I don't say, Lenny, you're going to swim the English Channel tomorrow.

(00:53:38):
If I want you to swim the English Channel, we're going to start by swimming in pools and make every day a little bit more challenging. That's what we do. I don't start by saying, you're going to network like Keith Ferrazzi or John Levy, or you're not going to be as bold as Jason Calacanis, who trust me is extraordinarily bold. You're not going to necessarily do what I did. You're going to begin where you can begin, and push yourself out of your comfort zone. Because, and again, this is common sense.

(00:54:13):
There's also a ton of research behind it. If you always stay in your comfort zone, you'll never do anything different or better than what you're currently doing. This is true. If I said to you, I want you to, at the end of 10 weeks, lift a hundred pounds, I can't do that by on the last day saying lift a hundred pounds. We have to work up to it. And that is, it's the same principle here. So don't do something that looks so off the wall or so out of character for you that you can't conceive doing it. Push yourself a little, push yourself a little.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):
There's an interesting connection here too. What some say is kind of the opposite of your class at Stanford, which is Touchy-Feely. We had Carole Robin on the podcast and she has a framework, the 15% rule where you push yourself 15% beyond your comfort zone. Where it's just a little bit, but it's not too far, and it feels like you try to do a similar thing.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:07):
Yeah, absolutely. So you begin by doing what you don't think you can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Let's spend a little more time here around the homework assignments, and this kind of Knowing-Doing Gap that you talked about. So you shared a couple of homework assignments you give already, find 10 people, think of 10 people you want to meet that'll help you with your career and then try to meet them. And then there's this, I guess my friend started a podcast, I don't know which homework it was. What other homework assignments do you give?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:55:30):
So we begin, there's a literature on goal setting that says if you set goals, you're more likely to achieve them. This is, again, not some huge insight, but there's an enormous scientific literature about this. And so I begin the very first homework assignment is, which is by the way, on the very first day of class, why are you here? Why are you here? It is now the end of this class. What would success look like to you? What would you like to accomplish in our 10 weeks together? Second assignment, I give them a reading from the Power book, which is the book before Seven Rules, which talks about the seven attributes of power. Go out and get people to rate you on these or rate yourself. Set for yourself a development plan, energy, focus, being willing to tolerate conflict, all these qualities. What are you strong on? What are you weak on? What do you want to build during our time together, and how are you going to do it?

(00:56:35):
So we begin with goal setting. One of the assignments I give them, which is the class that Jason comes to, what resources can you create? You're at Stanford Business School, elite, fancy Stanford. What can you do in your 10 weeks here? I have people who created awards. A woman who created an award gave it to Karlie Kloss, the model. Got in trouble with the school. It turns out it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission. So what can you do to create resources that will give you some leverage? That would be a third assignment. The networking is a fourth assignment. The acting with power. I show them the videos and I tell them in advance of the class, and I tell them they need to become Tony Hayward. They need to do a better job, which is, by the way, a low bar, representing BP. And give me a 60 to 90 second video and then share it with colleagues and get feedback on it. And then we're going to call on people in the class.

(00:57:47):
In other words, for every idea, I try to think of something. And this is all, by the way, this is all front-loaded. And by the end of the class we're not doing this so much. But I try to give them an exercise that causes them to actually take that idea and implement it. Find people, oh, for branding. Write a personal brand statement, get some feedback on it, then write it again. How do you want to be known? Which is by the way, useful to you because you're a second-year MBA, you're going to go in the job market. What do you want people to think about you? How do you want people to respond to you? How do you want to be known? So I basically take for every topic and have them do it. And then the coach, their person, their coach, who is responsible for 23 of these people, give them feedback on this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:44):
I could see how this makes a big impact on someone's life.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:58:49):
Yeah. And so at the end, I had a student a couple years ago said to me, "It is not that I got more feedback and more useful feedback from your class than I did in any other class. I got more useful feedback in your class than I did on every other class I took combined."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:09):
I can see why. Let's talk about the last power. So we've talked through six already. We have only one more to go, which is maybe the one that probably upsets people most, which is that once you have power, people will forget what you did to get there. Talk about what that looks like and is that a power or is it more just like this is what you should know about.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (00:59:28):
And I put in rule seven for the following reason. In spite of everything that you and I have been talking about, many people in a stage of, I don't know, denial or something, say, I'm worried that if I do this, at the end... People believe that the world is homeostatic. It is not. That it's going to adjust, but whatever. At the end I will be brought low. They have the myth of Icarus in their head. You fly too close to the sun, your wings are going to melt, you're going to be brought down. And so I try to convince them, partly through a lecture and partly through rule seven. And some of the principles that I talk about in rule seven. That, in fact, life is not homeostatic at all. That life is actually self-fulfilling. If I believe you're powerful, you will become more powerful.

(01:00:26):
If I believe you have no power, you will wind up with almost no power, and that therefore it is all forgotten and forgiven. And I begin, I believe I begin. But if not, I could begin with the story of the South Carolina Senator who says nasty things about Trump, and then Lindsey Graham, and becomes Trump's biggest acolyte. And the New York Times, of course, is fascinated by this. How can you say all these horrible things about Trump and now be his, basically have your lips affixed to some part of his anatomy? And Lindsey's answer is, I want to be relevant. He's the President of the United States. This goes back to the judgment. I like him, this, that, the other thing. He's the president. If I want to get legislation passed, he, by the way, has taken over the Republican Party.

(01:01:22):
If I want to get stuff done, I need to have him on my side. And like many narcissists and egomaniacs, it is not a good way to get them on your side by saying nasty things about them. So this is the pragmatics. People forget that Bill Gates stole the code on which Microsoft has built. People forget that Jeffrey Epstein, after being convicted of sex offenses, was still having dinners with members of the royal family and members of the New York media elite. People forget that Martha Stewart, who served time in jail, has a brand that's never been more valuable. People forget all this stuff.

(01:02:19):
I still remember sitting in the office of someone whose name I won't use, but I'll use enough that if somebody wanted to search it out, you could. So I am sitting in this guy's office and he's, by the way, a Jewish man. He's got pictures of him with the Pope, he's got pictures of him with Ronald Reagan. He's got pictures with him, with all these people. What is his secret? He, by the way, took a company into bankruptcy. People lost literally billions of dollars. He was fined. He lost money, but he walked away with about $700 million. It turns out, $700 million makes you a big deal. Lives at the biggest house in Los Angeles or one of the biggest houses in Los Angeles. I can't keep up with the construction of the big houses. People want to be close to money, power, and success, and they will overlook your flaws to be close to you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):
And again, you talk about this in the book. You're not describing how the world should work. This is just how it is, and this is how you can be successful in the world that we live in.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:03:28):
And by the way, this is how the world not only is, but how it was and how it will be. Because these ideas are not something that I sat down one day and made up or something. These ideas, everything that I talk about, including this last one, has social science and logic behind it. So you can explain not only what is, but why it is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):
So, let's talk about Trump for a bit. At the beginning of your book, you say that basically you were going to write a book about why Trump is so successful and what he's done so well. And your realization is no one's going to pay attention if here's how to be like Trump. And essentially, if you think about all these rules, it's clear he is very good at all of these things.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:16):
That's correct. By the way, not because he read the book, but because he does it through trial and error or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):
So when people hear that, they're like, I don't want to be Trump. I don't like how Trump is. I don't want to be seen that way. Do you have any thoughts on just how to make people feel comfortable following some of these powers and building power, knowing that, oh wow, maybe he's the epitome of some of this stuff?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:04:38):
I will tell you a story. In 1993, a woman named Laura Esserman, who's a doctor, took my class. She claims publicly that this is the only class at Stanford for which she did all the reading. By the way, while she was getting her MBA at Stanford, she was having her first child and practicing medicine full time. Laura Esserman said to me one day, "You have a case. You have cases on all these people doing evil things. Why don't you ever write a case about somebody doing good things?" And of course, I wrote a case about her. So she comes to the class. Case was published in probably 2003, 2004.

(01:05:31):
She comes to the class and the students are, what is the right word? Hard on her? That would be a modest thing. The students eviscerate her because she is incredibly smart, incredibly well-intentioned, but she will not network. She says, "I don't have time for schmoozing." She will not do almost any of the stuff that we talk about today. So she and her husband, Michael Endicott, two of my closest friends in the world, and I go out to lunch afterwards. And smoke is coming out of her ears and she is pissed off. And this is a very accomplished woman and a very smart woman. And she's pissed. I said to her, "Laura, you have boundless energy and boundless intelligence. You're a force of nature. Let me discuss something from the past subject of physics.

(01:06:39):
You are creating friction. With enough force you can overcome the friction. If you reduce the friction, just think how much more you could accomplish." And she looked at me and changed. And I will tell you, and I've said this publicly, because I get to introduce her for all the awards she's won, and she's now won a ton of them. Including Time Magazine 2016 list of a hundred most influential people in the world. And I say to people, and I say it with pride, that of all the things I've done in my life, the thing I'm most proud of and most proud of is creating Laura Esserman.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:20):
That is an awesome story and a really good way of thinking about this from a different angle.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:07:24):
Yeah, no, and I said to Laura, I said, "You want to make profound changes in the drug development process. You want to make profound changes in whether or not we learn from the treatments that are being given to people. You want to make profound changes in the connection between research and teaching, research and practice. You want to do all these things. If you are going to accomplish any of these things, you need to cross the bridge." And she hasn't crossed the bridge completely and she and I joke about it. But she crossed the bridge a lot and she has accomplished incredible things. She's won every cancer award that can be given. And by the way, she's won all these awards for the American Cancer Society, who she fought with. She's won these awards from the Susan Cohen Foundation, who she fought with.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:20):
This is an incredible example of the opening quote to your book that I have here. "If you want power to be used for good, more good people need to have power."

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:28):
That's exactly right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:30):
And I like the, it's like a quote attributed to me, is how you...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:08:34):
Yeah. Well, I don't remember saying it, but somebody said, I said it. I'll take credit for it. I said to Laura, "You want to change medicine? Medicine is not going to change without the application of power and influence." If change was going to happen, it would've happened already. You have to take on entrenched interests. She has a whole thing, which we need not go into because it's pretty technical, on screening. She said, everybody's getting a mammogram every year beyond a certain age, which is stupid for a variety of reasons. You can read, she was on the PBS NewsHour about this. This is what got her in trouble with the radiologists. The radiologists, of course, are selling screening. She said, there's some people that need to be screened every month, and there's some people that need to be screened never because of their genetics. She wants custom tailored screening or precision screening. Anyway, she fights everybody.

(01:09:29):
Richard Blum, Dianne Feinstein's husband, both Dianne and Richard Blum are now deceased, was at a thing where she launched the Athena Project. The Athena Project, she's now, with her collaborators, collecting data on the diagnosis and treatment and outcome for 150,000 patients in the University of California Healthcare System. So I'm supposed to give some opening talk to provide entertainment. And Dick Blum is there. Dick Blum, of course is wealthy. He's Dianne Feinstein's husband. I said to him, "Dick, how did Laura get you here?" And I still remember, I think this is a quote in one of the books I wrote. He said to me, he said, "Look." He said, "I've learned that at the end of the day when Laura asks you to do something, you may say no, but at the end of the day, you're going to do it anyway. Save yourself the aggravation."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):
Oh man, I feel like you're just endlessly full of good stories that we could just keep going on and on. Let me try to summarize the rules of power real quick and see if anything else emerges. And then have just a couple more questions. So the Seven Rules of Power, get out of your own way, break the rules, show up in a powerful fashion, create a powerful brand, network relentlessly, use your power, and understand that once you've acquired power, that what you did to get there will be forgiven, forgotten, or both. Let me ask you a question, maybe half in jest. You teach people how to acquire power. Why aren't you the most powerful man in the world?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:10:57):
Ah, that's a very good question. To which I have a very good answer. I have a colleague who's unfortunately now deceased, by the name of James G. March, who was a very, very distinguished scholar. And James March said to me many, many years ago, something which is completely true. You can have power or you can have autonomy, but you cannot have both. And I have chosen to live a life of freedom, autonomy. I could tell you stories that would bring tears to your eyes. I'll tell you one. We had a dean of the Business School whose wife was dying of cancer, and she was projected to die in the fall. So the Business School goes to him and says, we'll give you the fall off to be with your wife. She lives until June. It's now winter.

(01:11:46):
You have responsibilities as the Dean of the Business School. You have to meet with alumni. You have to go around and raise money. You have to show up at events, university events. I do not necessarily think that is how he wanted to spend the winter and spring quarters, but that's what you have to do. When I wanted Jack Valenti to come to my class, I did not call Jack Valenti. I called Judy Dickey. Judy Dickey was his assistant. Judy Dickey controlled his schedule. I meet Jack on such and such a day. He can't make it on that day. Fine. I can adjust the schedule. Can he make it on this day?

(01:12:24):
When I wanted my friend Gary Loveman, who ran Harrah's and Caesars and then was the number two executive at Aetna, I want him to come to my class. I called Reggie Kirk. I didn't call Gary Loveman. And that's all you need to know. I do not have an assistant who controls my schedule. I control my schedule. You will not find my Outlook calendar on any website, on any computer. I want autonomy. If I said to you, "Lenny, I will give you $1 billion, or for that matter, $10 billion if you can buy-"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):
Yes.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:13:02):
Wait, if you can have last week again. You can't. You can't. Time goes in only one direction. I want control of my time. It is much more important to me, being a Dean or an Associate Dean, a job that I was asked to do. I took one academic administrative job. I'm actually memorialized, believe it or not, in the Stanford Record, as having led, and this is according to my expenses, the Nobel Prize winner who was Dean at the time, that I led the biggest and most successful transformation in the history of higher education. I did it. I did it once. I didn't like it. Life is too short. I want to do what I like.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:52):
That's a really profound point that I think people don't think about, is there's always this drive to acquire power. And your point is that there's a big downside, which is a lack of autonomy. Yeah. You think about the, as I was trying to get Satya Nadella on the podcast, and I talked to his comms people, and they're like, every hour for the next three months is booked already. We know what he's doing. He's extremely booked. And you think about the president, obviously at Elon. I totally get what you're saying.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:14:17):
It is true, and I don't want to do that. And by the way, power also comes with enormous visibility. Donald Trump has done, for 40 years, what he's now being accused of doing, the tax stuff, all this stuff. He's been a grifter all his life. But when you become President, people are going to look at things that in the past they would not have looked at. You become president of a university, you're going to have scrutiny as the President of Harvard Law and the President of Stanford Law, when they both had to resign, in one case because of plagiarism, in another case because of research misconduct.

(01:14:55):
Power comes. You're going to be put under a microscope. People are going to look at what car you drive. They're going to look at who you go out with. They're going to look at how you spend your time. They're going to look at how you associate with, you'll have no privacy. You'll have very little control over your life. Everybody will feel completely free to dissect you in public, in private, whatever. And you'll face the trust dilemma. When you are rich and powerful the question will be, are people praising you, are people associating with you because of you or because of the position you hold?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:41):
Yeah. Do you spend any time, just to follow this thread in your class, convincing people stop being so obsessed with power, stop being so obsessed with becoming the top of everything? Is that a part of the class?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:52):
No.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:52):
Or is it just...

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:15:53):
No. I teach them, they see we have a class on the price of power. I bring out Rudy Crew. Rudy Crew was the New York School's Chancellor under Rudy Giuliani. By the way, he tells many interesting stories about Rudy Giuliani, who did not just become the joke that he is overnight. He's worked hard to become that. But in any event, he tells. And one year, one year, because his daughter at that time was living in the Bay Area, when I asked him about the effect of the positions he held, Head of Miami Dade County Schools, Head of New York City schools.

(01:16:29):
Had Hillary ever won, he would've been Secretary of Education. Literally. There's Lauren in the room. And he said to the class, Jeffrey asked me the question, "Why don't we let Lauren answer it?" By the time she was finished, there was not a dry eye in the room. What is it like to be the child? What is it like to be the significant other of these people? And you know the answer to that because you can see the suicides, the divorce rates. There is a price that not only you pay, but a price that your family pays.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):
I think that's a really good balance to the entire conversation. Maybe just as a last question, what if we give the audience a homework assignment to work on these power rules? What's something that you'd recommend someone try to do? I know it's probably dependent on what they're good at, not good at. What's something that they could do to start moving towards one of these rules?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:17:28):
So what I would say, and it comes from something that you talked about in our conversation at several times, which is this is uncomfortable. Okay. So if I want you to do something uncomfortable, I could say, "Lenny, go do this uncomfortable thing on your own." Or I can say, "Lenny, I want you to do this with help, with social support." And so the first thing I would say to someone is, if you think this is uncomfortable, or if you think you're not skilled at this, get coaching. Get a coach.

(01:18:03):
I send out regularly the list of the coaches who work with my online and on-campus classes. Happy to do it. And they're happy to have the business. Get a coach. Get a personal board of directors like they talk about in the Wall Street Journal. In other words, get people who will give you advice, give you social support, and hold you accountable. That's the very first thing I would tell people to do. It's hard to do anything on your own. If I said to you, "Lenny, I want you to start an extraordinarily successful podcast and I want you to do it without any help." You would not be where you are today. So that simple principle, get help.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):
It feels like a part of rule number one. Get out of your own way. Ask for help. Jeffrey, I was nervous for this podcast because I thought this was going to be super uncomfortable stuff. It turns out all of this makes so much sense, and there's a really nice way of framing all of these rules, and there's so much reason to actually invest in these skills. So I really appreciate you putting in the time being here, sharing all these stories and insights. Is there anything else you want to share as a kind of a final note or something to leave listeners with before we wrap up? We did it. We covered everything?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:19):
No, I'm happy. I'm happy you're a very good interviewer, which is why your podcast is so successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:24):
I appreciate that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:25):
I'm happy to spend the time with you, and I hope whoever listens to this will, I hope, first of all, there'll be a lot of listeners, but I also hope that they will find it useful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):
I know they will. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they, or find your book, I guess, if they want to learn more? And then how can listeners be useful to you?

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:19:41):
So you can find my book anywhere where books are sold. Don't look at a physical bookstore because nobody carries it, including actually Stanford bookstore, where they run out of it if people... And you can find it on Amazon. Seven Rules of Power. So that's how you can find the book. By the way, at the end of the book I talk about, I have a personal website, jeffreypfeffer.com. If you go to that website, you can find my course outline. So you can take the course on your own if you want, or get somebody or take it in a group of people.

(01:20:13):
You can find research, you can find articles, you can find columns. You can follow me on LinkedIn or I don't do Twitter anymore, but you can follow me on LinkedIn. So there are a lot of resources available for this. A company was once thinking of hiring me to give a talk in their organization, and the woman who wound up hiring me said, "When I was discussing you and arguing that we should hire you for this presentation, one of the people in the committee said, is he a good presenter?" And her answer, I love this. I remember this. Her answer was, "He's a fabulous educator." My job is to educate. That is why I have done what I have done for now more than 50 years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:03):
Holy moly. I didn't even realize that.

Jeffrey Pfeffer (01:21:06):
For more than 50 years, I have been in the business of education. Not just about power, but about many other things as well. But I'm in the education business, so I'm happy to provide people with the resources, with the readings. The Seven Rules of Power is well footnoted. It talks at the end about we could reach out for the coaches. You can go to the website and get the book. But I think consistent with what you and I have talked about, if all you do is read, you're not going to make very much progress. You have to do it. You cannot learn tennis by reading about tennis, or by watching a movie about Serena or Venus Williams. You have to actually get out on the court and do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:51):
Which is a good plug for your other book, the Knowing-Doing Gap, which actually helps you with the skill, which you can also find all your finer retailers. Jeffrey Pfeffer, thank you so much for being here.

## Transcript

Jeremy Henrickson (00:00:00):
It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there. You guys do this over here." When in fact, where you really learn where the challenges are, or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated. And so I try to do that as often as I can, and I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise.

Lenny (00:00:32):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, for interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jeremy Henrickson. Jeremy is senior vice president of product at Rippling, where he leads the product and design teams. Previously, he was chief product officer at Coinbase where he oversaw 10 x growth of the product and engineering organizations and helped scale Coinbase during one of the craziest times in the crypto markets. In our conversation, Jeremy shares his lessons about maintaining velocity at scale, creating a culture of fast decision-making, the importance of product leaders going deep on a problem, and becoming world experts at their domain. What to look for in product managers you're interviewing, why relying on frameworks can be so detrimental to your success, why you may want to avoid MVPs and instead designed for the most complex use cases first, and tons more. Enjoy this episode with Jeremy Henrickson after a short word from our sponsors.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:30):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:32):
So I've heard nothing but amazing things about you and I'm excited to learn from what you've learned from your experience at Rippling, at Coinbase, and all of the products and teams that you've built. And so thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:03:45):
Yeah, super happy to be here.

Lenny (00:03:46):
So I want to start with your time at Coinbase where you were chief product officer and you were chief product officer during maybe the craziest time in the crypto markets. It was I think 2016, 2018 when I was looking at the Bitcoin prices and it was like it went from a $1000 to $20,000 I think in a matter of months. So I'm curious, what was that experience like, and in particular, what was like leading a product team through that experience?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:11):
The strongest memories for me are during 2017 where crypto, which had kind of been at its nadir in early 2016 and slowly started climbing out, just kind of took off and became a real thing in the public consciousness. And Coinbase, which at the time had an exchange just like on-ramp and off-ramp from fiat to crypto and back experienced over the course of 2017 40 x growth in usage.

Lenny (00:04:39):
That's like a dream come true for a lot of people.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:04:42):
No, I mean it was both a dream and a nightmare and I was incredibly lucky to be working on it with a team of people that I could really trust and could stand shoulder-to-shoulder within the trenches. And it was a lot of learning about how you can rapidly scale systems over time and people like to trade crypto on Saturday mornings, so a lot of Saturday mornings just some new thing would break on the edges of the system and we need to get in there and work on it. And so it was just a lot of really incredible lessons about who you choose to work with and focus and making sure you have the right people in the room at the right time.

Lenny (00:05:25):
Okay. So let's actually unpack a couple of those. So focus is really interesting and something people always talk about, but hard to actually do. I guess how did you keep the team focused? I imagine just everyone's getting rich all over the place in crypto.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:39):
Huh.

Lenny (00:05:39):
Things are breaking all the time, like how did you maintain focus on your team?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:05:43):
Well, the first thing is you don't talk about people getting rich. It's a very technical, you talk about like its customers, it's their money, and number one, it had to be secure. So there's a guy named Philip Barton, a friend of mine now, and he is just this amazing security leader at Coinbase, and he was able to always put these decisions that we were making extremely quickly in context and say, "Look, these are the kinds of decisions we can make and still have it be secure no matter how fast we need to move." And so security was always the number one thing. And then the second thing is focusing on both the kind of immediate nature of the issue. Hey, site is down or whatever, and resolving that, but also trying to set those in a context of where we need to go over the next six months. What are we actually shooting for? What do we believe the volumes are going to be? What's it going to take to have everything from a user experience to the deep back end of the product that what would actually work for them?

Lenny (00:06:41):
What was maybe the biggest challenge as a product leader trying to keep people focused and everything on the rails as things were going 40 x?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:06:50):
I think the biggest challenge was that in crypto there's just so much uncertainty in general, simple questions like, is Ethereum going to be a thing, are the subject of debate. And no one actually at the time had an answer to that question. Lots of really strong opinions and so you have to be able to have those debates because lots is going on, but then you have to be able to come out of those conversations with a clear kind of company point of view that you're all shooting toward. And while there may still be differing points of views and debates that happen on the margins, you go full speed toward this answer until you decide to go full speed toward a different answer. And I thought we were pretty successful at that at Coinbase and it wasn't always easy.

Lenny (00:07:32):
Maybe just a last question there.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:34):
Sure.

Lenny (00:07:34):
Living through a time like that, a lot of people are going through these periods of just intense work and it's like, holy moly, this isn't crazy stressful working, like incredibly long hours, but then you look back at those times, and end up being some most important meaningful periods of your career.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:07:50):
Mm-hmm.

Lenny (00:07:52):
I guess one is that, is that your experience too? And then two, I guess is there any advice for someone that's maybe going through something like that of just here's maybe the silver lining of being in a period like that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:08:03):
So it's hard, right? It wasn't always easy. I had a new daughter who had been born just a few months earlier, really tough to balance those things, but I've always loved the rate of learning. And so it is those experiences I feel that have most sort of accelerated my own personal growth and personal learnings because it's in the crucible of things being hard. And so I think when people are going through those times, it's nice to take a step back and talk with friends or whatever about what's really going on and setting it in the context of, hey, three, four or five years now from now when we look back on this, you realize, wow. A, we did something amazing with that time. And B, we learned a lot and we were able to take that with us into whatever we were doing next after that.

Lenny (00:08:52):
Before our chat, I'd asked you what people ask you for advice most around, and you said that people often ask you for advice on how to maintain velocity at scale, which is something every founder and product leader is always striving to do. And so what have you learned and what do you tell people about maintaining and maybe even improving velocity as you scale?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:09:12):
I think there's a lot of different answers here, and I think a lot of them are very specific to the nature of the business that someone's in, like different businesses can maintain velocity in different ways. I think there's kind of a universal truth that you want small teams with clear missions. Right? If there's 300 people trying to work on one thing, the just sheer communication challenges, Dunbar's number, all of those things come into play and it's really, really hard to act quickly. And so having smaller groups of people breaking down what is always a very, very large problem into sufficiently small bits that small groups can attack wholeheartedly and minimize horizontal communication, I think is the first thing. I think the second thing is that to the extent it's like a technology problem. The more you can bake into a clear platform, it reduces the decision-making complexity for everyone who's working on the domain part of the problem.

(00:10:09):
And so a clear like a platform with a clear interface [inaudible 00:10:12] easy to use in all the ways that both engineers and product people want it to be easy to use, simplifies the space in which people have to think about these problems. And that's not always easy. Platforms are not, you can't just write a platform and hope it's going to work for the products. It's very much an iterative thing, but the more one can invest in that and have the right kinds of people who are capable of doing that sort of both systems thinking and product thinking simultaneously, I think is really important. The third thing, just from a leadership point of view is diving deep. Right? It's very, very tempting to float up here as a leader and say, "Hey, you take that hill over there, you guys do this over here." When in fact where you really learn where the challenges are or the problems or the successes is by just being there with the people in the trenches on one of the things, whichever one seems hardest or most complicated.

(00:11:05):
And so I try to do that as often as I can. And I found that I always learn a lot by going through that detailed exercise. And I think the last thing is it's just making sure that teams have the right distribution of experience and seniority. Sometimes you get a team started and the team is perhaps doing something that's zero-to-one and they're amazing at all this zero-to-one stuff.

(00:11:28):
And then two or three years later, those same people are trying to scale the product to millions of people and it turns out that A, they don't like that part of the job as much, and B, maybe they're not as good at it. So I think you [inaudible 00:11:40] constantly look at the team and make sure that a people are doing things that they love and if they're not like, Hey, we've tried this other thing instead and recalibrate the team and make sure the right kind of skill sets are there. And I found if you do all of those things and then have product leadership where we're saying this is what we need to do and very, very clear and precise on what needs to be done, then you can usually actually even accelerate over time because you bake more into this platform, it allows your engineers to do more with less, and that's always pretty amazing.

Lenny (00:12:07):
Okay, let me dig into a couple of these. These are really great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:10):
[inaudible 00:12:10] please.

Lenny (00:12:12):
So with the small teams with clear missions, is there an example of that at Rippling or Coinbase where that was a really good example of this being true?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:12:20):
One example is maybe three years ago when I was just starting at the company, we decided that we needed to build a time and attendance product, lots of market demand for us and that we hadn't built it yet, something that many customers need. And so there were a bunch of ways we could have chosen to do that, but the way we did it was to say, look, let's find one engineer, really talented systems engineer who's actually capable of doing kind of product thinking and have Parker, CEO also spend time on it. And you start there and Sachit brought a few people on with him.

(00:12:56):
And those four people over the course of maybe nine months or so, built a time and attendance product. It was the only thing they were doing. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with our payroll product except to the extent they had to integrate with them a little bit. They didn't have to worry about what was going on with the benefits team or our IT products. They were monomaniacally focused on this one thing and then identifying the places where yes, you, there's connectivity to the rest of the suite, and that allowed them to move extremely quickly.

Lenny (00:13:24):
How much of that was Parker being on the team, helping them unblock everything versus being very small and focused?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:13:30):
I think it was mostly small and focused. Obviously, Parker can do things and unblock them in the way that only a CEO can and that helps. But the thing is at Rippling, like we've now replicated that a dozen times. That's our model for starting new things. And so it can't just be him unblocking things, though he does unblock things. It's more that this pattern of having these small groups be able to do things and then being able to have go to those people, whether you're Parker or somebody else in the company, and be able to say, Hey, how are things going? Or are we working on the right things? Or let's see the latest designs for that thing and comment on it.

(00:14:05):
All of those things can happen just at a much greater tempo than if you're trying to go three layers down into the org and do things. I think that's the other, maybe the key point here that everyone is exposed senior leadership, yes, we have a management structure because you have to, but that management structure does not interfere with the ability of anyone anywhere in the organization to look at what's actually happening. And that happens very directly.

Lenny (00:14:29):
So let's talk about that model you just described. So what is that model? So this is how you approach new products, and I know within Rippling there's many, many products and features we're going to talk about this. And you're saying that you have kind of an approach to adding a new business unit essentially, or a new product feature.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:14:43):
What is that model roughly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:14:45):
Yeah, so the model's quite simple. In the vast majority of cases, we realize we need to build something and we have the one-page view of what that is. And usually, we're lucky enough that the things we're building sort of exist in some form in the industry today, not in the differentiated way that we can build it, but time and attendance is an example. That's a well-known thing in the industry. There's whole companies that do only that, right? So we start there, we find a single engineer who is extremely entrepreneurial, understands what it means to operate at tempo, understands what it means to make decisions with low information, understands how to work very, very quickly with a design partner.

(00:15:22):
So we have a design partner and we say, "Look, come into Rippling, spend a few months getting to know the platform first of all. So go work on this other team, understand what's easy for them, what's hard for them, how the platform works, how other products have been built on top of this. Go talk with other people who founded products here and understand what their experience is so that you can learn from and iterate on it, get an opinion about your product, and then start building it."

(00:15:48):
And during this intervening time, they're also recruiting a team of usually 2, 3, 4 other engineers who kind of have that same zero-to-one mentality and they start building. And usually over the course of six to nine months, we can get a product from a blank sheet of paper to something that is launched or at least that we're using internally when we dogfood our stuff really heavily. And then it grows from there. And then sometimes when you launch one of these products, you get close to launch, you realize, hey, actually a team of five or six people can handle this product ad nauseam. Sometimes you have to bump it up. It's like, okay, this thing's about to go to production, there's all these other things to do, the team needs now needs to go from 4 to 15 or something like that. Really depends on the product, but that's the general life cycle and then you keep growing and scaling it.

Lenny (00:16:34):
That is fascinating. So just so I understand, you find a founder type to take the lead on a new idea and do you recruit them internally or you sometimes find them externally just to focus on this product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:34):
Interesting.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:34):
Both.

Lenny (00:16:46):
Okay. And then you find a design partner for them to work with to figure out what exactly needs to be built. And is it idea pick one design partner or you try to encourage a few?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:16:57):
Usually, it's one. So there's a designer, so we have a design-

Lenny (00:17:00):
Oh, design partner, meaning a designer, not a company that is like their partner in design.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:06):
Oh, no, no, no. Literally, somebody who knows Rippling's products, knows our component library, knows all of that stuff and is skilled and doing UX and interaction and visual design.

Lenny (00:17:19):
Got it. Okay, design. Okay, cool. And then they basically with maybe a couple engineers, just that's the team that initiates a new product line and then launches it, and then as it scales, it maybe grows the team, maybe not.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:17:33):
Yep, that's right. And it's pretty ad hoc, but every couple of weeks or something like that, they're meeting with me or with Parker or whichever one of us is the DRI on it and giving feedback on the designs, having a critical life or like "Oh man, if I were using this as a admin, a small company or an admin at a large company, how would I feel about this? Would this interface work for me?" And so we were pressure testing it throughout that cycle and trying to get the balance of speed and comprehensiveness, right.

Lenny (00:18:03):
This reminds me you're also, I hear not a big fan of MVPs that you building products to further point. Is that true? And then if so, how do you think about the initial version of a product?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:18:16):
First of all, I don't want to knock on MVPs. I think MVPs have their place extremely useful, particularly if you're literally the zero-to-one company that's never done anything before and you don't have clear market validation. I think in our case specifically for Rippling, a minimum viable product would do a disservice to both our customers and to the very team that was building it. And the reason I believe that is that when you design a minimum viable product, you're optimizing for speed. And in that set of optimizations, you are minimizing the deeper product thinking about what can fully differentiate our product based on not only existing kind of capabilities within our products and platform, but based on what it ought to do in the future.

(00:19:03):
And so it sort of limits product creativity, but worse, it leads to building the wrong thing technically, right? So if you're only thinking through the simple cases and you're an engineer and no one's pushing you on saying, "Wait, what about that healthcare hospital administration case where it's mission-critical life," then you're going to make a different set of as architectural assumptions, and then you're going to build on those and you're going to build on those for six months, nine months a year, and you'll have dozens or 100s of assumptions built on top of those.

(00:19:38):
And it's extremely difficult to unwind those decisions once you've built them into the product. And therefore we believe very deeply it's like, sure, understand those simple cases. Understand if you're a two-person company, you don't need all of these other things. And what is the product going to look like for you to approach it but also understand what it would mean to have 10,000 people globally around the world with this ridiculously hard use case? What's the model that would support that? And let's make sure that as we're doing the technical and product design for this thing, that it accommodates that view, even if we're not going to support it in the first version, even if we make the product decision to say, "Look, we actually don't need to handle that case right now." You still build the product in a way that's not going to prevent you from getting there in the future. And does that take a little more time? Sure, yeah. But does it save you time in the long run? Absolutely. Right. And so that's our approach.

Lenny (00:20:39):
Is there an example that comes to mind of a product you build at Rippling or Coinbase of just, it could have been this really simple MVP and then ended up being like, no, we did the right thing by building it further along the spectrum.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:20:49):
Yeah. So I think a great example of this at Rippling is our global payroll product. We could have said, "Hey, look, we just need to support this one country. We need to support, whatever, the UK," let's say. So we're going to copy all of our US stuff, just replicate it and change all the things to be UK-like. That would've been the fastest thing to do to dramatically oversimplify, but that's not what we did. What we did is we said, look, we need to launch a six countries and these are six super different countries that we want to look at. And they're going to have different requirements from an HRIS standpoint, from an employer of record standpoint, from how you pay global contractors, from how payroll works, and we're going to make a system that works for those countries. And there's lots of downstream implications for that.

(00:21:39):
But what it means is that now our global payroll system, adding a country is, it's not easy, but it's a lot easier than it would've been if you had to continue to stamp out and replicate and then of course maintain all of these things that have very little underlying connectivity. And instead, what we have is 80% of the system is baked into our global payroll platform, and then the 20% is country-specific. And most of that specificity can be handled not by engineers who are very, very expensive to change things that are local specific, but instead can be configured by somebody that's in compliance, by somebody that's in legal that needs to get the right documents into the system. And all of that stuff can be handled by the system, which allows us to move much faster sort of going forward.

Lenny (00:22:27):
I've heard you describe this kind of idea as you encourage teams to design for the most complex use case first.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:27):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:22:32):
Is that kind of the instruction you give these teams?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:22:35):
100%, many times. And so it's one of these things that until you're here, it's a really difficult thing to kind of grok because A, it's so counterculture to what the background that most people have come from. It's like, no, no, no, don't think about all those things. Just zoom in on this one case, use it as a wedge, and then grow from there. And this is one of the reasons that we have people, especially new people in these kind of founding roles, come in and spend a few months just absorbing the culture to really learn these lessons. And it's one reason that we're extremely high touch with kind of new products in their infancy to make sure that we just don't fall into that trap, right? Especially because simultaneously with doing this, we're like, "Hey, but we need to ship this as fast as possible." Right? And so you want to get the balance of those two things right.

Lenny (00:23:17):
So when I think about Rippling, I think of you got the culture is to do things the hard way and the right way. And an element of that is there's this concept that I've heard that Rippling is this compound startup? What does that term mean? And then how does that approach impact the way you build product and organize teams and all the things you were just talking about of MVPs and build new products?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:23:40):
The idea of a compound startup for us is that we're basically a lot of businesses that all work together. If you think about the products we offer, we have payroll, well, there's entire companies built just on payroll, insurance, and benefits, entire companies. That's our entire life. In fact, a fragment of benefits is the entire life cycle of a whole company. Our IT products, device management, and identity management, time and attendance, each of these things are industries into themselves with multi-billion dollar companies serving each of them. The insight Parker had before he founded the company was actually the result you get that when you have that is that there's all this data that gets replicated and copied and as impossible to keep in sync everywhere. The right answer is to have a single system of record, one place, one database where all of that information is resident so that each of these downstream systems can always have the right data at the right time.

(00:24:34):
And then you can build on top of that things like workflow and reporting and analytics and permissioning and all these kinds of underlying capabilities. So the idea of a compound startup is all of these different businesses benefit from being built on top of one platform. The activation energy for that is extremely high. So before my time at the company, Parker, Prasanna, the technical founder, and others, built all of the first versions of all these products and it was a minor miracle, they were able to do that. But having done it, we then had that platform and we could continue to build new verticals and new startups on top of that foundation.

Lenny (00:25:16):
This touches on something that comes up a number of times in this podcast, which is the importance of differentiation. And it feels like this is the differentiator for Rippling. It's not going to be just a better one of these vertical solutions like the main differentiators, we're going to do it all and everything's going to be so much better because it's all in one platform. Is that kind of where the original idea came from or is there a different way to think about that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:25:38):
Yeah, I think that's right. So I mean, the fundamental contention is having a single system of record is better for many, many, many reasons, right? The most simple of which is there's a single source of truth and all of these other products can rely on it. But also, unless you start without assumption of everything being in a single system of record, there's a bunch of other things you can't do. You can't build out a, I don't know, a permissioning system that looks at the various attributes across all of these products. You now suddenly have to do an integration and each of these products talks different languages. You can't do simple things, build a product and say, who is this person's manager? Most products, you can't do that. Most products you find some system of truth, export everybody's name and email address and a spreadsheet, have another email address or another name, maybe an employee ID of who that person reports to and upload that to another system, which by the way is immediately out of date because organizational structures change all the time.

(00:26:35):
Whereas with Rippling, it's always correct. We are the system of record. So all of our products, they're like, "Hey, who's that person's manager." And the system immediately knows. And that's a very, very simple example of something that you can only do if you start with solve it to come back to an earlier point, like solve the most complex use case first, solve the fact that this data all needs to be in the same place. And so our ability to differentiate boils down to that one fundamental decision, which just allows us to do things that are literally impossible for any other company to do.

Lenny (00:27:09):
What would you say is one of the most unique things about Ripplings culture that maybe you haven't mentioned yet?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:27:15):
I would say it's fundamental, speed of execution. I think in speed of decision-making. It's the thing that is probably the hardest to explain to people before they're here. It's hard to understand until you experience it. It's like let's not schedule a meeting for next week or tomorrow or later today. We're in the middle of a meeting, we need to make a decision. Let's either make the decision or if we can't, let's Slack call in the person that we need in order to make that decision. And we'll be done with the decision today.

(00:27:44):
And like sure there are irreversible decisions you can't make that way, but for the most part, we really value the tempo of decision-making and the speed of response. And no company I've been at any scale, 5 people, 5,000 people, has ever operated at the tempo this one does. And I think that our ability to continue to operate at that tempo, which is partly due to the fact that we are a compound startup and have these small teams independently operating teams and all the rest of that is a really differentiating thing about the culture of the company.

Lenny (00:28:14):
I'm reading Kevin Kelly's new book where I don't know if you've seen his new book. It's all these little tidbits of advice and one of his pieces of advice is that usually the best time to do something is right now. And that feels like that resonates with the way you all think. I'm curious just how you create that culture and ability to make decisions fast. Is it purely top-down founder, this is how they behave, or is there something else that you found as effective to create this culture of moving fast, making decisions really quickly?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:28:43):
Obviously, a huge piece of this is Parker himself. It's an attribute of his personality, he likes making decisions quickly, and it's also a deliberate strategic decision on his part to have a company that makes decisions quickly. And so he models this constantly, right, in Slack, in conversations in person, and in every way possible. And there's an expectation throughout the company. If you kind of look at our leadership principles, this ability to make decisions quickly is something that kind of everybody promulgates. But also I think there's a number of things we've done to bake it in the way that we even do say quarterly planning. And the fact that there's this timeline for decision-making that doesn't leave a lot of room in the way that we expect people to know their domains, especially in product, right?

(00:29:29):
In product, you don't own little feature, you own your product and you're expected to be the world's foremost expert in it. And if you are, what that means is instead of having to come back to people three days later with an answer, just off the top of your head, you can be like, "Yes, this is what I think I should do about that or give me 30 minutes, look something up and I can tell you what we need to do about that." And so all of those things in combination just yield an environment in which these decisions happen very quickly.

Lenny (00:29:55):
You talked about quarterly planning and you're saying that there's like, here's the timelines we need to make decisions on these dates, and there's a culture of just we stay firm to that. And if you don't, then we're going to move on.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:06):
That's right. And it's shocking to people when we actually move on, right, that haven't been here yet. It's like, no, no, that date passed. You don't get to retroactively make everybody react to the fact that you didn't operate quickly enough, right? And it's not a hostile thing, it's just a, people just have to get used to. It's a deep cultural principle. And the fact that everyone stands behind it just means it's gets reinforced on its own, out of its own gravity.

Lenny (00:30:34):
Do you have internal values that you've kind of outlined that are a part of this? Or is that not something that you find super valuable?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:30:42):
No, actually I find them quite valuable. And actually our COO, Matt MacInnis, who joined the company about a year before I did, he has been the one to really drive this and you go to, I can't remember this specific URL, but on Rippling there's a search Rippling leadership principles. There they are. And they are really true to the culture of the company. The way we came up with them was to us a couple years ago, to introspect and to what actually made people successful at the company? Like who's successful, why are they successful? Why do they enjoy being here? Or alternatively the opposite, like why people not worked out, why do some people not enjoy it here? And those are the things that are differentiating and those are the things that we wrote down.

Lenny (00:31:23):
Are you hiring or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity? Well, either way, check out lennysjobs.com/talent. If you're a hiring manager, you can sign up and get access to hundreds of hand-curated people who are open to new opportunities. Thousands of people apply to join this collective. And I personally review and accept just about 10% of them. You won't find a better place to hire product managers and growth leaders. Join almost a 100 other companies who are actively hiring through this collective. And if you're looking around for a newer opportunity actively or passively join the collective, it's free. You can be anonymous and you can even hide yourself from specific companies. You can also leave any time and you'll only hear from companies that you want to hear from. Check out lennysjobs.com/talent. For someone listening that's like, we need to move faster. And everyone always feels this, we need to move faster, we make decisions faster. What piece of advice would you give someone for helping them do this at their company?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:32:27):
I think it's really context-dependent, but I think it starts with whoever is in the role of making the top-level product decisions of them being one extremely clear about what those priorities are and more importantly, extremely clear about what all the priorities aren't. Right? There are so many things that could be important or people can make the case for being important or whatever that are fundamentally distracting from the core mission of getting something done.

(00:32:55):
But secondly, for that person to go all the way to ground on it, we have one of the leadership principles is go and see. Right? So to look at the thing and then walk all the way to ground and talk with the engineer who's writing the code on the thing. Because inevitably this top-level communication is insufficient to get to the detail of what matters and doesn't matter. And you don't have to do that everywhere, but if you do it in enough places, what it does is it creates a clear expectation of that kind of clarity across the board and forces everyone to up their game a little bit and just helps people understand what the expectation is. Right? And I think in the absence of those sort of clear expectations, it's difficult for people to perform at their best. Right? And so we try to do that pretty frequently.

Lenny (00:33:43):
Okay. I definitely want to spend more time on this, but before we get there, so go and see. I love that. And that actually has come up recently on a number of podcasts, just the importance of people continuing to ask questions and going to the end of what's possible. Recent story was IO talking about building the cash card and going to the warehouse and watching the printings of the cards and things like that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:34:04):
I guess first of all, do you have a sense of where that came from and why that ended up being so important to y'all? And then two is there an example of you doing that or someone you've seen do that and that leading to something really important?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:34:16):
In the early days of our global efforts, when we were first trying to figure out what global payroll was, it was really tempting to say, "Oh, well we're going to go into the UK and that's going to be relatively similar to what we're doing in the US." But our kind of head of payroll went in and said, actually, here are the ways in which we knew it was going to be different, but here are the ways in which we didn't anticipate that it was going to be different, which made us realize that we had to completely alter our approach for how we think about learning about each of these countries and going into them and having a fulsome experience.

(00:34:50):
And that then backs into things like, well, every country does tax filings, every country does them slightly differently, but how are we going to build a tax filing system that's going to allow us to satisfy the needs of every country in which we're going to run payroll? And it was only through that very early on deep look at how one country was actually operating and then doing the same thing with the next country that we were able to set in motion, all of those things. It's not like we knew all the answers at that point, but it allowed us at a much earlier stage to put in motion a bunch of stuff that we need to do that then got subsequently much more clarified and much more precise over time.

Lenny (00:35:30):
And so the leader of that team basically just went and studied the tax laws of each-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:35:36):
... country.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:35:36):
That's right, went all the way to ground. It's like, okay, let's go and open up the big old, I mean, it's online these days, the big old textbook and look like it's, or you're in the United States, it's like you have to go look at Ohio or Pennsylvania, which have all these little local city or county based taxes. And it's incredibly instructive to look at just a few of those and think, wow, how do I think about configuring these change unannounced? Some city administrator or the city legislature, whatever they call them, they decide to change the tax rate. Well, how are we going to know about that? How are we going to change it? How are we going to change it so it's effective at the right time?

(00:36:14):
And you don't think about those things until you've gone all the way to ground and looked at how these things are actually worked, how they're communicated, and how they're thought through. And I think the same thing is true of every aspect of every product in different ways. Right? It might be a technical thing, it might be a design thing, it might be a compliance or a regulatory or a governmental thing, but whatever it is, that detail always exists. And unless you're getting down there and seeing it and understanding it firsthand, you don't really understand what your product needs to do.

Lenny (00:36:42):
And I think an important element of this that's between the lines maybe is don't delegate this to someone. You may have a tax expert on the team, and I imagine many leaders would be like, go figure this out and tell me. And I think what you're saying is you go do that and learn, become the world expert at it.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:36:55):
That's right. That's right. You go do it. You go learn and then we can make the case for hiring the tax expert, which we do have by the way now. That's an incredibly important part of our success is having that specialist but not before somebody with a product mindset. The tax specialist is amazing at tax, right? That's what they're, they love and that's what they do, but that doesn't make them necessarily a great product thinker. So the person with the product thing has to get into those same weeds first to really understand it.

Lenny (00:37:24):
Do you give any guidance and just how much time to spend on all that stuff versus the regular day-to-day of, say, a product leader on a team, it takes a lot of time to become a world expert on the tax systems of many countries, or is it just there's nothing more important than that, that is your job, and what are you doing not doing that? How do you think about it?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:37:42):
I think it's equally if a job is 80 hours a week, it's 40 of your hours. I think that you can't really understand a product unless you've gone there. Right? And yes, it takes time and you're right, you can't just ignore the other half of the job of communicating with the engineering team and writing documents or whatever, but what's the point of writing a document if you don't know what you're talking about? And so we very deeply value that. And it's one of the reasons that we keep, at least at Rippling, our product organization really thin. We expect a single leader to be able to know the full scope of the product. In fact, great product leaders can in fact do that because they have this native curiosity and interest and ability to absorb a lot of stuff. And it makes, it's a lot of fun because now I have a group of people around me who are all really good at what they do and really understand what they do and that's kind of just an amazing place to be.

Lenny (00:38:42):
I'm looking at this list and I just want to keep asking questions about it. One of the sure principles that I love is it reminds me of Amazon has the same principle I believe, which is leaders are right a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:38:52):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:53):
Why do you find that to be important? I know you weren't necessarily design all these principles, but I imagine that something that you guys follow often and comes up a lot.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:39:01):
I mean, this is one of my favorite ones because I think particularly for a product org, right? Because product leaders have to be right most of the time because their decisions reflect across the entire org and their decisions fundamentally spend time and they spend energy. And if they make good ones, the company does really well. And if they make bad ones, the company doesn't. And one of the things I really value in product leaders are people who can go into an ambiguous information with ambiguous situation, with incomplete information and a complex decision space and can look at that and listen to everybody and read whatever they need to read and say, this is where we need to go.

(00:39:43):
And even if everyone else is like, ah, I don't know, that feels wrong for this reason, this reason if they have the confidence to make that call, and then a year later when you look back on it, for them to have been right, that's extremely valuable. And it's one of these things that it's really hard to test for. You can get it by talking with people and asking, "Hey, was this person usually right in respect?" And people think about it, but in the context of a given company, just you have to take the time and see if those decisions are largely right. And it's the one value we have. It's like you can't really learn it. Either you're really, really good at making those kinds of decisions or you're not, right? It's a very peculiar skill that we really value.

Lenny (00:40:28):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit, I know you all are going through this global expansion. We talked about this a little bit.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:28):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:35):
And so just a few questions along this lines, because a lot of companies start one country, most companies do, and then they decide let's expand to new markets. So I guess first question is just how do you decide which markets to go after? And specifically where to start first and then just prioritizing the list of markets? What's kind of your algorithm for that?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:40:55):
So it starts with an assumption that we're going to have to be everywhere ultimately, that you don't actually have to build native global payroll in every country in the world. Just makes sense to do that every country in the world. But you definitely want to be able to pay people in any country in the world and you want to be able to have contractors anywhere in the world and have their information be in your HRS anywhere in the world. And so the decision for us, we were fortunate to, or when we made that decision, to have quite a few customers already, like thousands of customers. And so we knew not only where their kind of US employees were, but by virtue of being an employee system work, we actually knew where they had other employees. And so it was quite easy for us to say, focusing on US-based companies, which is incomplete data.

(00:41:35):
But if we just look at our US-based companies, we know that there is immediate demand for those people to pay people in countries X, Y, and Z. And we just listed those out in raw numerical order. And then we kind of looked at, okay, how hard is it to build in these countries and how valuable is it to build in these countries? What is the strategic value of building in the UK or Canada or Germany or India or wherever? And then we had a discussion on where is there risk or where is this hard? Where is there a long pull? Where does this like, in what countries does it take a long time to get approval or whatever? And we just stack-ranked them and then we revisited that decision. The early decisions that we made on exactly which countries. We have subsequently reordered those over time. And as we've dove, dived in the countries, and learned more, we rejigger things like a little bit. But for the most part, that same basic list we started with is still mostly right.

Lenny (00:42:29):
Okay. And then the other question a lot of founders always struggle with is when is the time to start expanding internationally? Because there's pros and cons. Do you have a sense of what convinced y'all to start going international?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:42:41):
I think our case is slightly special, but I think the right answer to that question is always before you think you do before you think you need to because there are, it's harder than everyone if they've never done it before, it's harder than you think it is. It's more specialized than you think it is. People in the UK really, really care if there is a U in color, just as we care if there's not a U in color. There's just all of these subtle lessons that, like cultural lessons for companies that take a really, really long time to absorb. And so my view is you always should do it earlier than you think you should that, than you think you have to. In our case, it was always something we knew we had to do. In fact, we have a very clear thesis that companies that aren't global, particularly in payroll, but also in kind of insurance and benefits in IT. If you're not global, you're just not going to be around in 10 years because companies were becoming global, and then COVID happened and companies became global much faster.

(00:43:35):
It stopped being the province of 100-person companies plus and started filtering down into very, very small companies. It just became commonplace for small companies to be multi-country. And so that very much accelerated our timetable. And then you saw other people noticed that too, and you saw other companies starting to try to address parts of this problem as well. And so there's this kind of competitive dimension, which is sort of secondary in most ways because we were going to do it anyway, but that also kind of adds a little bit of a fire under the thing.

Lenny (00:44:06):
What have you found to be most surprising about expanding internationally to be successful in expansion? For folks that are maybe starting down this road of like, oh shoot, we should think about that.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:44:16):
I think the thing that was most surprising to me the first time I did this back at Guidewire in the [inaudible 00:44:23] and remains the most surprising thing to most people every time I do this again, is that every country is unique. You can't just take your US-based approach and drop it into another country. Other countries find it insulting. It doesn't matter how much success you've had here. Everyone always believes rightly or wrongly that their local context is special. And you have to respect that. And it comes down to little things like they're being a you in color or not. Or if you ever see a demo delivered to somebody in another country where they see a detailed screen about a person and it includes a social security number, it's like that you immediately lose credibility. Doesn't matter how good all the rest of your stuff is.

(00:45:08):
And I think that that is consistently the thing that I think is most surprising to people is the degree to which that's true, which seems obvious in retrospect. If you took a German system or something and demoed it in the United States with poorly translated stuff, we would think it would suck too. But it's not, it's really hard to adapt to that mindset. And so it takes just a lot of energy to overcome that organizationally.

Lenny (00:45:32):
Makes tons of sense. I'm going to go in a different direction now.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:36):
Sure.

Lenny (00:45:36):
Frameworks. So I know that you're not a huge fan of frameworks. We were chatting about this before we started recording. And so I'm curious just to hear your perspective on why you're maybe not a fan of frameworks and then also just how you crystallize processes and concepts for your team if you're not just like, Hey, here's our framework you should use.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:45:54):
Look, I think frameworks are very helpful. So I'm not exactly anti-framework, but I am anti-process as a substitution for deep product thinking, right? So I like to have just enough process to create a frame so that the right decisions can happen and know more. And I think there's a danger, especially as companies scale, that you end up saying, well, if only we categorize everything correctly and Jira, like we will be able to make really good prioritization decisions. So I'm like, sure, extremely helpful to have clear categorization and things that Jira doesn't have like data and analysis and to be able to do all of that stuff. But what you really need to do is decide important to build and then have a way to build it really efficiently. And so I think the right answer, the right amount of process for any given team is like, or the right framework for any team is really just dependent on their specific life cycle.

(00:46:47):
So you won't see me saying like, oh, we need to use this scrum thing or that combine thing, or whatever the latest, newest thing is. It's like, don't care about any of that. What I care is about something that's going to enable this team in this context at this point in their life cycle to build the right thing as efficiently as possible. And I'm fine if those are different for different teams. And the only place I care about unification is one on the quarterly planning process. And two, everything does need in fact to be in Jira because otherwise, you can't rationalize about what's actually getting done in not.

Lenny (00:47:18):
Is there a process or framework that you find is counterproductive that you're just stay away from this thing? We've had a lot of trouble with it, or generally, it's like let's just rethink everything ourselves.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:47:31):
No, I don't find one to be particular, I don't consistently found one to be particularly problematic. So I think any framework sort of has its place, the right place, right time. I think there's danger any one time somebody like dogmatically says, I think we should use process X because that's almost never the right answer in my experience. I think there are places where that can differ. Like you start a company on the basis of process X and everyone's bought into that process and everyone understands it. I think they can be really, really great. And on the engineering side, I think this is hugely valuable. It's like test driven-development, first line of code's going to be a test, not the actual thing. Like fantastic, very supportive of all that. I think it's kind of different in the product world.

Lenny (00:48:08):
If you had to compare the way Coinbase builds product process-wise or just product development to Rippling, what would you say are the bigger differences?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:48:17):
I think the differences are largely born of the different domains. So crypto, as we talked about earlier, really hard to predict what's going on. There's all these questions about what's the future of crypto, what's going to matter, what do we even need to build? What's going to survive? And so the process we had at Coinbase run, having those debates and getting to a decision and disagreeing, committing. And then from an execution point of view, being able to move fast. That was the trick at Coinbase. Here we know the things that we need to build at a high level. And the trick is how do we really differentiate it on the basis of these amazing platform capabilities we have? Or how do we have to evolve those platform capabilities in order to continue to build something that's just discontinuously better than everything that's out there? And that yields a different decision-making process. So for me, it's the mental model is actually of how I approach those things with the same, but they just yield different results in the actual making of the software.

Lenny (00:49:12):
What is that actual difference? Do you find day-to-day? Is it timeline differences? Is it how quickly, I don't know the way you structure, how far out you plan, what do you find is the concrete difference as a result?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:49:25):
I think the difference is in the day-to-day velocity of decision-making, because we can, Rippling, if you're on, I don't know, pick a random team. If you're on the device management team, you know what you got to do, right? There's no ambiguity. You're not debating about whether Mac or Windows is going to exist in the future. There's none of that cognitive dissonance. There is, we need to build this. It's hard to figure out how we need to build this, right? Because there's all these different things that we could leverage, but we need to basically get this done.

(00:49:58):
And so the kind of total velocity I would say is higher here, which does not say people work harder or less are at Columbia. Columbia was an amazingly fast environment, but it was also subject to the fact that you just don't know what the crypto markets are going to do, and you have to be incredibly reactive to that. And so I think maybe that's the one thing, like the reactivity to the environment and the crypto environment, what's going on, and the uncertainty of the regulatory environment, all that stuff. We got really, really, really good at handling those things really rapidly, which is something that we need to handle somewhat less [inaudible 00:50:34].

Lenny (00:50:33):
Sounds quite stressful at Coinbase.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:50:38):
Yeah, I mean it was fun. Yes, it was stressful. I mean, every job I've ever had has been stressful, but in its own unique way. But all of that stress I think is in the shape of a problem, that's in the context of a problem that's really interesting. I mean that's why I stayed at these places. But yeah, it's stressful.

Lenny (00:51:00):
And looking back, what a joy.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:02):
Yeah. No, there are very good memories. I look back, I don't really, I remember the stress, but I don't like re-experience it, right. I remember foraging these relationships and building these amazing products that I've been so lucky to be a part of. And so I have almost only good memories of the places I've been.

Lenny (00:51:21):
That's what I find too. You go through these hardships and then you look back and you're like, wow, that was so cool. But assuming they go well, assuming the company works out and-

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:21):
True.

Lenny (00:51:29):
... it feels like it was successful. A lot of times you're at a startup, your life sucks for two years and it doesn't work out and that there is a lot of upside and good memories to that, but it's less glorious.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:51:41):
Yeah, that's fair though. I mean, the first company I was really at out of school's company called Reactivity back in internet one era, and we were trying to figure out how does this internet thing work and how do we start companies on the basis of these tech new technologies and how do we help other companies build stuff and figure it out? And that company fundamentally didn't work out, ultimately got kind of spun itself out and got acquired, which was great, but it was this extraordinary set of people that I was so lucky to work with and I loved all the time I spent there and it was foundational to everything else I ever did. And so even though that effort didn't pay off in the traditional set, the value of the learnings I had there and then the people I had a chance to work with was just really exceptional. So I feel very lucky.

Lenny (00:52:30):
That's a really good point actually. And I think I should correct even what I said that even when things don't work out, traditionally those experiences end up being incredibly valuable in all these unexpected ways.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:42):
Yeah, 100%.

Lenny (00:52:44):
Yeah. Okay, so final topic.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:45):
Sure.

Lenny (00:52:45):
I want to talk about hiring product managers and interviewing.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:52:48):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:49):
So you've hired a lot of PMs over the years. I'm curious, what's something you've learned about what to look for in product managers and also just in product leaders that other people may not be focused on as enough?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:53:00):
I mean, I don't know that I have any particularly special insight here. I think there's a couple things that I do ask that maybe are more of an emphasis because it's Rippling than not. But the first of those is when people are going through our process, there's a part where they do this case study and an important part of the case study is that it's actually too complex for people to have all of the answers upfront. There's just the space of the problem is too large to do that, which means that in the interview there's a lot of opportunities or in the case study there's a lot of opportunities. So just ask ad hoc questions or to change one assumption. And seeing how people react to that is really indicative of how deeply they understand a new problem or how quickly or how mentally agile they are.

(00:53:47):
And some people are extremely good at that here in assumption and they blink a couple times. They're like, oh, well that has these 400 implications. And they just start rattling them off. And some people get really flummoxed. I mean obviously for our environment, that former is really, really important to us. I think the other thing that really matters to me is the insightfulness of questions that people ask, which is indicative of number one, their actual interest in the job.

(00:54:14):
People tend to ask better questions when they're more excited about working at a place and done their research and are asking people about it. And also the quality of those questions can vary quite dramatically. And that's okay. I don't expect the quality to be the same all the time, but sometimes people ask a question, I'm like, "Oh man, I would've never thought to ask that question. That's such an insightful question." And then I pause and I have to think about my answer a little bit. And so it kind of pushes me to be a little bit better. And when that happens, I know I usually have pretty good candidate on my hands.

Lenny (00:54:42):
Is there an example of someone asking a really good question that comes to mind that you think back to and like, Oh wow, that was great.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:54:49):
I remember about three years ago I was interviewing a guy named Kyle Boston and Kyle is now runs our platform product organization. And I can't remember the specific question he asked, but it had something to do with, wait a minute, if you have all these products and you have this employee system of record thing underneath it, we be thinking about how to create these various pillars of underlying platform technology, things like [inaudible 00:55:22] all this stuff. And this was before we fully formalized the concept of our platform beyond the kind of employee system of record.

(00:55:29):
And I remember thinking, yes, we should, and that had entered our minds before, but the fact that somebody which who had almost no context on the company, that's what was impressive about this question. It's like, man, you've been thinking about Rippling for a couple weeks while you're interviewing with a bunch of other companies or whatever. And you've thought about it deeply enough to have this insight into the nature of the platform that we're building immediately gave me a bunch of confidence in his ability to think through the sorts of things we need him to think through.

Lenny (00:55:58):
And I think it touches on PMs need to be business leaders and great questions are often about the business and the future of the business and how to make it run more efficiently and this, and there's a product org element to it. But I find that that's a really underappreciated element of PM interviews, just thinking about the bigger business, not just the PM product.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:56:19):
For me it's two things. It's thinking about the bigger business and having the context around whether it's revenue questions or strategy questions, but also the detailed questions. It's like, oh wait a minute. The implication of this thing that I'm getting asked or of this thing with Jeremy that you said earlier is all of these things. And their ability to understand that this isn't a simple business, it's really hard, it's really complex. And the ability to have these insights to help them think through those details is really cool.

Lenny (00:56:49):
You talked about this prompt you give product managers not to give away what you actually asked these days, but is there an example of a prompt that you've given in the past or you think is a good example of a type of prompt to give a product manager candidate.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:57:01):
In terms of a general kind of approach, I think a prompt should always reflect the actual business that they're going to kind of come into. So when we do, so our process overall is actually quite short. It's basically get in contact with us somehow, eventually get connected with a hiring manager, have a conversation with them. Then more or less you have a conversation with me, which is a product discussion. And then we have a case study which follows that. That's the whole process. Modulo, other conversations around the edges. And the questions that matter are around how do people think through that product discussion, which is relevant to our business. How do people think through that case study? That's number one. And the second thing is there's always a part of my interview, which is maybe sounds very simple, but it's just like, Hey, what questions do you have for me?

(00:57:53):
We actually do that before we do the product discussion. And that's an incredibly important question because it is again indicative of these things that people have thought through or not thought through or the depth that they're thinking or their interest in engagement in the role. And at that second discussion, it doesn't have to be perfect or anything, but it is a very strong signal when people, whether they've thought through a set of questions they want to ask or just on the fly generating them, you learn a lot about how people think about product, about what they're looking for, about what they like doing and not doing, just through those questions.

Lenny (00:58:30):
For PMs that are maybe in their early career that are listening to this, what advice would you give them to help them accelerate and advance their career most in the early part of their career?

Jeremy Henrickson (00:58:41):
Be humble. Being a product person means that by definition you're living in a world where no one knows the right answer yet because if somebody did, they would've already built it. And so having, no matter how smart you are, there's a lot of smart people out there. There's always stuff you don't know. There's always people who are going to know things that you don't know. And it is only through that acknowledgement that you can actually have the humility to say, I'm open to absorbing all of this stuff, I don't know. And open to synthesizing all this stuff and coming to different conclusions.

(00:59:12):
And so I found that that humility is one of the biggest differentiators in early career leaders who are able to let go of how awesome they were in school or in their first job or whatever. I mean, I had to do this and realize the job is always hard and the job is always about discovery every single day. And if you can maintain that curiosity and elasticity of thought and creativity and light coming solutions could be awesome. But if you close yourself off to that and think you always have the right answer, then there's like no hope.

Lenny (00:59:49):
This touches on another principle that I still have sitting on my screen here, which is great leaders change their minds a lot or just change their minds.

Jeremy Henrickson (00:59:57):
Yeah. Willing to look at new information and say, my mental model is adjusted by that or I was wrong very simply. I mean I think it's also important to be operating in an environment where you're allowed to say that you're wrong, right? Everyone's wrong sometimes. I mean be right a lot, but everyone's wrong sometimes. Right? And being in be able to be an environment where you can just say, yep, I was wrong. Here's the way in which I was wrong. Let's move on, is incredibly powerful.

Lenny (01:00:19):
The final question you've brought up Parker a number of times and something that is clear about him is that he's a very product-minded founder. He has a lot of strong opinions about what product should be. And as a product leader with a founder like that is often a challenging place to be similar to being the first PM at a startup and the founder has strong opinions about product. So my question is just what have you learned about being successful as a product leader with a founder that has very strong opinions about what the product should be?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:00:47):
Yeah, no, that's a great question. So I think you've got to be adaptable, right? It's like any other relationship, right? You have to understand what the nature of that relationship is, where that person's going to care, where you're going to care, the ways in which you can challenge each other. I think fundamentally you need to make sure that person is willing to be challenged, right? So I've seen product leaders or CEOs who are kind of unwilling to be challenged and I wouldn't be able to work with those people.

(01:01:17):
But yeah, Parker is incredibly strongly opinionated, but he's also incredibly informed, which makes for some really, really great debates. And I've just found that whatever, and it's not even CEO, but whatever a manager's idiosyncrasies are, you have to find a way to work with those. And I think that adaptability, like I'm just sort of, I like being a moldable puzzle piece where I can just fit in. I think that's actually one of my core skills. And so that's worked out for me and Parker and I before I started developing a deep foundation of respect, which is extremely important to building that. And over the years it's just gotten deeper and deeper and we don't always agree, but when we can have a totally reasonable discussion about it, and that's what makes it fun.

Lenny (01:02:06):
Adaptability actually is, I took a strength finder test once of finding my own strengths and that was my number one strength is I'm [inaudible 01:02:14] I think we share that.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:15):
That's excellent.

Lenny (01:02:15):
Yeah, seems like an important attribute for being in a place in. Well with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you if you're ready.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:25):
All right, I'm ready. Hit me.

Lenny (01:02:27):
Here we go. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:02:31):
Well, first is my favorite series of books ever, which is the Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson. It's a nine-volume epic or three-volume, nine-book epic depending on how you want to look at it. But it's about the time just before and into the enlightenment, historical fiction, a lot of fun. And I also love the Culture series by Iain Banks, which is just super fun, far-future sort of universe that I've really enjoyed.

Lenny (01:02:59):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:01):
Watched The Last of Us, was an avid fan of the game and I thought they did a really nice adaptation. Favorite mov, like I guess, recent movie, it's not that recent, but I really like Tenet, which I thought was a, I was impressed with their ability to go there and make that movie and I just really enjoyed it end to end.

Lenny (01:03:23):
It kind of ended, but we had a drinking game anytime someone mentioned Last of Us, which took over White Lotus. I'm going to drink some tea right here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:30):
Okay, fair enough. I'll try. I've only got water normally I got tea, but water today.

Lenny (01:03:33):
That works. But it's interesting, it hasn't come up often, so I think maybe we end that for now and see what the new pattern emerges. And then Tenant feels like, I was just thinking it feels like a compound movie, compound startup as a movie, a movie is very complicated too to stay-

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:50):
Yeah, That's why I enjoyed it. I like trying to figure out the multi-timeline chart in my head as the movie progressed.

Lenny (01:03:56):
The puzzle piece within you trying to find all the puzzle pieces.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:03:59):
Yeah, for sure.

Lenny (01:04:00):
What is a favorite interview question you like to ask? You already maybe answered this, but anything else come to mind?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:06):
I think I did, no, my favorite one is What questions do you have for me by far?

Lenny (01:04:09):
Great. What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you love?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:14):
I guess I'll just mention, I don't know if I go as far as I call these favorite products, but there's two that come to mind. My wife's computer broke the other day and I realized it was the CPU cooler that went bad and the Corsair H60 CPU cooler was super easy to use and really adaptable to lots of motherboards. I thought that was great. My other favorite product is the one I'm wearing in my ears right now, which my first pair of nice headphones I ever bought died late last week, and had to do some really quick research into my new favorite pair of headphones. And these Focal Bathys are super nice. I'm a bit of an audio file. I like to listen to classical music and ambient stuff, so we need a lot of dynamic range and noise cancellation and these have been great so far.

Lenny (01:04:57):
Okay, so what are they called?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:04:59):
Focal, I think it's Bathys, B-A-T-H-Y-S. Okay.

Lenny (01:05:04):
And has there a specific model or there's like that one?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:06):
That's it.

Lenny (01:05:06):
Okay.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:07):
You'll know it when you see it.

Lenny (01:05:09):
Okay. We will link to them in show notes, so maybe I'll get one. What's something relatively minor you've changed in the way that you built product that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:20):
Maybe the most recent innovation sort of at Rippling was the kind of introduction of what I'm calling imperatives. These things that whether they come bottom up or top down are things that like everybody across the entire product and engineering team needs to do and what's important about that list of things that are not on it. And in a world where we could choose to do hundreds of things at once, being able to force rank that list of things, draw a line, say these are the ones everyone has to do, has created a lot more focus and clarity than we had before.

Lenny (01:05:48):
So imperatives are essentially here's the priorities for the next, say quarter six months here?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:05:53):
Here are the priorities for everybody and now integrate that into your own team's priorities, right? So each team still is building their own priorities, but they have to factor in this set.

Lenny (01:06:05):
How many of those do you usually have? This is awesome. I like this tip.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:09):
It depends on what level of granularity you want to talk about them at, like maybe 10, right? It's a lot. We're going through between globalization and large improvements of the platform and a bunch of other large companies. All these things, it creates a bunch of things that just have to be cross-team simultaneously. I think it's pretty natural part of a company's evolution and we're just in that part of the cycle, so-

Lenny (01:06:33):
Awesome.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:33):
... used it.

Lenny (01:06:34):
Final question, what's a question I should have asked you that I didn't ask you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:38):
I guess, what do I do with my kids maybe? I have two kids, they're nine and-

Lenny (01:06:38):
What do you do with your kids?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:06:43):
... six. What do I do with my kids? My son, I'm a big board gamer and while I didn't push it on him, my son, he will play board games morning to night. And so we play a lot of European strategy games together and my daughter's now getting old enough that she's getting into them too. And so we just finished as a family playing Pandemic Legacy and the reward tomorrow night as we get to start playing Gloomhaven. So that's going to be fun.

Lenny (01:07:12):
I don't know either game, sounds very hard and complicated.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:15):
They're fun. They're fun.

Lenny (01:07:17):
Amazing. Jeremy, we covered a lot of topics. I feel like this is a compound podcast episode and so thank you for spending time with me. Thanks for being here. Two final questions, working folks, finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:32):
Awesome. LinkedIn is the easiest way online and if what I've been talking about today sounds interesting to you, we're definitely hiring like senior entrepreneurial PMs. And so if those leadership principles on our website look interesting, I'd love to hear from you.

Lenny (01:07:46):
What's the best way to explore those roles and apply? The

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:49):
The website has by far the best channel. It gets to this right recruiter who will tell me about it right away.

Lenny (01:07:55):
Great, surfline.com and there's probably a site for careers.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:07:58):
There is a career site on there that you, pretty easy to find.

Lenny (01:08:00):
Okay. Rolling to that in the show notes. Jeremy, thank you again for being here.

Jeremy Henrickson (01:08:04):
Thanks so much for having me. This was a lot of fun.

# Building a world-class data org | Jessica Lachs (VP of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
So you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:05):
For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function, not just answering the why, but answering the, "What do we do now that we know this?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):
One of your colleagues told me that you are incredibly good at defining metrics.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:19):
Retention is a terrible thing to goal on. It's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in a short term. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):
You mentioned the early team. I felt extreme ownership.

Jessica Lachs (00:00:34):
Yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening. And if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do to roll up your sleeves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):
Today my guest is Jessica Lachs. Jessica is Vice President of Analytics and Data Science at DoorDash, which has built one of the biggest and most impactful data teams in tech. She's been at DoorDash for over 10 years and was the first GM at DoorDash responsible for launching new markets. Previously, Jessica founded GiftSimple, a social gifting startup and began her career in investment banking at Lehman Brothers.

(00:01:11):
In our conversation, we go deep on how to build and scale your data org, including why a centralized org model is so effective. What to look for when hiring data people, how to pick the right metrics for teams to align incentives and drive the right sorts of outcomes. Examples of how the data team at DoorDash has helped the business make better decisions, a bunch of great stories about the early days of DoorDash and a ton more.

With that, I bring you Jessica Lachs. Jessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jessica Lachs (00:01:55):
Thank you so much for having me. I'm very excited to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:58):
So you've built one of the largest and most respected data teams in all of tech. I've heard from a number of people that look to you for advice when they're trying to build and scale their data teams. And then DoorDash in particular is an incredibly complex business. There's three or maybe even four sites to the marketplace. There's this operational element. From the outside, it just feels extremely complicated and wild. I imagine from the inside it's even more wild. Let's talk about some of the things you've learned about building and scaling the team. You have a fairly contrarian perspective on how to structure data teams. This was referenced when we had Elizabeth Stone on the podcast too. She approaches data the same way. So I'd love to hear just your take on how to structure data teams within companies.

(00:02:42):
 This episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's business 101. But here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual-first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize webpages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO, and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at webflow.com.

(00:03:30):
This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive, and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.

(00:04:04):
Most product managers will tell you, "Paperwork sucks." Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style, and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag-and-drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy-to-understand documentation.

Jessica Lachs (00:04:59):
There's two main things that I think are important when you're structuring a team. The first is I believe that analytics should have a seat at the table just like engineering and product and the business folks, the operators. For me, analytics is a business impact driving function and not purely a service function. I think there are analytics teams at other companies where they are answering people's questions, maybe even through Jira tickets, we're building dashboards. That was never really of interest to me. That wasn't the team that I wanted to build.

(00:05:35):
For me, it's about finding opportunities, about having a point of view on the decisions that we should make, not just answering the why but answering the so what. "So what do we do now that we know this?" And so that's definitely one thing as far as my point of view on building a data team. I think the second thing which may be a little more contrarian is I think there are people out there who think that analytics should be embedded into business units. I strongly disagree. I believe a central model, a center of excellence is superior and I'm happy to talk about why, but that's something that I feel quite strongly about. We've tried it or I shouldn't... well, we've experimented in the past with the alternative, so putting it into a business unit and it's just much more problematic and I think the value you get from a central model is far greater than some of the things that you might lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):
Yeah, let's definitely talk about it. And just to make sure people understand, when you say central versus embedded, is that in terms of reporting lines, in terms of their goals?

Jessica Lachs (00:06:44):
It's a great question. So mostly it's in terms of reporting lines because I think on the goal side, that is something where we have the same goals that our partner teams have, and I think that that's actually an important part of a successful central model. So when I say central model, it just means that for marketing analytics, marketing analytics is part of the broader analytics team. It does not sit and report in through marketing. Just to clarify.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:13):
Got it. So the reporting functions at some companies, there's the head of marketing or some partners to the head of marketing where the data, say, analyst or biz ops people or data scientists would report potentially to them and that's it. And they're not as connected to the core, to the rest of the data team, the rest of the analytics team versus-

Jessica Lachs (00:07:30):
Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):
Yeah.

Jessica Lachs (00:07:31):
So you'd have a bunch of smaller, of course, data teams that sit embedded within the functions. And I understand why business leaders like that. You're embedded within the function, so you're a part of the team. That ownership, that camaraderie that comes with that, I think you can solve for that. But I do understand that that is a benefit. I think the other benefit of course is the business leaders control the roadmaps so they get to dictate the work. They know that they have help and resources in that area when they need them. So that certainty, that control, I totally understand the value there, but I think that those are two things that you can solve for if you know that those are the biggest issues with a central team. So for us, we have a central analytics team, but we are divided up into pods that map perfectly with how product engineering, operations marketing are structured as well.

(00:08:33):
And so our team de facto has these folks embedded with our partner teams, even though the reporting structure is up through a central org through me. And that helps the team to feel like they are one team, both in terms of the analytics team feeling like it's one team, but also to use the marketing example, the marketing folks are one team and because the analytics shares the same goals as the marketing leaders, your incentives are aligned to work on the most important things and your success is their success and vice versa. So I think that that's been really a happy medium, but still preserves all the benefits of a central org. And there are a lot of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:23):
I want to hear about them, but I think something that some people may think when you say essential org is like a silo data team that sits there and they're like a service org a little bit within the company. It's like, "Hey, I need some data help." And you try to convince that, "Hey, I need some help on this thing." And that's not what you're saying.

Jessica Lachs (00:09:41):
Oh, no. No, no, no. That job seems terrible. I don't want that job. No, to the earlier point, we have a seat at the table. We are business partners, we are thought partners with our product counterparts, with our engineering counterparts, with our ops counterparts, and we again, share the same goals and have the same initiatives that they do. And it's just our job to come at it from a data-driven place. We bring to the table insights on things that we've noticed, deep dives that we do to understand the problems that we're trying to solve better. If we need to grow, what are the most efficient ways to grow? What are the trade-offs that we have to make? Where are their pockets of opportunity? That is what I expect my team to be able to bring to that table, the proverbial table, that we want to see that. And in order to earn their spot, that's the deal. We get the seat at the table and we need to earn it by bringing opportunities that we all can go and go after.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:52):
Awesome. So in a sense, it is embedded. They're embedded in cross-functional teams across the org, but they report up to essential org to you essentially in the end?

Jessica Lachs (00:11:01):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):
Cool. What are some of the benefits of this approach?

Jessica Lachs (00:11:05):
Oh, there's so many. Okay, so the first thing is a consistent and high talent bar. I think this is something I saw when we would have some pockets of analytics folks embedded is having a consistent bar for talent in terms of what we're looking for, what are the technical skills, what are the soft skills? And being able to evaluate candidates with that same bar, using our same rubric. You just get more consistent and higher talent in my opinion. I think that's number one. Number two is actually growth opportunities. So if you're siloed, you may be the most senior data person within... I keep picking on marketing. But you might be the most senior data scientist within marketing. Where do you go from there? I think when you have the central org, you're able to see if there are growth opportunities in other areas within the company.

(00:12:04):
And so that really helps folks to stay engaged because they can look at new problems if the problems they've been working on for several years are getting maybe boring and they want something new, there's an opportunity, move from marketing over to merchant analytics. And then I think similarly, if there isn't a promotion or room to grow, if you want to be a people manager and there just isn't a people management role within your functional area, well, you've got 10 other ones to look at and maybe there is that opportunity. So I think it helps with the growth opportunities for the team, which helps to retain talent. So that's a second thing. The third thing is just consistency of methodologies and metrics. So you don't have sales that was as defined by one team and sales as defined by another team. You just have sales and everybody is using the same metrics, the same methodologies, and you're able to improve your methodologies with input from more people.

(00:13:10):
And rather than recreating the wheel, building the same churn prediction model on six different teams. You can instead build one and have the input of six different teams. I think that's definitely another benefit. Also helps you just scale because you start to see the same problems across teams and so you're like, "Ooh, this is an issue that we need to get ahead of. This is something we need to automate," or, "This is something that we need to improve upon," or, "a problem that is going to grow as our business, as our teams scales." So I think it helps you see around corners a little bit more.

(00:13:45):
And then just lastly, there's a team culture brand. I think that's really important, not just externally for recruiting top talent, but the team is really proud to be members of the analytics team. We have a unique culture of learning, of sharing. You have someone you can go to talk about your challenges. You have someone who can peer review your work. I think just having that team culture that we have is really important. And it's a lot harder to get when you have the individual silos, particularly in an earlier stage when it's a smaller team, you just don't have as many people around. Everybody wants to have friends at work and we're creating an environment where they can find like-minded data nerds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:33):
It makes me think about Airbnb's first data team. I don't know if you know Riley Newman well, but he built Airbnb's first data team and it was actually an analytics team. They called themselves the 'A-Team' on the point of culture, and that always felt a lot of fun and they loved being part of that team.

Jessica Lachs (00:14:49):
Yeah. We have the same, but now I feel a lot less special for coming up with that name.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):
Oh, you called it A-Team also?

Jessica Lachs (00:14:56):
Yeah, we got the A-Team, yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
And then I think they moved away from it when there was a push. Now we're data scientists, we're not analytics or analysts. And that was like, I don't know, 10 year ago, like [inaudible 00:15:08] data science. We're data scientists.

Jessica Lachs (00:15:09):
We'll always be the A-Team.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):
There's so many threads I want to follow here, one that's a tangent, but something that I think a lot of people struggle with is you talked about how you want your data team, your analytics team to be proactive, to find opportunities, to give you ideas, to help you figure out what to build, not just answer questions. At the same time, there are many questions that teams need to get answered. Do you have any advice for just how to set up a team where they both find time to explore, dig, show opportunities and come up with big ideas and also, "Hey, we just need to figure out the funnel conversion on this thing," or "Hey, what do you think? What's happening in China right now?" Thoughts there?

Jessica Lachs (00:15:47):
Yeah, such a good question. I think it's something that never gets easier. You have to be very intentional to carve out time for exploratory work for deep dives because as you mentioned, there are always more questions and more work to be done than hours in the day. And so I think being intentional about it and setting goals for your team around finding these insights through self-directed work is an important mechanism for holding ourselves accountable to that goal because it tends to be the first thing that goes when you get a lot of inbounds, you're like, "All right, well, let's deep dive on something that I don't know if it's really something. It could be high ROI, it could be low ROI, I don't know." So the expected value is lower than this known thing that I can deliver and make someone happy.

(00:16:42):
So I think to prevent that time from just slipping away, you really have to be intentional. We would do hackathons for our team to carve out days to just go and look into these really interesting things and find opportunities. And I think we have the support of our business partners because so many great insights have come from these deep dives and it really has been some of the work that drives future roadmaps. So they're always really great at allowing us to have this time and actually encourage us often to have this time for some self-directed work, to go find the next big opportunity.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:23):
If there's no answer that comes to mind, that's totally cool. But is there an example of one of these insights that someone on the data team came up with that led to something big for DoorDash that you're able to share?

Jessica Lachs (00:17:35):
So one interesting example was from a hackathon we did a couple of years ago where we were looking at referral as a channel for consumer acquisition. And when you compare that channel to others, it was below average in terms of the engagement you'd see from consumers who came through that channel and the payback period. And rather than just lowering spend on referrals and moving right along, we really wanted to understand what was happening. And so during the hackathon, we did a deep dive into referral. We actually tried referring each other. We tried committing referral fraud, creating new accounts to get around rules. And we uncovered a lot of fraudulent behavior through this deep dive. We ordered so many cupcakes to the office. I remember using referral credits because you had to place an order to be able to get the referral bonus. So we would create the account, place the orders, and we just kept ordering cupcakes.

(00:18:39):
And what we noticed was that referral as a channel was a bit misleading when you would look at the average in terms of payback and that it was really a bimodal distribution and you had one group of really great consumers who were referring other really great consumers, and the payback on those consumers was really strong. In fact, if that's all you saw, you would spend a lot more on that channel.

(00:19:08):
And then what was happening was you had this other group of consumers that were not as good people who were posting referral codes online and getting people who were just in it to get free discounts and credits. And we had at that point in time, pretty lax fraud rules. And we didn't have caps on these things. All of which came about from this deep dive where we found that this group of consumers was really a drag on the efficiency of this marketing channel. And so I think that's an example of a few things that we like to do at DoorDash. One being these deep dives and taking the time to really understand the problem and then ultimately make a bunch of recommendations for what we should do, including better fraud checks, caps on referrals, et cetera, et cetera. But also how the average can be incredibly misleading. And so looking at distributions and trying to break down what you're seeing to find ways that you can optimize in ways that you can gain in efficiencies.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):
That's an awesome story, great memory to come up with that one. So this is a really good example of a way to carve out time for the data team to think long-term, think look for opportunities, find big ideas. So the hackathon is one idea. Imagine many data people are struggling often to push back on asks that are just like, "h, we need to know. We just need this one thing. Here's a question, just answer this one question part." Do you have any advice to data to get better at pushing back? Sounds like a bit of cultural like, "We have time, we need to work on these bigger things." But just any advice for data leaders or data ICs to find time for these sorts of things?

Jessica Lachs (00:20:59):
Yeah, saying no to someone is never fun. I think as a self-proclaimed people-pleaser, you don't want to say no, especially when it's something you can do and you know that you can very easily with maybe an hour's work, make someone happy. I think it's really important to establish a culture and for leadership to really establish the rules of working and that operating model so that some of the junior folks aren't forced to always have to say no. And I think one of the ways we do that is through our goaling. So because our goals are the same as our business partners, we're able to pretty easily say, "Hey, we've got a limited amount of time. These are our goals. What are the most important things that we are going to work on this week or this month in order for both of us to hit our goals?"

(00:21:49):
And so when something comes up to be able to say, "Hey, this data poll that you want me to do, is this more important than these other three things that I was going to be working on? Yes or no?" And I think sometimes people don't necessarily realize the trade-offs, and when you make them apparent and you put them front and center, they realize that, "Oh, actually, you know what? That asset's not important. That can wait." So I think that that's definitely something I would recommend, which is always share the trade-offs. Don't suffer in silence with, "How am I going to do all four of these things?" Bring it up and say, "Hey, this is what I was planning to do. If you want me to do this extra new thing, then one of these other things is going to have to drop.

(00:22:36):
I personally don't think that your ask is more important than these three things, but maybe there's new information, maybe there's context I don't have, so let's talk about it." Rather than just being like, "No, I won't do that." That's not a great approach either. I think having the conversation and constantly reevaluating your prioritization to make sure you're working on the most important things or your team is working on the most important things is really good hygiene to have with your business partner. So some teams do that through a weekly standup like, "Here's what we're going to do this week. Do we like this prioritization? Do we not?" Some folks do it less formally than that. I think you got to figure out what works for you. But to the earlier point, it's a conversation with your engineering partner, your product partner, your ops partner, you're all on the same team, you're all trying to achieve the same goals and you're all incentivized to have your analytics team working on the most impactful things.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:32):
This advice is great for any role basically. And if I were to summarize it to a couple words, it's just prioritize and communicate what your priorities are and then align on the trade-offs of shifting your priorities.

Jessica Lachs (00:23:45):
Every once in a while you just throw one over and say, "You know what? This is quick. I'll do it." At least I do. I think sometimes just knock it out, build some goodwill. I think that that's also important. But usually it's not something you can do in five minutes and in that case it's that ruthless prioritization for sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
And then there's also the side that you talked about of just show that you can provide value doing these things that are longer term, like prove your worth. "Hey, look at all these opportunities I found for our team over time, I should keep spending time on these other areas," versus the on fire stuff.

Jessica Lachs (00:24:18):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:19):
When you're hiring people for your team, I'm curious what you look for and you think is incredibly important that maybe other people aren't prioritizing as much. What do you focus on when you're hiring?

Jessica Lachs (00:24:31):
Yeah. So everybody needs to have a certain set of technical skills. I think that's a non-starter. We have a technical bar, we do a technical screen. So I think that's table stakes. There's some really unique characteristics that I've noticed when I look at some of the top talent that I've had on the team or have on the team. I think the first thing is just curiosity. You can't teach curiosity, or at least I haven't found a way to do it. If somebody else knows how, please let me know. Somebody who is just self-motivated to pull on the threads when they find them. So they don't just answer a question. They're like, "Hmm, this thing seems a little odd. I'm going to dig in and look. Even though I could say I'm done, I answered the question, I did the thing I was going to do." The person that has that curiosity, something seems off, something doesn't really make sense and goes and proactively looks into what that is. That is just so valuable. So I really look for that curiosity and that self-motivation to do it without being told.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:39):
How do you test for that? How do you do that in an interview and get a sense of if they're good at that?

Jessica Lachs (00:25:43):
One way you can do it through the questions you ask is have something that is not quite right within the case that you're presenting and see if people notice first and foremost. And even if they don't, if you point it out like, "Where do they go with that?" I think that that's something that you can test for. I think you can also ask for examples that for these folks typically will highlight this, they'll talk about, "I noticed this thing, and so we decided to investigate." So I think that there are ways that you can get that signal through the interview process, but it's really hard. I think testing for hard skills is a lot easier than testing for soft skills. And I think in some of the questions we ask, we'll ask a question with the idea that we're assessing something separate than what the question is necessarily asking. And I think that this is one example of where that really works.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:47):
You said that you give them a case. What does that look like? What is the actual approach to how you do this interview?

Jessica Lachs (00:26:52):
Our interview process has in the early stages a coding exercise. So we do our technical screen and a shortened version of a business case. So real world problem solving. Typically, it's something actually from DoorDash history, like a real problem that we had to see how people can problem solve on the fly. I think that that's an important skill to be able to have, which is, how do you take a problem, break it down, talk through it. A little bit like some of those consulting cases that you hear about, but something that's really rooted in real problems. And I think you can learn a lot from those types of cases where, yes, you get to see how people handle ambiguity and structured problem solving, but ultimately most people get something wrong. They make an assumption that's wrong because well, I would hope that the interviewer knows the business better than the interviewee.

(00:27:56):
And seeing how people react to being told they're wrong is a really important signal in my opinion. Seeing how people respond, how they're able to take new information and pivot, how they're able to make a decision. So that's another thing that I like to see in cases where, hey, you may not know the real right decision. You might say, "Hey, I could see it going one way, I could see it going the other way." But I always push people to say, "If you had to make a call right now, what would it be?" So are people able to have a point of view without full information because that's life. Sometimes you have to just pick a direction and make a decision even though you don't have perfect information. So I like to see some of these softer skills and how they manifest throughout a case interview, even if it's not specifically what I'm asking with the literal problem we're solving in the case.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:57):
Along these lines, but in a different direction. You don't actually have a deep data science data background before you got into this stuff. I know you had some art background, you had an art portfolio back in school, and I think a lot of people wouldn't imagine that for someone being head of analytics for a company like DoorDash. I don't exactly know the question, but I guess is there anything there that you think would be interesting for people to know or hear?

Jessica Lachs (00:29:24):
Yeah, it's funny. I joke that I have a job I'd never be hired for because I don't have a traditional data science background. And I know that Elizabeth Stone on her podcast with you talked a lot about her non-traditional background for a CTO. So hey, maybe there's something to it. But I became a data scientist out of necessity. I completely self-taught in terms of SQL and Python and I did it because there was a need at DoorDash for someone to help figure out what the right goals were, how we set those goals, how we were performing different markets early in the DoorDash story, so 10 years ago at this point. And I think I just gravitated towards that type of work and Tony recognized that superpower in me even though I don't have that formal training. So yeah, I'm a bit of an artist for fun, but I guess a data scientist in practice or for career.

(00:30:31):
But I think that that non-traditional background has been a great thing because I'm able to hire people who have the technical skills that I don't have, the folks with PhDs in statistics and the data scientists, machine learning and otherwise. I am able to hire those folks and yet keep them really focused on driving business impact because my background was on the finance side, and so I've always been a pragmatist. And for me, the purpose of our team is to drive business impact. And so the mix between the technical skills of the smarter people that I've hired, the smarter than myself, and my grounding in driving business impact has been a really great partnership.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:21):
That's quite an inspiring story for someone that is just starting out and doesn't necessarily have a lot of experience in data, but also just generally. I think this is a really cool example. You could be successful in a field that you don't have a ton of background in. I'm curious what you think it was in you that allowed you to succeed in this and get to where you are today. What do you think you did right or what is some habits or ways of thinking that you think helped you achieve that?

Jessica Lachs (00:31:52):
First off, I have imposter syndrome like everybody else. So it's not like I have this crazy sense of confidence of like, "Oh, I can do anything." I definitely have the same doubts that others have. I think part of it was probably not even realizing what I was doing. When you're at a startup and things are moving quickly and you see a problem, and I've always liked solving problems, so I was like, "All right, how do I solve this problem?" It was like, "Oh, well, I need access to the data. I don't have access to the data. All right, I'll ask an engineer to get me the data. Well, this isn't going to scale. I can't always bother an engineer, so how do I figure out how to get the data myself? Well, let's learn Python." So I think it happened organically and I don't think I realized at the time what I was even doing.

(00:32:41):
And then I think if you think about things from first principles about what you need right now in front of you to unblock yourself or solve a problem, and you just focus on that instead of thinking about a global org that you're trying to build. I think that that helps. So for me, it was always about solving the problem in front of me the best way I could. And if that meant I needed to hire an engineer to report into me through the finance org, then that was what we were going to do and nobody was going to tell me I couldn't do it. So I think it's a belief in yourself, and ultimately it's just my desire to solve problems and figure out what has to get done is, I think, ultimately how it came about.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:30):
I love that so much. There's so many elements there that I think a lot of people can learn from. I feel like there's also this underlying current of you're just motivated for this to work. You wanted DoorDash to succeed, and you're just like, "I will do what I need to do to make this happen. I need to solve these problems. I'm not going to overthink. Do I have the skills necessarily to do these things [inaudible 00:33:48]?"

Jessica Lachs (00:33:48):
Yeah, I think I'm competitive. I think that's a trait that you find in a lot of early DoorDash folks and current DoorDash folks, to be honest, just wanting to win and being willing to do whatever you need to win. So roll up your sleeves, do something that's not your job. I think back to early days of taking out the garbage on Saturday nights because it needed to get done. I think that that was something that is ingrained in our culture from Tony Xu, from our founder and CEO, and I think that really resonated with me, and I feel like I've always operated that way as well. And I think that that helped me in my career to be able to do what I've done without really thinking about it too much.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:40):
Are there any other memories or stories of the early days of DoorDash that would be fun to share? Something that sticks with you of like, "Wow, I can't believe that's what it was like?"

Jessica Lachs (00:34:49):
Oh man, there's so many, including so many mistakes that we've made. But I think something that really stands out to me is before I moved to the analytics area, I was actually a GM. I was the first GM at DoorDash and I was in Boston in 2014 launching the city of Boston when nobody knew who we were. And we would wake up early in the morning, 5 A.M. and we would go out, it was the winter of 2014. We'd go out and we'd hand out promo codes consumers outside of the [inaudible 00:35:30] in Boston, and these promo cards would be attached to kind bars so people would take them. And the whole team, it was a small team, there were four of us, but the whole team would go out in the morning to do this. And I think back to our sales guy, shout out to Joey G. So Joe Graccio is our sales guy in Boston-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):
[inaudible 00:35:47] Joey G.

Jessica Lachs (00:35:51):
And he was gold on signing merchants on the platform.

(00:35:55):
That was how he was gold. His compensation was tied to that. And yet in the morning when we would go out, he was with us handing out promo codes because he was part of the team because he wanted to win. We wanted to grow the business. And I think that that is just a great example of the culture that Tony and the early employees and Stanley and Andy, other co-founders really instilled in all of us early in those days. So I think that that ownership, that extreme ownership of the outcome is definitely one of the things.

(00:36:32):
I think the other is just being very customer first. And I say customer, I mean consumers, dashers and merchants as all being our customers. And the first time I ever went to the office headquarters in Palo Alto, which at the time was in an animal hospital. The first time I went there, there was a huge site outage and the whole company, it was like 20 people at the time, the whole company jumped online to do customer support, to answer the phones, to make sure that folks were getting refunds for orders that weren't going through, make sure the orders that were out there were getting delivered, just dropped everything and hopped on to do support.

(00:37:15):
And I was brand new, didn't really know how to use the tools, and so it was like, "How can I be useful?" And so back in those days, we used to order dinner to the office using DoorDash. And so in order to preserve about three dashers who would've had to deliver food to us, I was like, "I'm going to go out, go out dashing, go get everyone pizza so that we could feed the masses doing credits and refunds and do what we had to to make sure that we were serving our customers well." And I think that night was one of the largest refunds as a percent of our bank account that we had ever given out. And I think Tony, there were two examples that he's talked about where we just gave a lot of money back to customers because it was the right thing to do because our service failed and we wanted to do right by them.

(00:38:06):
So I think that those are two stories that stick out in my mind and really highlight culturally what makes DoorDash unique and what I think has been a really important part of our success.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):
It reminds me of the story that Tony and all the early employees, and I imagine you did this just like, "We're dashers," it's like a rotation where you dash for a while. Is that part of the culture?

Jessica Lachs (00:38:32):
Yeah, so we have a program, a WeDash program, and Keith Yandell, who's our chief business officer, did your podcast last year and he talked about this. But four times a year all the employees go out and go dashing or do customer support, and it's part of our culture that I love. I actually go pair dashing, so I go together with one of my colleagues. We've done it for years now, and it's a fun thing that we do together four times a year. Actually, usually more than that. And it's important because you get to use the product, you build empathy with all the audiences. I think all of us order DoorDash a lot, so we've built empathy with consumers. But being able to go and understand what it's like to go out dashing and when you're in the restaurant going and talking with merchants and seeing the experience from their point of view, I think it's just incredibly important. And of course we find a lot of bugs like, "Hmm, this doesn't work the way it should, let me report this." So I think it's also just great for catching bugs in the product.

(00:40:39):
I want to come back to a thread, something you mentioned where you and a lot of the early team had felt extreme ownership over the company and that's why a lot of this stuff happened. For people, every founder, every product team, they're going to like, "Yes, we need that. Let's make sure everyone on the team feels extreme ownership." Is there anything that you think that the early team did to create that or is it hiring, just pick people that will have that feeling already, or is cultural?

Jessica Lachs (00:41:05):
I think it's both. It's definitely cultural. I think it comes from the top and I think that Tony exhibits this extreme ownership and looks for it in others. So I think that helps. But I think even today I expect of my team that same extreme ownership over the outcomes. And so I'm more interested in our team figuring out how to solve a problem than the box that someone fits in like, "I'm a data scientist and so I only do these things." Right? It's like, "No. I mean, yes, you are a data scientist, but your goal is to figure out what's happening, and if that means that you're going to pick up the phone and call customers, then that is what you're going to do." And I think that expecting that and setting that as the norm for the team, this ownership of the outcome is something that we continue to do at DoorDash and instill in everyone whether you were early or just joined last month.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:09):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind of someone practicing extreme ownership, like a data scientist calling someone or something along those lines?

Jessica Lachs (00:42:16):
Yeah, so I actually had a meeting yesterday morning with the team that's working on some of our affordability initiatives and we had shipped something that we expected to work, and it didn't. And instead of, "You can dig into the data," to understand the segments of consumers that you would expect it to work with and those that it wouldn't, of course we did that. But ultimately it was like, "I don't know why." And that's where qualitative research is superior to quantitative research, it's asking for the context, to actually talking to people to figure out what was the motivation, what worked, what didn't for them. And so the team, data scientists included, just sat and made phone calls. And so they were talking about what they found from those phone calls and that's going to inform future decisions. And I think rather than saying, "Well, that's what the qualitative research team is supposed to do," it's like, "No, no, no, that is what our team, anyone's team is supposed to do because that's what's needed to unblock us from this next test that we want to run because we need to know what we are testing."

(00:43:23):
So I think that it happens every day. I think I really love when I see team members go outside the traditional bounds of what a data science role might be and do some product management work, do some engineering work. I think that that's part of what keeps the job interesting. I think it's part of what makes our team special is that that is not only allowed, it's encouraged, and probably also a reason why we've had folks who've gone from my team to the product org and to the ops org and to the finance org is because they get to do and experience parts of that job and get a good sense for what that's like and then realize it's something that they love. So I think it's definitely something we encourage at DoorDash.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):
I love that. I want to move in a slightly different direction. One of your colleagues told me that you are incredibly good at defining metrics, which is so important to get right for a business, especially when it's complex at DoorDash. And I hear you're especially good at finding the right metric to drive the right incentive, especially when the business is really messy and things like that. So I'm just curious what you've learned about how to pick good metrics and align incentives well.

Jessica Lachs (00:44:45):
I've learned a lot of things about metrics, mostly from bad metrics. I actually think you learn a lot from picking the wrong metric. Ultimately, you want to find a short-term metric you can measure that drives a long-term output. So people always talk about, "Oh, we want to drive an improvement in retention." Retention is a terrible thing to goal on because it's almost impossible to drive in a meaningful way in the short term, and yet you want to be able to experiment and iterate quickly. So what are the things that drive retention? What are the inputs? So I think it's really important to find the right inputs, and then through experimentation test whether or not those short-term inputs are driving the long-term output that you're looking for. I think that's one thing. I think keeping things simple is another thing I've learned over the years, maybe it's data scientists, but they tend to love these composite metrics with a coefficient.

(00:45:44):
"We're going to wait this input at X and this input at X+2." And then you end up with a metric that nobody really understands that doesn't actually mean anything. And you're like, "I don't know if a 0.1 increase is it a lot? Is it good? Is it bad?" So they're just hard to work with.

(00:46:07):
And so I always encourage folks, just pick something simple, even if it's not perfect and your composite would be more perfect. If people understand it, if they have an intuition around it, if it's something that people can talk about across the company, it's going to be a much better metric in terms of driving real outcomes than your made up composite score that nobody understands. So I think keeping things simple is also really important. And then I think the last thing I'll say is it's important to understand how metrics across the company equate to one another.

(00:46:43):
And so we spend a lot of time quantifying things in terms of a common currency. So for example, if I were to lower price by a dollar, what would I get in terms of, we'll say, volume? Well, what if I lowered delivery times by a minute? What do I get for that in terms of volume? And so now you can make trade-offs between maybe your marketing team and your logistics team because you have this common currency that everyone can talk about. And so we've done that. We've tried to quantify all of the levers of our business, price, selection, quality in common terms, so that if we have, say, a dollar to spend, we know what we get depending on where we put it, over what timeframe. I think that that helps us make decisions more quickly because we know what our options are. We know we have our inventory of things that we can do, short-term, long-term, and what we get for it. So it definitely helps us to make decisions more quickly and hopefully better decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
These are so awesome. I definitely want to follow up on some of this. This is so good. So maybe on this last one, which we did at Airbnb also like, how does everything translate into Knight's book and booking? Every decision we make, what is the actual Knight's book impact? And so I imagine in your case, I don't know if you want to talk about these things. I imagine it's transactions, or purchases, or GMB or something like that, so I'm guessing is the final metric. I don't know. Is that something you talk about or you don't talk about that?

Jessica Lachs (00:48:26):
We measure things in terms of GOV, so Gross Order Value, and also volume.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):
Got it. [inaudible 00:48:34]. Okay, so basically every other metric that people are gold on as much as you can translate, there's a model that translates that into Gross Order Value and volume? Awesome. So when a team is saying, "Hey, we're going to change the onboarding flow and impact conversion here." I don't know. I guess what are some examples of other metrics on teams that potentially translate into GOV and volume just to make it even more real?

Jessica Lachs (00:49:01):
Yeah. So everything from the example that you started with, which is an improvement in the login flow, how many more consumers are getting onto the app and ultimately placing orders. And so you can translate that to, of course, orders and GOV. But then something as interesting as selling a Thai restaurant in Sacramento, we're able to say, "What do we think that that gets us in terms of GOV from the consumer by selling that Thai restaurant?" So it's every area of the business, it's mobilizing more dashers on the road. What does that do to our quality metrics in terms of delivery times? How does that translate? So because of that, we're able to figure out if we want to spend the dollar or spend the time, the team's time, on improving conversion or spending more money in marketing or onboarding more dashers or signing more restaurants or adding more grocery stores. So we are able to look across the whole business and figure out what is the right mix of actions to take to achieve our goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:18):
I could see as you talk about this why this is so important in a marketplace, especially a multi-sided marketplace where there's always trade-off decisions between supply investment and demand growth and dasher growth. I don't even know, my brain would explode trying to think about all these things, so I get exactly why this is so important to business. Okay. And then in terms of the simple recommendation, I think when people hear like, "Yeah, keep it simple," they're like, "Yeah, yeah, we're going to keep it simple." What are some things that point to, "This is not simple," that tell you like, "No, this is way too complicated. You should try to simplify this metric even though it's not ideal. It's not the perfect metric, but it needs to be simpler."

Jessica Lachs (00:50:56):
Yeah. So we had a score for merchant health, which we tried experimenting with, which was a combination of factors that we had found would lead to a merchant being on the platform and getting an order. So we wanted to make sure that the merchant had active hours on the platform and had images and had a full menu that was accurate and robust. A number of different inputs. And we created a composite that weighted all of these different inputs. And then we were like, "What is our merchant health score?" And you were like, "It's 0.35. It's not 35%. So what is that, that 0.35? I don't know what it is." So instead of that, we said, "What are the most important factors in order... First, let's measure how many of the new merchants are getting an order within their first, say, seven days on the platform.

(00:51:57):
And then let's look at how many of our merchants are doing these things we know are important. So these inputs. So let's goal our team on getting merchant photo coverage up. Let's goal the team on making sure that we have open hours, accurate hours." So yes, someone might say it's simpler to have a composite metric, but it was so hard to understand what it was and how to move it that it became meaningless. And ultimately moving to something that was simpler to understand, even if it meant having three metrics instead of one, it ultimately was better for the team because folks knew what they were trying to move. And so yeah, maybe we missed number four, five and six on the list of things, but you got one through three and that's 95% of it anyway. So once we get success with that 95, then let's talk about figuring out the other 5%.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:55):
It's so funny because this is exactly what we went through at Airbnb, we had, we call that a healthy host. I led the host quality team for a while and we came up with this healthy host metric that was six factors of a host, like the cancellation rate, the review rate, their response rate and things like that. And then we're just like, "Cool, let's move this, let make more hosts healthy." And then you end up like, "Okay, which one do we focus on?," And, "Oh, what about all these others?" And we ended up basically focusing on one at a time. And so let's just make that the goal for now and then rotate through the different biggest [inaudible 00:53:28] opportunities to move. [inaudible 00:53:30].

Jessica Lachs (00:53:30):
Exactly. I think in hindsight for the example you give, which of those six things are actually the most important? And if you're able to then quantify which one matters most, you work on that one first and you materially move that one and then you work on the next one. You want to move them all. But being able to prioritize and know what you're going to get for a 20% improvement in, say, your cancellation rate, that's where analytics I think can add a lot of value. Because yes, ultimately you'll get to all of them, but the way you do that and the time can have a meaningful impact on your growth. If you can target the most problematic things first and solve those, you get more bang for your buck and that compounds over time. And so doing the things that matter first and most quickly is a competitive advantage in my opinion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:21):
The other thing we found along those same lines is rotating between different metrics is so not efficient because you get good at, "We're going to move this metric." And your team's like, "Cool, we totally understand this lever," like cancellation rate. We become really smart at cancellation rate and then three months later, you need to switch to response rate and they have to learn a whole new paradigm of how to think about it. And it's just super inefficient. So we found basically, just keep a team on the metric until there's no more opportunities and give another team one of these other metrics.

Jessica Lachs (00:54:50):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):
So many lessons. Okay. And the first thing you said on how to pick a good metric about this idea of short-term metrics that have long-term impact. How did you phrase that again?

Jessica Lachs (00:55:02):
Yeah, so we find proxy metrics for long-term outcomes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:05):
Awesome. And it's similar to the simple metric, and it all comes down to, again, just like the metric should be something probably, you can move, you can understand, that's close enough to this ideal, perfect metric, but isn't necessarily the entire ideal. Okay, awesome. Anything else along these lines of just picking metrics, working with metrics that you've learned that would be worth [inaudible 00:55:28]?

Jessica Lachs (00:55:27):
With metrics, we are often looking at the average, and I think we talked about this a little bit earlier, but making sure that you're looking at the edge cases and your fail states is also really important. And so we often will set goals actually and create metrics around those edge cases. So like the disaster deliveries, the ones that go terribly wrong. So we have this concept of Never Delivered, which is orders that are never delivered. We're really great at naming things at DoorDash, and they're very rare. And so if you were just looking at the average effect or the average consumer experience, it would never come up. If you were just measuring quality based on average values of delivery times and lateness [inaudible 00:56:18], these wouldn't show up because they are so rare, but they're terrible. They're terrible experiences for consumers. They lead to churn.

(00:56:27):
They're incredibly expensive because you're refunding an order or repurchasing food and having to send another dasher to deliver that repurchased food. So they're very expensive, they're costly from a consumer experience standpoint. And I think if you're not looking for these fail states, they are often missed. So I think when you're picking metrics, yes, you want to improve engagement and you want to improve conversion, and there's a lot of things that are averages overall that you want to move, but it's so important to find these edge cases in these fail states and actually set concrete goals around eliminating them because it can be really powerful.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):
So the tip here is actually make that a goal like, never deliver at some team, just keep cutting that down?

Jessica Lachs (00:57:17):
Exactly. So we have part of our quality analytics team and we have product engineering and ops on it as well. Their goal is to eradicate Never Delivered. And in order to do that, you have to understand why they happen. Sometimes it's human error, sometimes it's fraud. And then figure out ways that you can prevent them, that you can fix them while it's happening and ultimately just get rid of them from the system. And you're never going to completely get rid of them, but you can make a meaningful impact to make them even more rare than a fraction of a percent.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:00):
Yeah. And I feel like people may be hearing this and like, "Of course, why would you not focus on terrible work experiences?" But I think in most companies, they look at the big numbers, they look at the averages as you said like, "Oh, it almost never happens. Why do we even spend any time on this?" And your point is, you should actually spend time on these really terrible experiences, even if it's a tiny portion of your business. I guess maybe share why that's important. Is it just because that has trickle-down effects on the brand?

Jessica Lachs (00:58:27):
Yeah, I think it's a couple of things. So just because something doesn't happen frequently doesn't mean that it's not important. So the Never Delivered example is a great one in that this is leading directly to churn and it's also costing a lot of money far more than its frequency would suggest. And I think the fact of the matter is is when you have things that cause churn, you're losing all of that consumer's subsequent orders, and that is not necessarily observed. You're just seeing one bad experience, you're not seeing all of the lost orders because they're lost. And so I think that sometimes this is an area where the data doesn't show you the full picture. And being able to quantify the impact on engagement, on profitability, will make it stand out as something that really, that you would maybe miss if you weren't really looking for it.

(00:59:25):
And then I think the other thing is with something like login errors, sometimes you don't see it in the data because people can't even get into the data. If you're not able to log in, you're not making any purchases, you're not ordering, and so you may not see it in the data that you're looking at. And so that's also something that I think is important for data folks to think about, which is what data don't we have? What data might we be missing? Where might there be opportunities and things that we actually need to identify and fix that we may not see? Because in this case, with login failures, they're not able to log in. They're not in the denominator, and so we're missing out on them from the data set entirely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):
Just a couple of more questions. There's one that I skipped that I'm just going to come back to. It's completely out of nowhere, but I think it might be interesting is about a global data org. So you run a global data org, you have data scientists and analysts and biz ops people all over the world, not just the US. I'm curious just how is it different managing data people in different countries versus just the US? What's a big difference?

Jessica Lachs (01:00:37):
Everyone always asks about the differences. What I am surprised by is how similar things are, how similar people are, the data scientists themselves, but also consumers and dashers and couriers, as we call them at Volt. There's a lot more similarities than differences. I do think that when you built a business in the US and then you introduce new countries, having different currencies and different languages adds complexity that you weren't necessarily familiar with. I think similarly in EU countries versus non-EU countries in Europe, there's different regulation. So that adds a fun layer of complexity. So I do think that it adds complexity to the problem set, but ultimately so many of the problems are the same. It feels a little bit like going into a test having seen the answer key. And so for me, there are problems we've encountered at Volt through Volt analytics where I'm like, "Oh, we've had a similar problem.

(01:01:49):
I have an instinct for what the answer might be. Let's still test because there could be differences cultural or otherwise, but I feel like I know where we're going to end." And then sometimes there are problems where it's new for one reason or another, and it's exciting because you're like, "All right, let's see if things are different here." Let's see what ideas might work in a Volt country that don't work in a DoorDash country and vice versa. So I think I tend to focus more on what's the same, and then I'm pleasantly surprised when I find things that are different because that keeps you on your toes and keeps things interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:31):
I'm going to take us to AI Corner. This is a segment we have in the podcast where I try to understand how people are using AI in their day-to-day and in their business. I'm curious if you've found some really interesting way of using AI ideally in... you can go in either one of these directions, and how you or your team work day-to-day using AI tools to make you more efficient, or integrating AI into your product, making DoorDash better.

Jessica Lachs (01:02:59):
Yeah, I think that there are opportunities in both. I think one of the things I'm really excited about is actually the former. So in helping to make the team more productive, we do something called Office Hours at DoorDash, the analytics team. And it's something that we started eight years ago, and it was a way to provide support for teams that at the time we just didn't have the bandwidth to support. So we would go, in the early days, we'd go sit in a room and we'd say, "Come on in and we'll help you with anything you need help with. We'll help teach you SQL. We'll help look at some of your work. We'll be a thought partner. You could just come learn what we're working on." Whatever it was. We would do two hours every week of Office Hours at different times to be friendly to different time zones.

(01:03:52):
And I think one of the things I'm excited about is being able to really empower some of the folks that are still coming to Office Hours for one thing or another to be able to use AI to help edit queries on their own for example, to be able to say, "Here's a query. I want to make this. Please adjust this to our grocery business so that I can see the GOV for grocery." And so working to build these tools that will help not just our team in terms of time saving, and also to be honest, folks are going to use it on our team, but really to be able to empower non-technical users to be able to do things on their own and not have to take up bandwidth for the analytics team.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:40):
So essentially it's a chatbot that anyone in the company can talk to you to get advice on how to write SQL queries, query data and things like that?

Jessica Lachs (01:04:47):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):
Is there a clever name for this chatbot per chance?

Jessica Lachs (01:04:51):
So it's not clever. It's called Ask Data AI, and that's named for our internal Slack channel that used to be the open Q&A for people to ask data. So it's not at all clever.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:51):
But it's clear.

Jessica Lachs (01:05:07):
But again, it goes with the theme of very, very specific naming conventions that we have at DoorDash; Never Delivered and Ask Data AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:18):
I love it. Just clarity above all else. That's something I've learned from an editor that I work with. Jess, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with? For folks that are trying to build their data teams, make their data teams more efficient, is there any final wisdom nugget you'd want to share?

Jessica Lachs (01:05:39):
I think the only thing that I want to reiterate is that you don't necessarily need a formal training in whatever it is you're building. And I think that also goes towards the folks that you hire onto the team. And so I mentioned earlier that we've had a lot of folks go to product or go to ops from the team. What I didn't mention is how many folks we've actually had join the analytics team from partner teams. So whether that was from engineering or from our ops team or marketing or finance, we are a net importer of talent as opposed to a net exporter of talent. And I think that that's because my own experience coming over from operations, from being a GM and making that transition into analytics, I find that I'm drawn to other folks who want to make a similar transition.

(01:06:39):
Now again, you have to have the technical skills, and most of these folks have acquired these skills on the job, whatever job they are doing at DoorDash before they transition to the analytics team, or they had maybe some formal training in school. But I love seeing the folks that make that transition and actually want to join the analytics team, even if they're not a career or data scientist. I think it creates a really unique environment where you have folks on the team from different backgrounds with different expertise who can teach each other things. So I can teach you how to build a discounted cash flow model in Excel, and I can learn how to make kick-ass slides from someone who has a background in consulting. And I can learn about common gotchas in statistics from someone who comes to us with a Master's or a PhD in statistics, and we've got our econometrics folks and we've got our economists. We just have a group of people with different backgrounds who can all teach each other how to be better. And we're not all carbon copies of each other.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):
What I'm hearing is you try to optimize almost for a lot of different complementary skills and very different backgrounds almost.

Jessica Lachs (01:08:02):
Exactly. And also people who have experience at different size companies. I think I love folks from startups who have that hustle and grit, but I also love folks who've seen what scale looks like and can help us see around corners as far as what problems we will encounter as the business is growing. And I think it is not just about a diversity of skill and a diversity of background, it's also diversity of prior company and stage. That can be really a unique way to think about structuring your team so that you get the best of both worlds.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):
Amazing. Well, just when you thought we were done, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Jessica Lachs (01:08:47):
I am. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:48):
Let's do it. Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jessica Lachs (01:08:55):
I tend to read fiction, particularly historical fiction, and I love spy novels. So I think my brain is always in problem-solving mode even when reading. A recent book that I read that I enjoyed was The Rose Code by Kate Quinn, and it's about women code breakers in World War II, and I really enjoyed that. But rather than recommending a book... I guess I did just recommend a book, but rather than recommending another book, I am going to recommend the Libby app and supporting your local public library because I love the library and I love Libby, so I'll give that as my other recommendation.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:37):
Beautiful. Very on brand with sharing economy, company stuff. Libby. Cool. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jessica Lachs (01:09:46):
Yeah, another one. I don't actually watch a lot of TV, definitely don't watch a lot of movies. In fact, haven't seen some of the movie greats. I get yelled at a lot by my friend. "I can't believe you haven't seen that." I tend to re-watch things, so series from the past, over and over again. I think it's just like how I shut my brain off. So I've recently re-watched The West Wing, which is one of my favorite shows of all time, probably for the 50th time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):
Oh my God.

Jessica Lachs (01:10:16):
And Alias, which was a Jennifer Garner series from the early 2000s. Also, Spy. So I'm noticing a theme. I think I really love the spy genre. But yeah, I've watched those. They're both great, but not at all current.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:33):
Perfect. Perfectly acceptable. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?

Jessica Lachs (01:10:39):
This is a bit of a curveball. So Korean sunscreens. So I burn really easily, so I have to wear sunscreen and I love Korean sunscreens. I was introduced to them by a friend of mine, and they're just far superior to what we have in the US. So I highly recommend people give Korean sunscreens a try, particularly there's a Beauty of Joseon on branded sunscreen. It's just amazing and is delightful to wear, which is important when you have to wear it every day.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):
I've been trying to wear more sunscreen as I age, and so this is a really good tip. Was that a brand you recommended?

Jessica Lachs (01:11:15):
Yeah. So Beauty of Joseon is the brand.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
Beauty of Joseon.

Jessica Lachs (01:11:18):
There's another brand, Isntree, which also has a great sunscreen. But I'll be honest, almost every Korean sunscreen I've tried is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):
Okay. I'm Googling this as soon as we get off. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and share and or share with family and friends even more [inaudible 01:11:39]?

Jessica Lachs (01:11:40):
I do. So there's a John Steinbeck quote, which I'm not big on quotes, but I like this one, which is that, "It's a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it." I find that that's something I really live by. First off, I love sleep and I try to get as much of it as possible. But the other thing is that if I'm stuck on a problem or if I am writing a response to something like a tense issue or an emotional issue, often I find that if I put down my thoughts, go to sleep, check it in the morning, I end up with a better outcome. So all of a sudden you have a new perspective and clarity on a problem you were stuck on, or you realize that you weren't clear in the way you were communicating your thoughts because you were emotional about something and you're able to put together a much better response to an e-mail or to whatever problem you're handling. So sleep can solve lots of problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:46):
I love sleep as well. I'm always telling my wife, "Let's go to sleep." Like, "Okay, I'll be there soon." I love that advice. Okay, two more questions. Who's influenced you most in your career? Is there someone that comes to mind?

Jessica Lachs (01:13:00):
So I think two answers, a multi-part answer. So I think first my career has been in male-dominated industries and I've worked with just some incredible women who've really influenced me. When I was a banker, there were two senior bankers, Vanessa Roberts and Gina Tarone at Lehman Brothers where I worked. And they were just so incredible. They were just so good at their jobs and I found that really inspiring.

(01:13:29):
And then at DoorDash, Tia Sherringham, who is our GC, and Liz Jarvis-Shean, who leads comms, are just dominant in their fields. And I think that that's really empowering and have been big influences on me to just see strong, powerful women kicking ass and that helps me believe that I can do the same. So that's one answer.

(01:13:54):
And then the other answer, sort of cliche, but my parents. My mom was a statistician at the UN before she got married, and she actually chose to stay home and raise three children, so I'm the youngest. And when I was in, I think it was elementary school, decided to go back to school, switch careers and become a nurse. And so the fact that she embarked on this completely new career in her forties after 15 years as a stay-at-home mom and my father supported this. I think that that was really, really influential and was probably the first time I saw that you can do whatever you put your mind to, no matter your age, no matter your circumstances. So that was really influential and I don't think I've ever told her that. So hi, Mom.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):
Hi Mom. Thank you, mom.

Jessica Lachs (01:14:45):
Yeah, I think that was influential for my career. Definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):
That's a beautiful answer. Fun fact, I worked with Liz at Airbnb. Your person you just mentioned in the comms team.

Jessica Lachs (01:14:57):
[inaudible 01:14:57]. She is great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:58):
She's amazing. Final question. So when you joined DoorDash, imagine it wasn't obvious that it was going to work. I imagine it was still like, "This was a crazy idea. Maybe it'll work, maybe not." Is there a moment you recall where you're like, "I think this is going to be a big success? I think this is actually going to work out?"

Jessica Lachs (01:15:14):
To be honest, I went into DoorDash because I wanted to learn for the experience. I thought it was interesting, problems with interesting people. I never thought too much about whether it would work. I of course wanted it to work and was very competitive and wanted to win. I think there's two moments that stand out. One was when the third party market share data showed that we had become the number one player after, I think we started at number four or five. And I think that that was really exciting to see the trajectory and to see us gain in category share. That was exciting. I probably didn't see it until months after it had happened because we don't spend a ton of time focusing on it, but I do remember somebody wanted to include the graph in some presentation, some sales material, and we're like, "Oh, we're number one. That's incredible. We used to be number five." So I'd say that that was one.

(01:16:17):
The other one that stands out was, the first talk I gave in a lot of these startup talks in the early days in Boston, and I'd asked the audience, "How many of you have used DoorDash?" And there'd be like three people who would raise their hand. And then it was a few years ago, maybe 2018, 2019, and I was giving a talk and I asked the audience, "How many of you have used DoorDash?" And almost everyone's hands went up. And that was actually pretty memorable for me because in my mind, we were still the small startup that no one had heard of where I had to over enunciate the D's in DoorDash. So people didn't think I worked for Jordash, the nineties' denim company. And so that was pretty meaningful to me when just so many people had used the product or were consumers of DoorDash. It was pretty exciting. And I still get excited. I saw DoorDash mentioned in a book recently that I was reading. It was like, "We're in the book." So those little things when you become part of the cultural lingo that I think are really, really special.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:33):
Well, I'm a very happy customer of DoorDash. I've never had a Never Deliver. It's always there, sometimes a little late. Usually it's perfect. Thank you for everything you do. Go team DoorDash.

(01:17:44):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow stuff that you do? I know you've been doing more writing on LinkedIn and things like that, so just help people understand where to find you and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jessica Lachs (01:17:55):
Yeah, so as you mentioned, to find me LinkedIn, I don't have a huge social presence, but I am on LinkedIn and I am currently writing a series of blog posts about my experience building a global analytics org at DoorDash. Some of the lessons I've learned over the last 10 years. So definitely check those out.

(01:18:16):
And as far as your second question of how listeners can be useful to me, I guess read the post on LinkedIn and I'd love to hear what people think, whether you agree with my point of view or not. That being said, be nice. I want honest feedback, but I want kindness as well. So yeah, just engage with the content and let me know what y'all think. I think I do have a broader ask, which is just to encourage folks listening to TruthSeek, something I take seriously at DoorDash. It's a company value. But there's a lot of misinformation out there and it's often up to us as individuals to figure out what's fact and what's fiction. So I have a plea for folks to do your best, to search for the truth and speak the truth, and I think we'll all be better off for it. And of course, use DoorDash.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):
Of course.

Jessica Lachs (01:19:14):
Yes, there are three things that listeners can do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):
You're at DoorDash.com. That was awesome. I love that last point as well in addition, to use DoorDash. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.

Jessica Lachs (01:19:27):
Thank you for having me. It was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):
Same for me. Bye, everyone.

# The social radar: Y Combinator’s secret weapon | Jessica Livingston (co-founder of YC, author)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham, "Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC."

Jessica Livingston (00:00:10):
My three co-founders were deeply technical, but I would look at other things about founders. All these little social cues.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):
Your nickname was the Social Radar. Every interview, everyone always turned to you and they're like, "Jessica, what does their social radar say?"

Jessica Livingston (00:00:24):
I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):
Is there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share?

Jessica Livingston (00:00:36):
He hated their idea, and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. But I remember specifically Joe brought out the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n McCain's, and I just thought, oh my God, they're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
You just talk a bit about this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers.

Jessica Livingston (00:00:56):
Do you sort of need that desperation. You have to burn the boat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):
Today, my guest is Jessica Livingston. Jessica is the co-founder of Y Combinator, the first and most famous startup accelerator, which since 2005 has funded over 5,000 companies, including over 200 unicorns now worth over a billion dollars, including companies like Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Instacart, Reddit, the list goes on. Jessica is also the author of one of the bestselling books about startups, Founders at Work, and hosts the Social Radars Podcast. She lives in England with her husband, who you may know, and her two sons. In our conversation, we dive deep into Jessica's superpower of being the Social Radar. She got this nickname in the early days of YC because she can read people incredibly well. This becomes a huge unfair advantage when you're evaluating and investing in early stage startups and founders, but also becomes useful in every part of your life. There's actually a quiz that I'm going to link to in the show notes called Reading the Mind in the Eyes that I suggest you take to see how you do, and it'll give you a sense of how well you are at reading people.

(00:02:08):
Jessica got a perfect score, just as an example of her unique talents, reading people's emotions along with her superpower and tips on how you can develop your own social radar. We also talk about her fabulous podcast called The Social Radars, some wild early YC stories, including how the interview with the Airbnb founders actually went down, and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jessica Livingston.

(00:02:45):
Jessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Jessica Livingston (00:02:50):
Thanks, Lenny. I'm glad to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):
I want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham. So he wrote, "A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on it had been a one-man show. It's sadly common to read that sort of thing, but the problem with that description is not just that it's unfair, it's also misleading. Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC." I'm hoping with this conversation we help a lot more people understand you. Kind of an implication of this quote that I wanted to ask you about is that there's an implication that you've never gotten the credit that you deserve for starting YC, for helping YC become what it's become. I'm just curious what that's been like for you.

Jessica Livingston (00:03:41):
It's sort of a hard question. It is true, I was one of the co-founders of Y Combinator, and yet I'm often sort of left out of news articles, Wikipedia people want to take my entry off of Wikipedia all the time. I'm not as notable and I'm sort of like, "Gosh, I'm a founder of Y Combinator, author of a best-selling book on startups. What does a girl have to do?" But it is what it is. It's the external views, and it doesn't matter to me. Do you know what I mean? People within YC know what I've done, the Y Combinator alumni know what I've done, my friends and family and people I respect in the Silicon Valley community know what I've done, most of them do. So that's fine.

(00:04:35):
But it is true, I've often been sort of erased, and in some cases it's annoying because it's a lot of people who have a certain narrative about Y Combinator that don't want me to exist, I'm maybe making that up a little bit, or the people that don't want me to be part of the narrative are the ones that think that Y Combinator, it's run by white men, only invests in white men. And gosh, if there was a woman on the founding team making choices of who to fund, that would undermine their narrative. So I think sometimes that's what happens too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):
Fascinating. Just a convenient story to tell sometimes.

(00:05:20):

This episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch; it's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations, or you can use an all-in-one document SDK. Most product managers will tell you, "Paperwork sucks." Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features.

(00:07:11):
For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides.

(00:07:53):
So at YC, your nickname was the Social Radar. Your podcast is called The Social Radars. I haven't seen you talk too much about this skill anywhere else, and that's what I want to spend our time on together to better understand the skill that you've built of being this social radar. How does that sound?

Jessica Livingston (00:08:13):
I will try Lenny, I will try. I don't talk much about it because it's hard to talk about. I don't understand. It's hard to put into words exactly what it is about me, but it's true that my nickname at Y Combinator was the Social Radar. And I think it was because my three co-founders were deeply technical people, and I was not. But I would look at other things about founders. When we'd have these 10-minute interviews, I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? Do they really know about their product? Do they care? Are they going to quit their job? Or are they telling us that they are going to quit their job, but really aren't? All these little social cues that I'd try to pick up on.

(00:09:10):
And in a lot of cases, red flags about them that I'd add to the decision-making process. And so that's why they called me the Social Radar, and it just sort of stuck. And it's because I love people and the dynamics and understanding what's motivating people. I just love it and I love founder psychology, founders personalities. I am absolutely fascinated with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):
I love it. Okay, so we're going to try to unpack as much as we can with the context that you're not exactly sure if you're able to articulate exactly how this power of yours works.

Jessica Livingston (00:09:46):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:48):
There's this line you wrote somewhere, and Paul's written this, and other people, that every interview that you all did early on at YC, everyone always turned to you and they're like, "Jessica, what do you think? What does their social radar say?" Can you just talk a bit about that role that you played in the early days of YC of kind of seeing that side of candidates?

Jessica Livingston (00:10:06):
Well, in the early days, especially before I knew a lot, as much as I know now, about startups and founders, early on, I was learning a lot in the first few years. And in the first few years, it was just the four of us. So I would be in charge of going out telling people, "Wait here while we do the interview, come on in." I'd be in charge of the stopwatch that would time us. And I'd say, "Okay, our time's up." And it was very administrative, and I would observe. Paul, Robert and Trevor, my co-founders would be asking them all sorts of questions about their product and their technology and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would occasionally ask questions, but I'd usually remain pretty silent. And so I don't think people even really noticed me. But I would be just watching them and sort of trying to observe as much as I could, not understanding sometimes even the technology that they were talking about. I let my co-founders do that.

(00:11:06):
And then after, we'd be talking, they'd look at me and they'd be like, "Should we fund them? Jessica, should we fund them?" And sometimes I could tell based on the conversation whether they thought that the technology was good or how they felt, and sometimes I'd say, "Absolutely we should." Or sometimes I'd say, "Guys, I'm a little nervous. Did you see how that founder interrupted the other founder and wouldn't let the other founder talk?" Because my three co-founders sometimes wouldn't notice this.

(00:11:39):
They'd be so caught up in the conversation they were having about the technology, especially Paul. Paul would get really into things. And sometimes I always tease Paul, because one of his defining qualities is that sometimes someone would have an idea that he'd get so excited about that by the end of the interview he'd be giving them ideas about how to grow their product and what they could become. And they'd sit there saying, "Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea." And then he'd say, "Fund them." And I'd say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, Paul, you can't just fund this because you love the idea. Let's take a step back and let's look. Like these two founders are working at Google and they don't say they're going to quit. That's not good." And I'd point out these things that I had observed. But I mean, we always agreed. It was very rare that we wouldn't agree on funding something. We were usually on the same page.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):
I see. It's interesting that you talk about these behaviors, co-founders interrupting each other, or being kind of aggressive here and there. Some people believe that's okay for founders to be like this. A lot of successful founders, Elon, for example, Steve Jobs, who are kind of assholes a lot of times, I imagine, and I've read part of the reason you thought about just the type of person is you're trying to build a specific culture in the early days of YC and you're going to be around these people. So maybe can you talk a bit about just why those elements were important to you and why'd you look for those?

Jessica Livingston (00:13:08):
I've definitely heard that Steve Jobs could be an. I've heard stories. But I think I would've funded him because he's so incredible and he was so smart and so interested in the product and knew... I'm very persuaded by people who know what they're talking about and love their product and are domain experts. But I did consciously, especially early on, less so later on, early on, I did sometimes tend to say, "I really think this person's an asshole, I do not want to fund them." And we often wouldn't. And very early on when we were just funding 10, 20, 30 startups a batch, sometimes I have been known to say, "I don't know if I can have dinner with them every week." It was that point. And I don't think we've ever regretted any of those. It didn't happen all the time, that was rare. But life's too short, and I wanted to be able to work with these founders.

(00:14:16):
And as it turns out, it was sort of important early on in weeding out explicit assholes because that was the basis of our Y Combinator community, which is now thousands of founders. Now, of course, all the founders aren't all running their company anymore, but I would say most all of the founders bring something useful and valuable to the table. So if you ask a question on Bookface, on our forum for founders, someone is going to be there to help you. And it's amazing. And that all started very early on, there was this culture of older batch mates helping newer ones, and this pay-it-forward mentality where everyone helped one another and rooted for one another and made introductions for each other. And I think it's a big part of our Y Combinator community now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:12):
So I wrote down a few of the things that you mentioned you look for, and you looked for in the early days. So let me just share a few of them and let's spend a little more time here. So you looked for, did the founders get along? Are they committed to the idea? Are they ready to quit their job? Are there any red flags? So is there anything else that you remember you spent a lot of time thinking about or looking for then or even now?

Jessica Livingston (00:15:36):
There's looking for in the application and then there's looking for in the interview, and now we have software that looks for all of the red flags in the application that I used to do by hand. In the application, I'd look for just weird things, like was there a huge gap in the equity allocation? Did one founder have 99% and one founder have 1%? That's weird. I'd want to dig in on that. That doesn't feel right. Are they going to quit their job? Are they going to move to Silicon Valley? What are their current shareholders? Is like 90% of their company already owned by someone else? There all these weird things that we like to just flag. And we wouldn't necessarily not fund someone because of them, but it's just more data. So that was in the application that I'd look through all of those.

(00:16:33):
But in the interview I definitely was sort of, one thing I remember I would always look for was, when you'd have a conversation with us, a lot of times, Paul especially, but Robert and Trevor, would really be getting right into the idea and questioning you, and how do you know this? And what about this? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign, always a bad sign. The best founders would say, "Gosh, I have thought about it and here's what I figured out." Or, they just have this almost a tennis match and a conversation rather than closing up and feeling like, oh, this person's interrogating me. You could just sort of, the open-mindedness, the flexible-mindedness of people was really important. I'd get really excited about domain expertise. Like my co-founders, we all loved that. If someone was fixing their own problem in a broken industry, we loved that.

(00:17:39):
Definitely, I'd look for co-founder relationships. And again, I'm not saying I was always right, but you could tell if... One founder, I'll give a story, one founder, once we asked a question and one person started to respond and the other founder put his arm in front of him and said, "I'll answer that question." And it was just so weird that he wouldn't let his co-founder speak. We'd have situations where we'd call people like hackers in a cage, where it's kind of obvious there'd be a business founder, business person, who had clearly convinced a programmer to join the team. They were given, the programmer was given, very little equity and just we called them programmers in a cage, like hackers in a cage. And sometimes that works out, I'm not saying it doesn't. But I'd always try to observe, okay, does this hacker in a cage have any say in the company, the direction of the product? That sort of thing. Because the programmer needs to have opinions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:50):
It's so funny. I love this metaphor. And I totally get what you mean. I want to unpack a couple of these, because this is exactly where I was hoping we'd go. So this idea of looking for defensiveness and being open to change and being flexible, why do you think that was so important to successful founders? Why did you look for that? Why was that a predictor of success?

Jessica Livingston (00:19:10):
Several things. First of all, being defensive is really bad, if you're a startup founder, because you're always going to get people who question you. And it's your job to educate them, if it's a new area, you're doing something presumably pretty new, you're always going to have people who question it or say, "That product's already out there, why is yours better?" You have to educate them. You don't want to be defensive about it. Also, a lot of times, the first idea isn't bang right on, the right idea, and you have to be open-minded and maybe adjust it in a certain direction. The famous PayPal story, how it started off being the PalmPilot, or money transfer. And money transfer between the PalmPilots or whatever. And then all the customers were using a janky version on the web, and they were begging for this to be on the web. And finally, the founder said, "Oh, I see what most people want this for." You have to be open-minded to see what direction really is what your users want. And so if you find someone is defensive, usually they're not open-minded.

(00:20:26):
The other thing is that the best founders will want to learn from other people and listen to other people. You talk to the Collison brothers and say something, they ask you a question, they're listening to your answer. So many founders think, oh, I can't learn from anyone. But the best founders are always listening and having spirited debates about things. I mean, that's part of the process. And so I think when someone's defensive, it's just a bad sign. So I would look for that.

(00:21:01):
I loved when I'd find someone sort of showcase that they'd make something happen no matter what; they're scrappy, they're hustlers. I remember... Can I tell the story about the Airbnb interview?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:17):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:21:17):
Okay, because that was definitely one I'll never forget. That was one that was clear the founders were really good. The market had just crashed basically with all the banks going out of business and everything. And so we were only funding startups that we felt had really scrappy founders and could be cockroaches, meaning could live off of very little amounts of money, or could charge customers and make money. And we didn't fund that many people in that winter '09 batch. So we're being very strict with ourselves, very disciplined about things. And the Airbnb guys came in, and I just remember they had a contagious amount of energy. They just had an energy about them the way that they talked about their product, which was crazy at the time, staying in someone's bed or airbed. In fact, it's a famous part of the story, we hated their idea and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. So we didn't even like the idea. But I remember specifically they brought, at the end, Joe brought out these, the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n Crunch's or Cap'n McCain's or whatever.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):
Cap'n McCain's, yeah.

Jessica Livingston (00:22:34):
Yeah, Cap'n McCain's. They were saying that they went to some Costco or something and bought off-brand Cheerios and off-brand Cap'n Crunch's, took them out of the box, put them in this new box, glue-gunned it shut. And I just thought, oh my God, these guys are really going to great lengths for this. And for some reason, it was silly, but it really appealed to me. They're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed. And even though we were skeptical about the idea, I think we definitely made the right bet on the founders, and it was just very clear in that interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:17):
I'm so happy you shared that story, I was definitely going to ask about it. It's so funny because I've heard that story at least a hundred times working at Airbnb, they tell the beginning of Airbnb every chance they get at every all-hands. It's like a recurring theme. And it's great to hear that basically it went exactly the way they describe. Oftentimes, there's a myth around what happened, but that's exactly how they describe it.

Jessica Livingston (00:23:41):
No, it was definitely a whole crazy story and how Paul called them to accept them, and they were on the 280 or something or the 101 and the reception went down. And so he didn't hear if they were accepted or not. Did he tell that part?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):
No, I haven't heard that part.

Jessica Livingston (00:23:58):
Oh yeah, that's part of the story. And they had to keep driving to get to talk to Paul again and find out that they were accepted. Oh, yeah. It was just a crazy interview.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
The element of the story I'm also curious about is, the way Joe tells it, is he had the box in his backpack. And as they were walking out, Paul or you is like, "Hey, what's that? What's that cereal box doing there?" Is that how it went, or is it more like, "Hey, we have this cereal thing."?

Jessica Livingston (00:24:24):
I don't think Paul and I looked in his backpack and asked. I think there was definitely some pressure on Joe not to show us the cereal boxes. I think Nate was really down on that, especially. And I think they were walking out the door and they're like, "Hey, we just brought you a little something." I think Joe did pull it out, and we had an extra minute or so around the cereal boxes. That's how I heard about the glue gun story and everything. But I think Joe had been reluctant, but he did it at the end and I think it was a good call.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):
That's so funny. And after that meeting, what was that conversation like between you and Paul? Was it just like everyone's like, "We definitely got to do this."? Or was it like you being like, "Hey, these guys are really interesting."?

Jessica Livingston (00:25:10):
No, I think we all liked them. We all liked them. But I remember saying, "We have got to..." I just remember being like, "We've got to fund these guys. I don't know about the idea. Maybe they'll change their idea, who knows? But they seem really great." Again, the energy level and the passion with which they spoke about their experience hosting, because they'd been around struggling, but had been a company with an idea for a little while before they applied to YC. We were there basically their Hail Mary, their last resort for them. And so they could tell us about their story about how they hosted the people at a conference, and there was definitely some magic to it, which was convincing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):
Is there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share while we're on that topic?

Jessica Livingston (00:26:01):
I mean, the only interesting thing as it relates to being the social radar is that there were just some interviews that I remember because I just thought, this is great. These founders are so good. I'm totally convinced. What they're working on might not work, but I feel like it's so worth the bet based on these founders. And that happened. There were definitely a couple other of our most successful companies that I clearly felt that way about. You just feel like they know what they're talking about, they thought about the problem. They're not solving this problem because it's sort of the problem du jour or fun and exciting. Some are very unsexy problems like when Parker Conrad applied with Zenefits, unsexy HR stuff, benefits stuff. But he knew how broken it was and was trying to fix it. And I love stories like that. There was one story in terms of... The one time I did sort of persuade the rest of the group to fund someone was, do you know the company GOAT, the sneaker?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:13):
Absolutely.

Jessica Livingston (00:27:13):
Okay. When Eddie and Daishin applied, they were not doing the sneaker company, they were doing this group sort of book-a-group-dinner at a restaurant with people you don't know as a way to meet new people. And for some reason, I loved the idea because I thought maybe it could be a secret dating, like a Trojan Horse for a dating sort of site. But I really loved the two founders. And one of the reasons, again, they had this passion about their idea, but they had had this cream puff company before that they had run, and they just told these stories about how hard it was and all this stuff. And I, for some reason, just thought, these are hustlers. These guys are scrappy. They're going to make this succeed. And they didn't make that company succeed, but they pivoted and made GOAT succeed and it's doing really, really well. And I remember that one I definitely had to convince... I mean, not that Paul, Robert and Trevor didn't like them, but I think they really didn't think the idea was that great or just sort of were meh. I was like, "We have to fund them."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:24):
I love sharing these stories. If you have more to share, please keep throwing them out there.

(00:28:27):
So a few things I've noted so far, of things that you look for, and I think it's important to note this is very early stage evaluation where the founder and the team is, it's incredibly important, because the idea often shifts.

Jessica Livingston (00:28:42):
Oh, yeah. This is as early as it gets, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):
Yeah. Oftentimes, just an idea, I imagine.

Jessica Livingston (00:28:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):
So a few things, so far, things that you found to be really valuable to look for. One is this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers, just getting shit done, Obama O's, things like that. And then I think along the same lines, just passion for this idea and just like almost charisma. Is that how you think about it? Or is it just like...

Jessica Livingston (00:29:11):
I hate using the word charisma because there are a lot of charismatic people who are full of baloney, and are just doing a startup because it's a cool thing to do now. And I wouldn't want anyone to get fooled by charisma. There has to be some substance behind that charisma. Of course, we all love talking to more charismatic people than less, and I've certainly talked to my fair share of totally uncharismatic people, but sometimes they're really good founders too. If they know what they're doing and care about the user and are fixing a problem that they have a deep connection to. So I don't want to say someone who's charismatic, but it definitely helps because, as you know, as a founder, you have to do a lot of sales and you have to recruit people and you have to convince investors to fund you and you have to convince users to use your product and all of this stuff. So it does help being charismatic, definitely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:19):
Okay. So there's being super hustler, making shit happen. Domain expertise, something you've mentioned a few times. Just like having deep domain expertise in an area, and I think that's probably where they probably don't pivot oftentimes, where they've actually have experience in that specific problem.

Jessica Livingston (00:30:33):
They might pivot a little bit, they might pivot a little in terms of the actual solution. They might be trying to solve a problem and the first attempt doesn't really work. I haven't mentioned earnestness though.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):
Oh, do tell.

Jessica Livingston (00:30:47):
Earnestness is one of the most important because earnest, sort of to me, is bucketed with authenticity. And to be a successful startup founder, you have to care so much about the problem you're trying to solve, the users you're serving and being earnest about it is so key to success. There are so many wannabe founders, so many people doing it because it's cool or they think this idea is cool, but they don't really, deep down, have what it takes. And I think we always try to fund earnest people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:30):
What does earnest look like in practice? And how does that come across?

Jessica Livingston (00:31:33):
I think it means being sort of humble about... And if you get asked a question in the interview and you don't know the answer, they say, "I don't know the answer to that. I'd have to think about it." Or, "I don't know the answer. I've given it some thought and here's what I have come up with." And they're just honest about things, and they're not trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors thing, which we've definitely gotten people like that, that avoid the question or are doing it for the wrong reasons.

(00:32:08):
I remember there was one group that were 45-year-old men and they were building an app for teenagers in fashion. And I remember just thinking, we were asking them, "Why have you chosen teenagers in fashion?" And it was so clear that they thought they could make easy money, and it wasn't because they cared about fashion. It wasn't because, "Oh, I have a daughter who's really into fashion and I've seen this need." It was just like, they made up the idea. And that is not earnest, that is not authentic to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:47):
You talked about it, so there's this earnestness you look for, also not being defensive. There's this also spectrum of confidence and people believing in what they're doing. Do you have any thoughts on just how to find that? What does that look like when they're too defensive versus they're just confident and then they know what they're talking about?

Jessica Livingston (00:33:03):
Confidence is good. You definitely want confidence. It's hard to... I think you can see it when you experience it. Like someone who's confident in answering your questions but isn't defensive, there's definitely a difference. And I don't know, this is why I'm saying it's sort of hard to articulate these things, but confidence means you can say, "I've thought about that and I don't know the answer." That's confidence. And they'll say, "But here's what I do to try to figure it out. Here are my plans to address that." Confidence, I should have put that upfront because that's very important, especially when it comes to fundraising, you cannot go into an investor meeting lacking confidence. You can come into YC's interview lacking confidence, but we will then help you in the next three months to gain more confidence.

(00:33:58):
And by the way, one of the things we do to help people gain more confidence is to make them believe that their startup is a great investment, to help them create a startup that truly is possibly going to make money or at least worth being a good bet. That's the thing, early stage, the best you can offer is like, "I might not succeed, but I'm definitely a good bet." And we help them with their product, we help them with their ideas, and we help them that, by demo day, they can get up on stage and legitimately say, "We're a good bet and here's why. Let me tell you about our idea." And so we definitely help with confidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:43):
Awesome. A couple other things you mentioned earlier, just to unpack a little bit. So being committed, something you look for, and co-founders getting along. In terms of committed, I imagine, these are very practical things. How are they actually going to stick to this? Are they actually excited to work on this? Maybe talk about that a little bit.

Jessica Livingston (00:35:00):
We all know how hard startups are, but I think you don't really know how hard it is until you actually do it. A lot of people would start a startup still having a job at Google or wherever, and they do it on the side. I do recommend, if people are just getting started and don't want to raise money yet, starting it on the side is a great way to get going, but at some point you have to commit, you have to burn the boat, because we found that founders who were still getting a paycheck and health insurance, once the going got tough, they did not quit their job. And you sort of need that desperation like, "I have to make this startup succeed because it's my job." Not like, "Oh, I'll just stay at Google." You need that. And we found that founders who weren't leaving their jobs, it was just not working out. Or that co-founder would always wind up leaving the company because they didn't want to actually leave their job.

(00:36:01):
And that's fine, there are people that can't leave their jobs for financial reasons. That's fine. You just shouldn't be starting a startup if you're not going to be prepared to leave your job. So that's the leaving of the job thing. And the co-founders getting along, oh my. I spent a lot of my time at Y Combinator when I was there all the time, full time, mediating co-founder disputes. And so many startups died or had near-death experiences because the co-founders didn't get along or broke up. It just happens all the time. And so that's why I think, during interviews, I was desperately trying to search for any clues that the co-founders didn't get along, or if they blatantly contradicted each other. But you could also tell if they were answering, finishing each other's sentences.

(00:36:59):
I love co-founders that have a history together; either they went to school together, they went to college together, work together, maybe they're siblings. Because when you have a long-term relationship, you trust each other and you know each other's weaknesses, and you're usually on the same page with your aspirations and everything. It's really scary when two founders get together just to start the startup and don't have any history. Massive red flag. Sometimes it works out like in the case of Dropbox, Drew and Arash both went to MIT, but I think they didn't know each other before they started Dropbox, and it worked out. But most of the time it doesn't.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):
So we've talked about co-founders getting along, looking for defensiveness, domain expertise, the sign of making shit happen, earnestness. Is there anything else that we've missed that you look for in the founders that tell you maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't?

Jessica Livingston (00:38:02):
Relentlessly resourceful. Paul wrote a whole essay on that. Every founder is different, I never try to say, "Oh, this person doesn't have this. I'm not going to fund them." You always have to... Everyone's different. But I mean, you're an investor. I'm curious, do any of these things surprise you or do you care about these things too?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):
No, absolutely not. Absolutely. And I actually try to avoid pre-seed and early stage because I'm not amazing at it, maybe. This is why I want to learn how to build my social radar skill.

Jessica Livingston (00:38:37):
Oh gosh, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):
Yeah. Tough. It's so tough. It's like so few things actually work out.

Jessica Livingston (00:38:42):
Well, it's because you don't have a lot of data. If someone is just applying with an idea, you have very little data. You can look at where they went to college, what have they built in the past, that's always a great predictor of their ability. And so on the YC's application, we ask them, "What project have you worked on before?" Or whatever. But it's really hard to tell when you're the first investor.

(00:40:00):
When did you first notice that you had this social radar-ish skill and you're better at this than other people?

Jessica Livingston (00:40:08):
Paul used to always call me Detective Livingston. Before I was a social radar, I was Detective Livingston. I cannot help myself noticing weird things, just dumb things, like if Paul had on a yellow T-shirt and then an hour later came in with a blue T-shirt, I'd be like, "Why do you have a blue T-shirt on?" I have to understand what happened in that hour where that T-shirt is different. Or people's what, their relationships, what drives them? I was always like this, and I think it goes back to my childhood.

(00:40:44):
I spent hours and hours on the phone with people, with my girlfriends, dissecting situations, and then all through high school, and college, I mean the amount of time we wasted discussing social matters with people, and boys, and things like that. It was just frightening how much time I wasted, but I just was genuinely interested in it. And what drives people and why did this happen? I don't know if I ever noticed I did this, but it was just, my point is, it's always been a part of me. And I definitely notice and having an aversion to phony people. I always have. I've never been one to fall for someone who's super phony and tried to have them as a friend or anything. I just can tell, and ugh, I hate it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):
Do you feel like it's almost all genetic or do you think there was something in your childhood that pushed you to be good at this?

Jessica Livingston (00:41:42):
I don't know. I really don't know. So this is why I think I'm going to be a bad guest, because I can't give a practical understanding. I mean, I don't really think... I can't say other people in my family are like that, and I can't say that it was part of my upbringing. I just notice these things. I don't know. I should be paying attention to other things, but I'm not, but I'm paying attention to this. I'll give you an example with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:13):
So I looked up your bio to read a little bit about you, and I loved the Dalton Caldwell Podcast. I listened to that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:23):
Fourth most popular of all time.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:26):
Dalton's was?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:27):
Yes.

Jessica Livingston (00:42:28):
Oh, go Dalton. That's awesome. Yeah, it was really good. I learned a lot from it. I love listening to Dalton. But what I really want to know about you is, on the release that you sent, or on the instructions for this podcast, you said, "There might be some edge cases where your podcast isn't good enough to go out. We just want to warn you." And all I could think of is, what prompted that? There has to be a story of what prompted that. No one else would pay attention to that, but I'm just so curious. It's so weird. I'm just a weird person like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):
Yes, I did add that. There's a story, basically, it was just an episode that wasn't amazing and we didn't have that caveat in the prep beforehand, and it felt bad to tell the person.

Jessica Livingston (00:43:19):
See, I knew it. I knew that that had happened.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:23):
That's exactly right. Is there kind of a way you've thought about honing this skill over time? Once you kind of got a sense, "Hey, people keep telling me I'm really good at this." Is there something you've done to help strengthen it?

Jessica Livingston (00:43:35):
No, but one of the things I do try to do is sort of reinforce. Sometimes I'll have a feeling about someone, maybe we fund them, maybe we don't. I'd sort of like to know what happens a few years later. I like to follow up. There definitely have been some situations where I haven't liked someone that we funded and it's taken 5 to 10 years before they failed. And in some cases, for a bad reason. Where I'll say, "Oh, thank God, I was right about that. I did have this feeling." Or, "I knew they'd be successful." Like the GOAT guys who I was saying before, there was definitely a period when Grubwithus, their first startup wasn't doing well, and they were starting, that maybe some people would've given up on them. And now I can say, "I was right about them. That feeling was right."

(00:44:35):
So I do try to sort of follow up with some of the really strong gut instincts that I had, to see if I was right. Often, when I have a gut instinct, it's like a negative thing. So we wind up not funding someone. So I really need to know if that person went on to be super successful. And I will answer your question right now, there's no one that I had a strong dislike for that I sort of said, "We should not fund them," that has gone on to be a super success. Thank God.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Wow, interesting.

Jessica Livingston (00:45:12):
I mean, it doesn't happen all the time that I really put my foot down, but sometimes I have.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
And this feeling, is it like a visceral body thing for you? Or is it like intellectually, you notice, "Hey, this guy's interrupting her and this person doesn't..."?

Jessica Livingston (00:45:26):
More intellectual. But it does come from inside. I don't know how to hone it. It has to come naturally. You have to have a natural interest in people. And so I'm sometimes not listening to all the words and I'm sort of just observing them, I don't know.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):
Have you ever been tricked by someone where you didn't see something you should have seen? Is there anything there?

Jessica Livingston (00:45:52):
Oh, yeah, for sure. I can't really talk about the times I have been tricked just because I don't want to say anything really negative about people, but... Well, there was one example that I do feel comfortable sharing. Ilya Lichtenstein of MixRank. Do you know the guy that stole billions of dollars in Bitcoin from a crypto wallet? Do you not know this crazy, crazy story?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):
Please share.

Jessica Livingston (00:46:21):
I think he's in the joint now. He was definitely convicted of this, and his wife, and they stole billions of dollars. And I definitely don't remember thinking anything bad about him or thinking he could be that kind of person. So that definitely, there've been some doozies like that, where, did not see that one coming.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):
Oh my God. I think what's extraordinary about the fact that that happens rarely is that your interviews are 10 minutes long, and so you have very little time to actually find all these things. And plus, the actual product and the idea and growth strategy and all these things.

Jessica Livingston (00:47:04):
Well, you find a lot can come in reading the application. That's a lot of legwork at the beginning. You read the application. But then the 10 minutes is kind of as long as you need, in most cases. Because we found when they were longer, like 20 minutes, you'd know in 10 minutes and be twiddling your thumbs trying to get through the interview for the next 10 minutes. So we kept them short so we could interview more people. But there have definitely been cases where we've interviewed people, accepted them, and then very soon afterward, we're sort of like, crestfallen like, "Oh, these people are very limp. What were we thinking?" Definitely, we've been tricked in that respect all the time. Or, "Oh gosh, they seem so impressive in the interview and now they're just posers who can't really do anything." Definitely, I'm tricked all the time in little ways. Or, I didn't notice two founders didn't get along and then one co-founder goes missing a week into the program or something crazy. There's all sorts of crazy stuff like that that happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:14):
I think in the game you're playing, I would expect some things to slip through.

Jessica Livingston (00:48:21):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):
You said that there's been kind of an operationalization of some of the things you used to look for in founders, now that you're not actually in the process. Is there a Jessica-as-a-service sort of thing? What kind of stuff have they built that looks for the sorts of things you used to look for in the interview process?

Jessica Livingston (00:48:38):
No, it's all just stuff in application that automatically flags certain things. I actually don't remember all of them, but it's just, all it is, is a, "Please pay attention to this, reader of the application." It's not, "This disqualifies anyone." It's, "Just please pay attention." And those are things like I mentioned, a really crazy equity structure, founders not quitting their job, things like that, that it's important that someone is voting on them and then interviewing them knows. Because I would often, some of the questions I'd ask at the end of the interview, I'd say, "It looks like you have 90% of the stock and your co-founder only has one. Can you tell us why that's the case?" And maybe they could make a case for it, who knows? But at least I'd ask. So the flags just say, "Pay attention to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:37):
Amazing. So if we were to zoom out, in early stage investing, the main thing you need to get right and evaluate as the founder, the social radar skill that you've had from childhood is such an incredible advantage in doing this well, and you could basically say YC is what it is because of this unfair advantage that you all had in the early days. I'm guessing many people listening to this are like, "We need a Jessica on our team. We need to build this skill ourselves. We need to figure out how to integrate social radar into our process." I know you're going to hate this question, but just, do you have any advice for people that want to try to build the skill, get better at this, notice some of these things?

Jessica Livingston (00:50:20):
I really think that our advantage was that my three co-founders were deeply technical people. And I think a lot of investors back then weren't, didn't have that background. And I think that that background really helped YC choose good founders. So I don't want to make it sound like it was that big of a deal, but advice? Advice for how to hone... I mean, I think just try to pay attention to subtle cues. If you really feel like, gosh, I'm so clueless about these things, try to just tell yourself, "Okay, I'm going in to evaluate these founders, evaluate this investment opportunity. I know I'm bad at these kind of judgments. I'm going to remember, do they seem like they get along?" Because there are no trick questions. I don't have any trick questions that you could ask, or it's just paying attention. Have a conversation.

(00:51:26):
Do they understand their product well? Are they defensive? Maybe have your own little checklist that you think about. You don't have to have it written down, but you think about, and then afterward, you spend some time thinking, were they defensive? When I asked them why this is better than the competitor, how did that go? Or ask them, maybe do have some questions, if you don't know how long they've known each other, ask them that question. "How did you two meet? Have you ever worked together before? How's it going?" Just be a little bit more conscious about asking these types of questions to reveal some key information for your investment decision.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:09):
That was an awesome summary of a lot of the stuff we talked about. If anyone ever doubts that you are very good at this, Paul tweeted this quiz, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes quiz, that I took, it's incredibly hard. You basically see a bunch of eyes and you're supposed to judge their emotion, and it's really hard. And you got 36 out of 36, which blows my mind.

Jessica Livingston (00:52:33):
I did nail it. I do have to tell a funny story about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):
Please.

Jessica Livingston (00:52:36):
So Paul, sort of late at night, and he emailed me, because I had gone to bed, but I had my thing, and he emailed me. He's like, "Check out this quiz. I got 25 out of 36. What can you get?" So I got my computer out because I was like, I have to beat Paul. And I did it, and it was really hard. They'd only show the eyes and then it would say, what is this person thinking? Are they happy, sad? But some of them were really hard to distinguish. Are they irritated or are they angry? It's kind of hard to tell the difference between irritated and angry. And I remember looking into these people's eyes saying, "What are they trying to communicate to me? Are they irritated with me or are they mad at me?" Kind of thing.

(00:53:24):
And as I went through, it would tell you if you got it correct. As I almost got to the end, I was like, "Oh my God, this is going to be a near-perfect score. I have to nail this." And when I got 36 out of 36, I was like, "Yes." And I told Paul, he tweeted it. We then, a week later, had this YC event in London, and I swear to God, about 10 people came up to me to talk about this eye quiz and how they had not done well, and what was my secret? It was very amusing. I never thought that anyone would think it was that interesting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):
I love that there's this thing that totally shows this skill you have that is better than everyone else. I took it, all my friends have taken it after that tweet, and the highest we've gotten is 31 of all the people I know.

Jessica Livingston (00:54:11):
Really?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):
And I think when people take it, we'll link to it, they're going to be like, "How can you get 36 out of 36? Impossible."

Jessica Livingston (00:54:19):
You have to look into their eyes and say, "What are they trying to tell me?" I hope you're not trying to tell me you're full of shit with your eyes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:28):
I'm feeling despondent. Just kidding. That's one of the options. I'm like, "What does that even mean?"

Jessica Livingston (00:54:32):
I know. Well, that's the other thing I told Paul, also the challenge is, you really have to understand what each feeling, what that word means. He's like, "Oh, that didn't even occur to me." Because he's such a word person and knows the exact definition of every single word. But I thought some people will struggle understanding the complexities of the emotion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:55):
With the words, I almost felt like I had to do what you did where just like, "What does this word feel like when I'm reading it? Despondent, let's see if these eyes are despondent." I love that trick you shared. So basically you looked at the eyes and you're like, "What is this person trying to tell me?"

Jessica Livingston (00:55:09):
Yeah, that's the best I could do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Amazing. So we're going to link to that quiz. I'm curious what people, if you take it, please leave your score in the comments, see if anyone can get anywhere near Jessica's score. Okay. So speaking of social radar-ing, you have a podcast called The Social Radars.

Jessica Livingston (00:55:12):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):
Let's talk about it.

Jessica Livingston (00:55:27):
Yes, okay.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:28):
First of all, just why did you decide to start a podcast? There's a lot of podcasts in the world. What made you decide to start one?

Jessica Livingston (00:55:32):
Well, I'm really excited that you're asking that question because no one has ever asked me about The Social Radars. Yes, I mean, it's pretty new, but we launched last year. I decided to start The Social Radars because I live off in the English countryside, not really as connected as I'd like to be with Silicon Valley, partly by choice, but I do miss it a lot. And I was finding that as I was catching up with YC alumni that would come visit or I'd see, I just loved the conversations we were having, and I missed that. I missed that connection with these people, and sort of sharing their stories of triumph and failure in some cases, but mostly triumph. At the same time, I became obsessed with this podcast called SmartLess. Have you ever heard of it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):
I've heard of it, haven't listened.

Jessica Livingston (00:56:21):
Okay. So just for the listeners, it is a podcast hosted by three actors; Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. And they invite Hollywood people, actors, directors, musicians, sometimes athletes, on the show. And the thing is, one person, one of the hosts invites the guests, the other two don't know. So there's no preparation, and it's the most fascinating thing. I love movies and I love television, and I can tell you another weird eccentric gift of mine is I remember every name in Hollywood and know all their children and all this stuff because I've been reading People Magazine since I was 13. So I loved, you'd learn so much about the actors as people because they weren't talking from a script or their media messages for promoting a movie. It was like just genuine conversations. Most of the time these actors knew the people and were friends, and I just found it fascinating. I could not stop.

(00:57:25):
And I thought there should be a really informal conversation like this with startup founders so people could understand the people behind the startups. And it's not too scripted and not too, maybe, I don't want to say professional, because I hope it's professional sounding, but it's very conversational and authentic. I was trying to mimic that a little bit. I convinced my colleague and friend, Carolynn Levy, who of course has a full-time job being one of the amazing lawyers within YC, and she's super busy. I convinced her to do it with me so I could have a partner in crime. And then we just started and I said, "We'll do a few episodes, see how it goes, and we'll keep going if it's fun." And I have had so much fun catching up with all the people I've interviewed. At this point, I forget how many podcasts I've even done, but maybe-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:24):
I think about 27-ish.

Jessica Livingston (00:58:26):
27 that have launched yet, and there's a few coming out. Season three, we're still in the middle of that, and still editing some and doing some. But it's been so much fun and I love it, and I hope that people enjoy listening. I hope I'm not just working this really small corner of the room. I hope people enjoy unstructured conversations. But people open up to me though, because what I copied from SmartLess that I liked, they'd say, "Hey, remember when we were at that Oscars party and this happened..." Because they had that relationship with the people they're interviewing, in a lot of cases, I feel like I've had that with a lot of people I'm interviewing and I could say, "Hey, Brian, remember when you interviewed and brought the cereal boxes?" And he could tell, he shared that story. I don't think I knew it before then that they were on the 101 and the phone went out, the reception went out before Paul said that they were accepted. So I learn a lot, and it's really just fascinating to me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:27):
Well, it's an awesome podcast, I've been listening. I'm going to just read some of the guests that you've had on, just so people get a sense of who you're interviewing. So you actually just had Paul Graham on the podcast. He does very few podcast episodes. So that's an unfair advantage you have there. Patrick and John Collison, Brian Chesky, you mentioned Brian Armstrong, Emmett Shear, Tony Xu, like epic people.

Jessica Livingston (00:59:48):
Emmett Shear, by the way, the week after he was named OpenAI CEO for like 72 hours, that one launched. I was like, I could not have planned that timing better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:58):
Is there an episode you'd recommend people start with if they were start to explore your podcast and get into it?

Jessica Livingston (01:00:04):
Honestly, I truly believe this, I'm not BS-ing you, I think they're all really, really good, and there's so many interesting takeaways from every single one. If I were coming to it for the first time, I'd probably choose, I'd look at the guests and say, "Who am I interested in? Have I stayed at an Airbnb and I want to learn more about that?" Or, "Do I use Reddit?" Just see who the guests are and start with someone you're kind of interested in, and I guarantee you'll learn more about this person.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
So across the podcast episodes you've done, I hate when people ask me this question, but I'm going to ask you this question. Is there any big lessons you've learned, any stories that have stuck with you? Any takeaways so far from interviewing all these incredibly successful founders and people?

Jessica Livingston (01:00:48):
My God, I love that question. I don't hate that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):
Okay, I'm glad.

Jessica Livingston (01:00:52):
I could talk for an hour just on... I want to learn from you as an expert podcaster, because I'm still a noob here. What I've learned the hard way, and you probably will nod your head when I say this, is that I talk way too much. I'm a huge windbag and I hate... I don't notice it now when I'm just talking to you and going off and talking, talking, talking. But when I'm editing the podcast and I'm listening to myself ask a question in 20 sentences when I could ask it in two. So I've really had to train myself to keep things short. You want regular short dialogue, you know this, but you also have to interrupt guests if they're going off too much. So the talking of the hosts should be frequent but short. That's the lesson that I've learned.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:52):
Totally agree.

Jessica Livingston (01:01:46):
In terms of content, every single episode is a gem in its own right, and there aren't massive lessons because they're all sort of specific to that person, and I never know exactly which direction we're going to go in when we get into things. But it was interesting. There were definitely some themes with Adora Cheung and Tony Xu of DoorDash where they said they really made a mistake early on scaling into different cities before they had nailed the original city. And that's an important lesson. There's lessons for everyone, I think. In addition to really getting to know these founders, their personal side of their personality, there's some great lessons that they all tell.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):
I love these lessons. Is there anything else you've learned about interviewing? That's something I'm always trying to get better at. I love this point you made. I say the same thing to every podcaster. You talk too much as a host, you should let the guest talk. Just ask the question and let them talk. Is there anything else that you've learned about just how to interview more effectively?

Jessica Livingston (01:02:54):
Remember, I've been interviewing people since YC started because I was working on Founders at Work simultaneously when we started YC, and so that was a collection of interviews. And back then, I can't say I was that good at it. I've gotten much better. And then I've since gone, I used to do a lot of interviews at startup school on stage with people, and now the podcast. I think one thing that is that the guests trust me. They trust that I'm not going to try to have a gotcha moment. I'm not trying to lure them into saying anything controversial. Do I love it when they say something that hasn't been said before? Yes. But I'm not trying to trick them.

(01:03:37):
And just like you, I tell them, "You will have a chance to review this before it goes public." And I think that disarms people and they say, "Okay, I can open up because I know if I regret saying something, it's not like talking to a reporter who's going to publish it." I care about them. I care about making them look good, and I'd never want to betray their trust, and they know that. So that's part of it too. For me, with the podcast, I have some questions that I do ahead of time just so I have something down, but I also just let the conversation go where it's going, and we get into some random tangents that I find are really fascinating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):
Is there a story that stand out to you just that sticks with you from the interviews that just like, "Wow, that was such an incredible story someone shared with me," or, "a lesson learnt."?

Jessica Livingston (01:04:29):
The podcast that really sticks with me is the Parker Conrad episode, of Rippling, but we spent a lot of time on Zenefits because if you didn't follow that story years ago, the press annihilated him. And in talking to him, I learned why. There was a smear campaign paid for by someone still at Zenefits. There were legal threats made to force him to sign this legal document that would allow them to have a non-compete in California so that he couldn't another company, basically making his life miserable, disparaging him. Stories planted in the press. And I had him come on and I had him tell what really happened.

(01:05:29):
And even I, who have seen so much shit behind the scenes with startups in Silicon Valley over the years, stuff you just couldn't believe. This was unbelievable. And the thing that really sticks with me is that no reporter ever, maybe no reporters listened to it, but no one said, "Hey, I got that wrong years ago. I shouldn't have written that. That wasn't true. Let me set the record straight." So he doesn't care. Parker's moved on, he's successful with Rippling, he doesn't think about this stuff. But I do. I care about justice. And it was a horrible thing that was done to him and it affected his health, it affected his life, and I just am glad to have sort of been a conduit to set the record straight.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:24):
That's an awesome episode maybe for people to start with if they want to check out the podcast. And then generally, I just love this rise of ways for tech people to share their story without this drive to create clicks and create gotcha moments and things like that. Just this, I think people call it techno optimism, this idea of just like tech is great, technology is doing great things for us, let's just tell these stories in a really positive way versus look at all the harm they're causing, technology stop, slow it down.

Jessica Livingston (01:06:50):
And I just want to have conversations that I personally find interesting. I'm very selfish about it, Lenny. As long as I have an interesting conversation, I tell Carolyn this all the time, as long as we have 20 listeners, that's all I need. 20 really interested listeners, we'll keep doing it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):
I love that attitude. I wish I had that same feeling. What I look for is, is it growing? That's the thing. I'm like, is it growing at least? If it's growing, no matter what it is, I'm feeling good.

Jessica Livingston (01:07:20):
I need to be a little bit more like that. I don't know any of my statistics. What statistic, you tell me as an experience podcaster, what statistics should I have taped up to my mirror every day and track?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):
There's the correct one and there's a simple one that I look at, which is just downloads of the episode. It's the most basic one you see everywhere. And downloads is a weird one because they might download and not listen to it, but that's just the one that podcast platforms tell you how many people have downloaded it. And that's the one that just tells you generally, are people listening? Are people continuing to listen? Did they remove it from their phone? In theory, you should be looking at retention like how many people are finishing the podcast episode?

Jessica Livingston (01:08:02):
Can you tell that though? I thought these platforms don't share that with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):
Some do, some do. Spotify gives you some of that. Apple, gives you. The worst part about podcasting is the analytics are extremely bad and inconsistent, but there are some of those stats. The other one, okay, here's one to pay attention to, is number of subscribers on the different platforms, people that follow you. That actually is a really important metric to watch.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:26):
Number of subscribers, okay. One thing I also, this is just my personality, I can't bring myself to do what I want to, is ask people if you like The Social Radars, please subscribe and leave a rating and a review. I would do anything to have people leave rating and reviews.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):
If you're listening and you either checking out the podcast or you're already a listener, please leave a rating and a review and subscribe and follow.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:54):
Thank you. Can I ask you a question about podcasting really quickly?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:58):
Sure, let's do it.

Jessica Livingston (01:08:59):
When you do a podcast, after you hang up with a person, can you tell, do you have a gut instinct like, "Oh, that was a really great "?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:07):
What's interesting is, the ones that I sometimes think, holy moly, that was incredible, don't do as well as I would think. And sometimes ones I think didn't go amazing, actually do a lot better than I think. And I think there's a difference between the energy and the fun of it versus the content and the interesting value of the actual conversation. And so sometimes you feel like that was so fun, so good, I loved it, but people are like, "Nah, I didn't learn anything." So those are interesting. That's something I've learned.

Jessica Livingston (01:09:37):
Okay. Yeah, because people come to yours expecting to learn things. Now I'm a little nervous, I'm going to get axed because I'm not teaching them anything valuable.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:46):
You're so modest. This was incredible. I think we've taught people a lot of really important and really actionable things and I know you don't think you did, but you did. And with that, we've covered a ton of ground. We've talked through every single thing that I was hoping we talked through. Is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:08):
No, I mean, honestly I can't think of... I think I windbagged enough.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:14):
This was incredible. You talked exactly the right amount of time. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:24):
Ready as I'll ever be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):
Okay. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?

Jessica Livingston (01:10:31):
Well, I definitely would recommend my first, second and third books would all be P.G. Wodehouse books. Do you know him as an author?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
No.

Jessica Livingston (01:10:41):
Ask Jeeves. Okay, so he was an old school author and he wrote the Ask Jeeves books about the Butler and Bertie Wooster.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):
Not the search engine.

Jessica Livingston (01:10:54):
They're so funny and fabulously written. His use of words makes me laugh so hard. And so I would specifically recommend the starter books that... He wrote tons of books and he lived till he was like a hundred. Start with Very Good, Jeeves or Right ho, Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves. Those three are really good books. And then I tend to read, so Paul's the big reader in the family, he reads riveting books on Roman grains and anything that has to do with medieval history. I tend to read biographies of people, especially musicians, especially English musicians, strangely. And so I've recommended, to a lot of people, if you really want a good autobiography, because I sometimes hate autobiographies because I feel like people hold back and don't really share everything. Keith Richards, his autobiography called Life, is really good if you're a fan of the Rolling Stones at all. That was really good.

(01:12:04):
And then I recently read Barbra Streisand's biography called, I think it's called, My Name is Barbra something, and I kept thinking as I was reading this, every female founder should read this book. And you're looking at me like that's so random, but it's because she was such a success within this totally male-dominated world of Hollywood and just treated like garbage and dismissed and called a diva when she was very particular about something. Whereas, a man would be called a great director and she was called a diva, and I felt like every woman should just read this to inspire them. It was such a great book. Long, but very good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):
Incredible recommendations. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Jessica Livingston (01:12:57):
I don't tend to watch recent movies. I watch old school movies from the 50s through the 90s and stuff. My favorite new TV show, just off the top of my head right now, is Clarkson's Farm. Have you heard of that, on Amazon?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:12):
Nope.

Jessica Livingston (01:13:13):
Jeremy Clarkson, he's in the show called Top Gear. I don't watch that. But he lives out in the English countryside. He has a farm, and he decided that he'd farm it. And the whole show is about him getting into this business that he knows nothing about, everything goes wrong, but it is hysterical and heartbreaking at the same time. I've learned so much about England and about where I live and the crops that are grown, and how hard it is for farmers. He's really shone a light on the difficulty of being a farmer these days and it's fabulous. Clarkson's Farm. And it has some bad language in it, but I do recommend that kids watch it, because it's just a good show to watch as a family if you can deal with a little foul language. The Brits drop a lot of F-bombs.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with people, find useful in work or in life?

Jessica Livingston (01:14:16):
It's so boring, but I always try to treat people the way I'd like to be treated myself, really, is fundamental life lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:26):
It's like boring but so powerful and important. And I try to live that same way. And I think it's a good reminder to people, sometimes the most, I think it was Michael Pollan had said that, "Cliches are cliches because they're so true." They're so true, we're tired of hearing it. Sometimes it's important to be reminded of them. Who's most influenced you in your career? Who do you think of when you're like, this person's really had the most influence on me?

Jessica Livingston (01:14:51):
In my career, I definitely have to say my husband, Paul Graham. I've just learned so much from him over the years, and he's such a good person and I think people who know him, all know that he is. It's just, he has such a big online personality either through Twitter or through his essays. And so he has a lot of people that don't like him, because he also speaks what he believes. And he is not afraid to say anything if he believes it's true and needs to be said. Whereas, I'm the exact opposite. I'm like, "Oh, I'm not going near that. I'm not touching that with a ten-foot pole. I don't even want to get in someone's crosshairs or fight with someone." And I admire that so much. There's so much that he's done with Y Combinator and just in our personal life that is just so admirable and I've really learned a lot from him.

(01:15:53):
It's such a boring thing to learn from your husband, but at the same time, I'm going to extend this, I'm going to windbag a little bit longer. I have learned so much from the founders that we funded. Some of them are just incredible people and have been through so much and survived so much and built these amazing companies that I couldn't have even imagined when we funded them, that these companies would be as successful as they are, and they're all, so many of them, are just great people. And they now teach me things, honestly. Like Brian Chesky teaches me things. The student has become the master. He knows so much more about me and running a business, and I often will go to him for advice. And so I'm really lucky to be surrounded by so many smart people in the startup world, because as a startup nerd, I could talk about startups and think about them all the time, and it's so great to have all these people around sort of lifting me up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):
Would you believe that a cereal experience led to a 92 billion business today? I just looked it up, how big they've gotten.

Jessica Livingston (01:17:09):
Honestly, I wouldn't. I wish I could say, "Oh, I knew they'd be this big." But the truth is, with all of the super successful startups, yeah you can remember feeling very positively about them and certainly feeling like, as they went along in the first few years, like they're doing really well, they're really determined, they're doing a great job, but you just never really think. They themselves, probably didn't realize that they'd ever be that big. Let's face it. That's just the way startups are.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):
Okay. Here's the actual final question. Is there a fun story of early days YC, whether it's with Airbnb founders or Paul or anything that comes to mind as just like, wow, what a different time that was, or what a surprising thing that happened then?

Jessica Livingston (01:17:58):
It's funny you ask, because actually one of my ideas I've had lately is that I want to start thinking about writing sort of a YC biography kind of book. I don't know when the time is, but the point is, I have to remember things because it's hard. When it's been 20 years to go way back, you have to remember specific things that happened. YC, I just remember the early days being so magical and so pure. When we started, no one knew about us, no one was bothering us. We just did what we were doing with no distractions. We were helping, albeit a very small group of founders, eight in that first summer, we were just doing what we loved doing and growing organically. And no one was scrutinizing us or blaming us for things or writing negative news stories about us. The negative stories in the press, because I'm a people-person and I'm very sensitive, Paul's not as sensitive as me, and so he doesn't care if there's a negative story in the press that's not true.

(01:19:09):
I do. It really affected me, and I hated when we got big enough that people would lie about us and say bad things. So I look back fondly when we first started of it was the most fun time of my life, the most productive time of my life, didn't have kids then, and I could just help the founders and learn about all these exciting things that happened in the startup world, because it was new to me then, the startup world was new when we started Y Combinator, so I had a lot of learning to do. And I met all these cool people, and it was just very authentic, no one was doing it to be cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:48):
Okay. Well, let me ask maybe one other question. Was there a moment when you felt like YC was working? When it felt like, wow, maybe this is going to make it?

Jessica Livingston (01:19:56):
There were sort of two moments that I remember I felt like YC was working, because remember, we started Y Combinator as 100% like an experiment. Could we fund younger founders with small amounts of money? That was it. Then that summer we created this batch investment idea, and then that became the idea of funding them in batches. And that was the first aha moment was after that first summer when we invited people to participate in the Summer Founders Program, which is what it was called. And remember, that first summer had Sam Altman, Emmett Shear, Justin Kan, Alexis and Steve of Reddit, they were in the first batch. And the batch thing worked really well because they all became friends. We could have dinner every week, and bring in guest speakers and then introduce them to investors at demo day, and that whole batch-investing thing was an aha moment and we said, "Oh my gosh, let's keep doing this. This really works." And so that was a moment where we knew we were onto something, and that's when we then did it in California in the winter.

(01:21:11):
But the second big moment was probably, I remember it was like a year later, and no reporter would write about us, investors really didn't think that much of us, but I remember when Reddit got bought by Condé Nast in 2006. It was that, and then at the same time, I think it was like Charles River Ventures or one of these Boston, maybe it wasn't even Boston, but it was a VC firm, did the seed program where they invested maybe a 100K in startups, and the press loved that. They wrote all about this $100,000 investment, and they'd sort of mentioned Y Combinator as doing small investments. And then that, coupled with the Reddit press, sort of made us feel like, oh my gosh, we are sort of legitimate, and the eyes of outsiders became sort of aware of who we were. And I sort of felt like we've arrived, we've been in the press, people are finally paying attention.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:17):
That's amazing. And it's funny that Reddit just went public, it's kind of the other side of that coin.

Jessica Livingston (01:22:21):
I know. Pretty impressive. Definitely didn't necessarily think that was going to be happening.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):
I know you have to run, but I can't help but ask around what you just talked about where you decided to invest in batches. You wrote this really interesting point that none of us had any experience angel investing, and that's where the idea of funding startups and batches came from. We decided to fund a bunch of startups at once during the summer so that we could learn how to invest. And I love that your inexperience in doing it, created this structure. That unique weakness/strength is what led to the way YC operates, and I think that's really interesting.

Jessica Livingston (01:22:59):
Yeah, we definitely wanted to learn more about how to be investors, so that's when we decided to do this summer founders program where we could invest in a whole bunch at once, and then the plan was to go to asynchronous investing like normal investors, but we realized that there was something magical about this batch thing. So sometimes, I always say we love domain experts, but sometimes maybe ignorance is sort of bliss and you just discover new things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):
Jessica, this was everything I hoped it would be. We covered so much ground. I think people are going to love it no matter what you think.

Jessica Livingston (01:23:33):
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Two final questions. Where can folks check out The Social Radars and anything else you want people to know about? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Jessica Livingston (01:23:41):
Well, you check out The Social Radars on all the podcast platforms; Apple, Spotify, Amazon, all of those. And then there's a website, socialradars.com. And they can be helpful by just listening to it and spreading the word because I don't do any marketing for it besides posting on Twitter, just because it's expensive doing a podcast and stuff. So I don't do any marketing. So if it resonates with you, if you find an episode interesting, please spread the word and write a review and rating.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
I was just going to add that, I'm glad you threw that in there. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.

Jessica Livingston (01:24:25):
Thank you so much, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):
Same for me. Bye, everyone.

Jessica Livingston (01:24:30):

# How embracing your emotions will accelerate your career | Joe Hudson (Art of Accomplishment)

## Transcript

Joe Hudson (00:00:00):
A lot of the people in my circles may have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange a life that they enjoy, and it doesn't fucking work.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):
What is holding people back?

Joe Hudson (00:00:09):
It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling, or expressing. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
What the hell? Why would... Why does this... You have this really amazing insight. The voice in your head is often telling you bullshit.

Joe Hudson (00:00:27):
What most people try to do is they try to stop it, and that doesn't work very well. I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day. One of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):
You're really big on helping people feel joy.

Joe Hudson (00:00:45):
It's such an important tool for productivity. If you say, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):
Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone try to experiment with?

Joe Hudson (00:01:02):
Yeah, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):
Today, my guest is Joe Hudson. Joe is one of the most sought-after executive coaches amongst tech leaders and has worked with folks from OpenAI, SpaceX, Apple, and other world-class companies. Joe's unique approach to coaching draws from his spiritual, psychological, and neurological practices. In his intimate courses that he runs a few times a year, and in his podcast, he helps people create the life that they want with enjoyment and ease. In our conversation, Joe shares the two things that he finds most often keep people stuck in their life and in their job, and how to work on getting these things unstuck. Why the critical voice in your head is always wrong, contradictory, and telling you bullshit, and how to build a different relationship with that voice.

(00:01:51):
Why falling in love with your emotions is so important and so powerful. Why you'd be better off focusing on what you want versus what you think you should do or think that you need to do, plus a bunch of amazing advice on how to make better decisions, help your team run more effectively, and why a seven-minute daily gratitude practice will change your life. This episode is basically for every single person. It will make your life and your work better. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Joe Hudson. Joe, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Joe Hudson (00:02:34):
Oh, thanks. Good to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:36):
It's good to have you. I'm curious if there's any common themes that emerge often in terms of what is holding people back from success or just living the life that they want, especially ambitious tech people, which I know is a lot of the folks that you work with. Are there archetypes of like, here's the thing, often come up most often and hold people back?

Joe Hudson (00:02:57):
A nonspecific answer to that would be a critical voice in their head and a relationship with that critical voice that is not productive. Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, "You need me to be productive," but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, "Oh, shit, I'm still miserable." Or, "I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:06):
This episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.ai. Back in 2020 when AI was just a toy, BuildBetter bet that it could cut down on a product team's operational BS. Fast forward to today, 23,000 product teams use purpose-built AI in BuildBetter every day.

Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:07:04):
I would say every single time the voice in your head is wrong. That critical voice in your head. To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, "Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you." It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out.

(00:07:58):
I see the truth that I'd be healthier if I work out. I get that. Should I? Is it really a should? There's another question. What makes it not say, "Oh, hey, why don't you enjoy working out? How do we get you to enjoy working out? What would motivate you to work?" It's not doing any of that. It's, "You should work out, you should work out." It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.

(00:08:46):
Instead of being, "Okay, stop doing that, stop doing that." Say, "Oh, I see that you're really scared and I'm right here with you." Or sing a musical to it or just go, "Eh, I don't believe you." As a matter of fact, I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day to have an experimental approach and say, "Oh, what's the relationship I want with this negative voice in my head?" Because right now, what it's typically doing for most people is that it says something and the person's like, "Yeah." Or, "Yeah, but I'm not going to do that, so fuck off." Or, "Yeah, that'll never work." Something like that is the response. What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):
Oh, wow. I love this so much because there's so much that comes from this thing in your head just shooting you down or scaring you about stuff. It's so hard. I hear this, but it's so hard. Next time I'm, I don't know, giving a big presentation, I'm going to hear like, "Oh, something could go wrong. You could look really stupid or you could totally forget what you're saying." It's hard to really intellectualize, okay, I don't have to listen to this. Is there anything more there just how to turn that around and be like, just shut up?

Joe Hudson (00:10:11):
The shut up usually doesn't work. Experiment with all of it. To me, one of my favorite responses is, "Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you." Because part of the deal is that the voice in the head has assumed the position that it's like the boss, but it's really a little kid having a temper tantrum. If you listen to it, if you just dictated everything it said, it sounds like usually like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum, or it sounds like the way your mom used to chastise you or the way your dad used to chastise you or whatever, a teacher. It isn't, it's not logical, it's not thoughtful, it's typically not thoughtful, it's usually abusive. It's a lot of fear. It's one of my favorites, one of my favorite ways to respond.

(00:11:06):
I've tried, I mean, gosh, dozens of ways, and there's a lot of neat effective ways. I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, "Ah, fuck it." Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, "Ah, fuck it, I messed up," and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.

(00:11:48):
If you do it as an experimental thing, then you can't lose, you're just learning about yourself. You're learning about the voice in your head. The way I like thinking about that is people are like, "I understand the problem, but I don't have a solution." I'm always like, "If you understood the problem, there would be no question about the solution." If you fully understand the problem, you know the solution. All you have to do is really fully understand the voice in your head through a series of experiments and the whole thing goes away.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):
The advice here is next time you're hearing something in your head that you don't think is going to be helpful to you is try to respond to it in a different way from what you've been doing.

Joe Hudson (00:12:25):
I would be even more subtle than that, which is I really wouldn't care if you think it's helpful to you or not. I would just experiment with different ways of interacting with it. I wouldn't even do it as a goal of, okay, I want the voice in the head to be nicer to me. I would do it with the goal of just, hey, how do I learn? How do I understand this thing? It's a far more productive self-development. Generally, it's far more productive to learn, say about the river valley by walking through it, putting your feet in the river, going down the river with a canoe, smelling the soil, looking at the plants, than it is to say, "Okay, I am going to dam this river valley and try to..." You're not going to understand it the same way. You're going to make some mistakes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):
Amazing. The second bucket that you shared of what you find most often is the root of what's holding people back is the way you described is your relationship with your emotions, which I don't think a lot of people would think of as the thing that's holding them back. Can you talk a bit more about what that looks like?

Joe Hudson (00:13:31):
Yeah, a great way to explain it. For the logical folks, so in 2012 or so, there was a person who wrote a book called Descartes' Error, and in Descartes' Error, the whole idea is that I think therefore I am, and this person's like, "Yeah, that's the error." It's a neuroscientist who looked at people who had damage in the emotional center of their brain, and they just basically ceased to be able to make decisions. Their IQ would stay the same, but it would take them half an hour to decide where to have lunch or decide what color pen to use. It would take hours and hours to make simple decisions, so their IQ would stay high, but their entire life would completely fall apart. What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel.

(00:14:23):
You can see this just by asking yourself the question, how many decisions have you made to feel like a success or to not feel like a failure or to feel happier, to not feel trapped? There's these huge buckets of emotions that we are trying to feel and not feel, and we're making decisions based on those. There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue. If you learn to fall in love with all of your emotions, then solution sets become available that you didn't have before. If you are like, "Oh, I can't feel like a failure." Well, then you're probably not going to take certain risks. If you are, "Oh, I want to feel loved and I can't feel unliked by people." Well, then you're not going to say your truth, and then the world is going to not give you the things that are truthful to you.

(00:15:20):
I go into my boss, I say my truth, I get fired. Okay, I get fired, but then probably my next boss, I say my truth, I'm going to find a location where my truth is and how I want to be in the world is going to be acceptable. If I don't do that, if I'm constantly managing myself, then I'm not going to have that reality. It's really important, just for the decision-making part, how important emotions are to be able to fall in love with each of the emotional experiences so you're not making decisions based on your inability to feel stuff. That's like one, there's literally a thousand others. Most people, they feel stuck. They can have a big emotional release and they don't feel stuck anymore. When people feel overwhelmed, it's usually not the amount of crap that they have going on in their life. It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling or expressing. That's another huge chunk of stuff.

(00:16:11):
Depression is usually unmoved anger, is another example. There's so many levels in which people not able to feel really limits their life. Just one that's like almost everybody can relate to is feeling excitement is something that most people can only do for about 10 to 20 seconds. Most people aren't like, "Oh, I'm excited." If you walked into a Denny's and there was this person, a 60-year-old man and just excited and was excited for 10 minutes, you'd be like, "What's wrong with this person?" When we're excited, it's contagious. I walk into a meeting and I'm excited, probably other people are going to walk out excited. We're limiting just our ability to create collaboration by the fact that we're limited by our excitement. I could go on forever. There's so many experiences like this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):
What I'm hearing is the core issues, we're not able to feel our emotion, but there's something there, like we are angry or scared. Because we can't feel it, we just can't break through that.

Joe Hudson (00:17:17):
Not quite. If you have somebody who's experienced a lot of emotional abuse in their life, then they might not be able to feel the emotions that they're having, and particularly where you experienced the emotional abuse. That might be the case for them. For instance, if you had physical abuse and I put a quarter in one of your hands and a key in another one of your hands without telling you which was which, you wouldn't be able to tell me if you'd suffered enough physical abuse because you've literally cut that sensation off. Similarly, people who've experienced emotional abuse can often not tell what the emotions are. Now, emotional abuse is, it's a big word. Generally, people don't even like equating the two. Just to agree on terms here, when I say emotional abuse, I mean you were told that you weren't allowed to have a certain emotion. That's what I mean by emotional abuse.

(00:18:08):
Maybe you got fed every time you got angry or you got your love removed, or you got punished, or maybe every time you cried, you were made fun of. My particular background was that. It's when you weren't allowed to feel certain emotions, you were told to cut it off because it wasn't going to be safe because you're either going to get bribed out of it or punished out of it, or loved removed because of it or made fun of or whatever it is. That might be a step that one has to take, but the place you want to get to is where the emotions are fluid, where it just moves right through you. It doesn't mean that you lose control. As a matter of fact, losing control means that there's still resistance in it.

(00:18:53):
The way I think about this is that emotions are like a tube, let's say, and there's water moving through the tube. You kink a tube one way, the water comes out a little funny. Kink the tube the other way, it comes a little funny. Let's say you have anger and that's the tube of, and you kink it one way and it's like, "You son of a bitch. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." You kink get another way and it's like, "Nice dress. You crank it another way and it's guilt. It's like, "Why would you ever do that to me?" Then if it's unkinked, then it's like Gandhi or Martin Luther king. It's this very loving boundary that's set. It's this clarity of purpose. That's how I think about it. The idea is to get to fluidity, to unkink the hose so that all of the emotional experiences come out with love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):
I did a meditation retreat, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which I know is a big part of your practice and something that led to the work you do now. A term that's coming up for me is non-judgmental awareness. Basically, experiencing the thing you're feeling and just letting it go, not attaching to it, not judging it. Is that along the lines of stuff you'd recommend?

Joe Hudson (00:20:03):
Yeah, it's definitely a huge part of it. There's a couple of things that I noticed get in the way, or the translation gets in the way there. One is it's like, think about emotions as like kids in your house. If a kid came into your house and you're like, "I will be non-judgmentally aware of you." You're probably going to get a very different response from the kid than if you're like, "Oh, I'm so excited to see you. I welcome you in my house." The emotions feel different if you're like, "I am non-judgmentally aware of this emotion," or, "Oh, cool. Oh cool, I'm sad. This is fantastic." If you have that welcoming invitation. One of the quotes that I'm most famous for is joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions and she won't come into a house where her children aren't welcome. A very joyful life is a life where all the other emotions are deeply welcomed, not accepted, not non-judgmentally aware of. I think those are really great steps, don't get me wrong. If you can be in non-judgmental awareness of an emotion, fantastic.

(00:21:14):
The other thing that's a little bit different about what you said is that emotions do need to be felt. If you stop feeling an emotion, you have to constrict your muscles. I can watch somebody come in, come up for one of my coaching rapid coaching sessions. By the crease in their eyebrow, I can know that there's repressed anger. By the hunch in their shoulders, I can tell you about the critical parent that they had. The body takes on a shape that's based on the emotions that you've been taught to hold. You don't just by sitting there, well, it's not entirely true, if you just sit there and feel them in that way without the full expression, they will move eventually, but it might take a couple of decades. You can actually just move them. You can actually make the sound, move your body. All mammals do it. Like mammals releasing fear, they all shake. It's part of how we exist. That's also a really big part of emotional fluidity. It's not just being still and feeling them, it's letting the muscles move, making the sounds.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):
For someone that wants to get better at the skill of feeling emotions, being more in touch with emotions, helping their emotions be more fluid. I know this is a lifelong practice and not something you would just hear on a podcast, okay, I've installed this. Is there anything tactically you can recommend to a listener of just like, here's something you could do this week that'll help you, along these lines?

Joe Hudson (00:22:40):
We have a free audio on our website called Emotional Inquiry, and that would be the easiest way that I would, that's a really good entry level first step into emotional fluidity. The bigger problem is that every step has a different thing. If you're in the not aware of emotions, then that step may not be the right step for you. Though, if you are aware two or three emotions and you can do emotional inquiry, usually, it'll open up a lot of the other ones. There might be a point where you really need expression, and so emotional inquiry is not going to work. Just generally, the emotional inquiry practice is a really good one. What it is, is imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad.

(00:23:28):
You're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad, and that's what emotional inquiry is, is a somatic mental experiencing of an emotional experience in your body and what is it like and what happens when you welcome it. What happens when you love it. What happens when you resist it. It's a series of experiments that you're playing with the emotion and observations and felt sense of the emotion, and that I find to be incredibly, incredibly useful for people.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):
Just getting very curious.

Joe Hudson (00:24:06):
Yeah, a lot of wonder.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):
By the way, the quote you shared about joy being the matriarchy of all the other emotions, imagine people have said this, but inside out too, I think is exactly a representation of what you're talking about, where joy is actually, she's like the protagonist almost. I don't know if you've seen it yet.

Joe Hudson (00:24:25):
I think I've heard about this. I haven't watched it, but I think where you think it's all about being happy and you find out that you have to accept everything for happiness to really work, kind of.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):
Exactly.

Joe Hudson (00:24:35):
Yeah, I have heard about it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):
Anxiety takes over, and then things don't go well. Something else that I've noticed listening to a bunch of your conversations, you do these lightning round coaching sessions with people, and so I listen to a bunch of them. Something that was really interesting to me is that a lot of people come to you and they're like, "Hey, I have this problem. I can't do this hard thing I know I need to do." Or, "I have imposter syndrome just keeping me from doing this thing I need to do." you're often like, "No, that's not actually what's going on here. I can see that's not a problem for you. It's really this other thing." Is that super common where people think they need to work on this one thing, and it turns out that's not at all, they're actually okay at that and something totally else?

Joe Hudson (00:25:13):
I'd maybe put it a little bit differently. They're living in a story that describes an old version of themselves or they don't see themselves clearly enough to be able to see the whole issue, and so they're just kind of living with a story that's in the past. That's a really common thing. Oftentimes, if I do that in a coaching session, typically it's because they're showing me right there that it's not true. Somebody's like, "I'm so scared, I can't do anything." I'm like, "You just got in front of a hundred people to ask me a question. Clearly, you're not so scared that you can't do anything, so I'm not buying it." I don't do it quite like that, I do it with a lot more love than that.

(00:25:54):
Oftentimes, I see that people's stories are a culprit, like how they describe themselves. A great way that you can really see this in folks is that nine out of 10 times that you compliment somebody, I really appreciate this thing about you, they're going to go, "Nah." Or, "Well, my sister is even more." Or, "If you knew me." They're going to do some sort of version like that. It basically is one of the indicators that they can't actually feel who they are. They would rather, in effect, call you a liar. You're lying to me or you're wrong than they would to actually accept the experience of being seen in that way. It does a couple of things. One of the things it does is it stops people from seeing themselves clearly. The other thing it does is it makes people forever want to be seen and complimented and acknowledged and validated because they're getting the food, but they can't digest it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):
Do you have any advice other than working with you and you telling them, "Hey, here's actually going on," for someone to like, okay, maybe revisit, maybe this isn't actually a problem to see what's actually going on?

Joe Hudson (00:27:09):
We have a set of five kind of what we think are foundational tools for transformation, and we do these free workshops on them, and one of them is question the assumption. That's a really great way to have people start to see through their stories. At the beginning, I said, "Nothing in the critical voice in your head says is true." This is how it applies, so typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If somebody says to you, for instance, if somebody comes to me and says, "I am an asshole to my girlfriend." That's their problem. One, you have to assume that the girlfriend doesn't want you to be an asshole, as an example. Two, you have to assume that you know what being an asshole actually is. It's not just what your mom told you an asshole was.

(00:28:04):
Three, there's some validation, there's another assumption, there's some clear thing that says this in the world. Everyone's like, that's an asshole and that's not, rather than what actually happens in the world, which is 50% of the people think that this person is an asshole and 50% think they're a hero. It's something like that. Also, another assumption there is that the problem is that you're an asshole, instead of that you're resisting the fact that you are an asshole, and therefore, it comes out sideways instead of really clear. There's so many assumptions in there. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away.

(00:28:40):
It's like, "Oh, okay, what do I mean by asshole, exactly? How do I define that?" It seems like a silly thing when I am using this example of asshole. I remember this moment in my own development, I was in Bodega Bay, out of all places, and this very good friend of mine at the time was like, "Joe, you're an asshole." I was like, "No, I'm not." He's like, "Why resist it? Just fall in love with the fact that you're an asshole. Just allow yourself to be an asshole for just a minute, just one minute." I stopped, and I thought of like, I was doing venture capital at the time, and I could think of all the things that I had done that somebody would call an asshole, and all the ways in which I was unattuned to people, and I could, "Oh, yeah, okay, I can totally see that I'm an asshole."

(00:29:32):
In that scene, not only in the scene of it, but as the shame fell away, oh, this is nothing I have to defend. This isn't something that I'm a bad person because of, I don't need to be ashamed of it. This is just some actions that I took. As that faded away, then and then over the next couple weeks, lo and behold, I became less of an asshole. It's a strange thing when you really grok that, that it's often shame that holds bad habits in place. Is it a problem that I'm an asshole, or is the problem that I'm ashamed of being an asshole? Is the problem that you're a smoker, is the problem that you're ashamed of being a smoker? Typically, there's so many assumptions built into everything that we call a problem, and if we look through those assumptions, the problems disappear. As in this case, it disappeared for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):
Wow, okay. There's a lot there. It connects to something I know you recently talked about, which is the emotion we want to avoid is the thing we end up experiencing a lot by trying to avoid it. What's going on there?

Joe Hudson (00:30:46):
Since I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us. We all know what it's like to work for a conflict-avoidant CEO or a boss, people get really fucking upset. Eventually, people get really upset. Decisions aren't being made. There's all this tension. It's never relieved.

(00:31:30):
Then wow, sure enough, the conflict-avoidant CEO is dealing with a whole organization that's tense and they feel completely out of control and the fact that they can't do anything about, so that's an example. Or when I was younger, it was emotional abandonment. My dad was an alcoholic, and I didn't want to feel that emotional abandonment again, and so I would get really hard when I felt like people were leaving me, I'd be like, "What the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah?" Which of course, made them abandon me quicker, or I would try to caretaker people, which would build resentment, which would make people abandon me. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
What the hell? Why does this happen?

Joe Hudson (00:32:14):
That doesn't sound right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):
This is counterproductive.

Joe Hudson (00:32:20):
It is counterproductive. I think that the really cool thing about it is you can look at any issue that you're having in your life, so you can say, oh, one of the problems that I have in my life is that I am constantly in an argument with my girlfriend or boyfriend, let's say. What is the thing that you don't want to feel in that argument? I don't want to feel ashamed. You're getting in arguments because you don't want to feel ashamed, and that's making you feel more ashamed. What am I doing at that first time to not feel ashamed? I'm defending myself. Oh, and me defending myself is actually the thing that's starting the fight. You can backward engineer it to, oh, I don't want to feel ashamed, therefore I'm going to defend myself, which creates the fight, which makes me feel more ashamed.

(00:33:10):
Any problem that you're having, you can actually backwards engineer it and see, oh, I can solve that problem by just being okay with that feeling. God damn it, you didn't take out the trash. Oh, that's a shame I don't want to feel. I'm not going to defend myself. I'm going to feel that shame. Oh, yeah, then maybe I'm going to say I'm sorry I didn't take out the trash, or I'm going to say, I don't feel ashamed, I don't want to take out the trash. I have to defend myself to get in the fight, and then I'm going to feel ashamed. You can reverse engineer all your problems this way. It's like it's such a cool hack, but it's very hard. For somehow or another, it's very simple, but very hard for people to utilize.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:53):
This is amazing. The advice is basically feel the thing and just come to terms with this is the emotion I'm feeling, and maybe, like an example, the asshole. Well, maybe I'm an asshole.

Joe Hudson (00:34:03):
It's what's required for you to love and accept yourself would be, and love and accept the emotion that you're having in the moment instead of resist it. There's that saying, what we resist persists. How do you fall in love with and stop resisting the reality on the ground? In doing so, it changes the reality on the ground.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):
In this argument with your supposed girlfriend, say you disagree about her perspective on what's going on. I guess that's not the root issue here. It's your feeling, it's not her perception.

Joe Hudson (00:34:41):
Hey, sweetheart, I really hear you want me to take out the trash, and that's not my truth. That's going to be very different than defending that shame. The defending the shame is going to be like, no, it's not my job to take out the chat. You're trying not to feel the experience, which is what's going to do it. The response isn't the important thing. It's really where the response comes from. It's so interesting because people are taught constantly, this is something we teach in the connection courses that it's really not about the conversation, it's about where you're at in the conversation. For instance, when my friend said to me, "Hey, you're a dick." Here's what he didn't do, he's like, he didn't go, "You're a dick. You asshole. You're being an asshole. You're being a dick. Fucking stop it." He was like, "Eh, you're a dick, so what? What's the problem?" He was coming from a place of love for me, and so I could not be defended in my response to him. It's really where you come from.

(00:35:49):
It's the emotionally where you come from, that's the important part. Not as much what you say. You can see this, a perfect example of this is, this happens all the time in my work. Let's say there's a person who has a CEO and the person is scared of their CEO. Let's say this is the CMO, and they're, "I'm scared of the CEO. I can't say my truth. They're always getting upset. They're going to yell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." I'll say, yeah, there's one person who says it though. The answer is always yes. That CEO has one person who they don't yell at, who they listen to, who they'll take the objection from, that they don't get angry with. It's because there's somebody who doesn't approach them in fear. It's because somebody approaches them a different way. Not with judgment, but like, "Hey, look, this is what we have to pay attention to." It's really about how you're coming at it and not what you're saying typically.

I'm very happy with what advice we've already shared and there's more I want to tap into.

Joe Hudson (00:38:04):
You keep using the word advice, and I just want to, so for anybody who's listening, do not take my advice. Do not, do not, do not. Test it. Experiment. Set up an experiment, try it out. See if it's true for you. It's one, I just made this shit up. Somebody else could make up something different. It's like Jeff Bezos made up Amazon. We make stuff up, but we're humans. Two, is if you instead of just listen to it as a soundbite, if you actually do it and make an experiment out of it, you get to learn. It's in your bones. You get to see what's actually real for you. What's real for you in this moment might not be real for you what's in the next moment. For instance, I could give the advice that says, hey, you can't even control your thoughts.

(00:38:55):
You can't even decide what thought you are going to have next is, it's just going to fucking happen. you're completely out of control, and so it's all a gift. Can you look at life as all a gift? Wow, that could be really useful for one person, but the other person, they feel so disempowered that they're like, "I can't even control my own thoughts. Man, I am totally trapped." They might really need at that moment to learn that, "Oh, I have empowerment, I have choice." That's the advice that they need to hear. Do the experiment, find out what's true for you in this moment. If there's a piece of advice, that's the one I want to give.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:40):
let's share more experiments people can run. Another is this thread that I feel comes up a lot in your work is you're just really big on helping people feel joy. Feels like that's the core of what you're trying to help people is feel more joy. Why is that so important? Why is joy so important, so powerful?

Joe Hudson (00:39:57):
I definitely would not want anyone to feel joy. I wouldn't want to push somebody into or like, "Hey, you should feel joy." What I would say that's a close cousin to that is that enjoyment is such an important tool for productivity. Enjoyment is such an important tool for living a meaningful life. Enjoyment is an amazing tool. As an example, let's say you drive a Ferrari, you're not going to say, hey, that's an efficient car. That's a super-efficient car. You're going to say, no, that's a fast car. Somehow in our own lives, if we get something done quickly, we're efficient, but that's not efficient. You can go and get something done quickly and then you're so exhausted. What's efficient is if at the end of whatever you did, you feel like you have more energy, like you're stoked, like, oh, I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. That's efficiency, is that you've actually used the least amount of energy to get something done. If you say, oh, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient.

(00:41:13):
Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too. If you enjoy running, you're probably going to run more than if you don't enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you're probably going to make a better podcast and you're going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. There's something really, really important about enjoyment because it's not only a measure of efficiency, it also has a strong correlation with hire in most things has a strong correlation with how long you're going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you're going to do, all of that. That's one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. I think one of the things that people do is they say this, they say, "I want to enjoy my life more, so I'm going to do less things, take out the trash, and I'm going to do more things like go on vacation."

(00:42:14):
That's not how enjoyment works. You can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That's a choice. Right now, somebody listening to this as an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you're going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? Typically, what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they'll settle into their body a little bit more, they'll relax a little bit more. They might physically get more comfortable. There's a thousand things that they might do to just enjoy the experience 10% more. That, and in that, they're becoming more efficient in that the quality is getting better in that they're hearing what I'm saying differently. It's just a really powerful tool. What I know the problem to be is that some people will go, "Okay, now I have to enjoy life. I'm going to disregard all these negative emotions so that I'm in enjoyment." That doesn't work. It's horrendous. It's just a recipe for shit stew.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):
Along these lines, how much of the work is learning to enjoy the thing you're doing more versus finding something that you innately enjoy? Which one is more powerful? I guess, which do you point people to? Which experiments do you find people should run more?

Joe Hudson (00:43:31):
In our society, typically, it's how to enjoy what you're doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you're doing more, you're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. It's just an order of operations thing. As compared to there's people, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they're billionaires and they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange life that they enjoy and it doesn't fucking work. They actually have more power to make everything that they're doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn't work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, doesn't do it.

(00:44:25):
Whereas if you really learn to enjoy what's in front of you, all of a sudden, one thing that happens is that you're not as scared of enjoyment. You start saying, "Oh, wow, enjoyment makes me really effective, and so I'm want to do the things that I enjoy." You're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. It's just an order of operations things. If you learn to enjoy the things that you're doing, you're going to naturally start doing the things you enjoy. If you only do the things you enjoy, you will not learn how to enjoy what you're doing very well.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:03):
You show this tip of how can I enjoy this 10% more? Just ask yourself, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:09):
Yes, right now.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):
Is there anything else that you find helpful for helping? Yeah, right now, how can I enjoy this 10% right now?

Joe Hudson (00:45:14):
That's right. It's not about changing anything in the external world.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):
Got it. Internally, what can I do? What can I change about the way I'm experiencing this?

Joe Hudson (00:45:23):
Yeah. I like to ask it as how do you enjoy it 10% more, because if it's what can I change, then there's trying, trying is usually not more enjoyment. It's actually usually letting go of trying that creates more enjoyment. The phrasing can really make or break the question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):
Enjoy it 10% more. Say someone's sitting in a boring meeting that's really sucking their soul, look, they should ask themselves this question, how can I enjoy this 10% more?

Joe Hudson (00:45:51):
Well, should, they can. They get to, it's a great experiment.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:54):
It's an experiment. Okay, perfect.

Joe Hudson (00:45:58):
The reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should and then you don't then you can fail. If you fail, then you're less likely to try it again. That's why the should, it ends up usually in stagnation. If you think about the way it feels in your body when you say, I should do something, and there's a stagnation, there's a, hmm. whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here's an experiment I can do, or here's what I enjoy, there's less stagnation, there's more movement.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:31):
This touches on something else that you talk a lot about, and we've been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don't need to necessarily improve. We've talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there just how to help people learn this?

Joe Hudson (00:46:49):
My favorite metaphor on this one is at what time in the journey of an oak tree is it perfect? Is it when it's an acorn, when it's sprout, when it's 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree? Now, I'm perfect. The idea is ridiculous. It's a similar thing for us. The idea that I need to improve myself, it really disturbs the natural process that's at hand, which is we evolve. We as human beings evolve. If it's like, oh, I'm evolving and I can enjoy it, and I'm acting from my authenticity, then that has a lot of alacrity. That moves quick. If it's I need to improve, there's something wrong with me, I need to improve, I should do it, that all goes really fucking slow. Because there's a lot of emotional stagnation in that.

(00:47:55):
There's a lot of should shame. There's a lot of stagnation in that, and so you don't actually get that natural flow of life. The Taoist talk about this as kind of like a river always finds its way, it just always goes in that direction. We are naturally evolving. That is our nature. Then to put a whole bunch of shoulds and shits in the way just slows the process down. The other thing about authenticity that I think is really important too, is that if you are one of the few people, I'd say 10, 15%, who can say, I should be this way, this way, and this way, and then you do it, which is very few people can actually do that. What most people do is they say, I should do this, should do that, should do that, and then a decade later, they're still saying they should do the same things. Let's say you're one of those really successful people, then you have a life for not you. Then you have a life of who you think you should be, not for who you actually are.

(00:49:02):
If you move from authenticity, naturally, certain things aren't going to work, certain things are going to work. Certain people are going to work, certain people aren't going to work. Certain jobs are going to work. The ones that you end up with over time are going to be the ones that are right for you, not right, for who you think you should be. The most obvious of this is you meet a woman and you're like, oh, this is how I should be for them to love me, and you just do it. You just do everything that you think you should do, and then you get married, and then they love not you, they love who you think you should be. They don't love who you are. What kind of marriage is that? As opposed to, this is who I am and I'm going to be as genuine. I'm going to show you all my parts. I'm going to be as genuine as I can with you. Then if you do get married, you're married to the right person, you're married to the person who actually sees all that and loves that and wants that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):
How do you hold that idea with I also want to get better, I want to develop myself, I want to feel my emotions more, those sorts of things?

Joe Hudson (00:50:10):
I love that I want to, the better part is kind of just, gets a little bit in the way. We all want to, like a little kid wants to run faster. They might want to be a better runner, but the part that they missed, the reason that they develop so fucking quickly is because they don't think they're going to be a better person if they run faster. The idea is like, yeah, you have this natural want, that want is the thing that moves evolution. A plant is like, "Oh, there's sun. I want to move in that direction." As compared to I should. Both of them are human concepts, but the want, it's the thing that what allows us to know that's our evolutionary path. Oh, I have this want to be closer to people. Oh, I have this want for great sex. Oh, I have this want for being able to have a business that supports me.

(00:51:07):
These are great wants, and they show where the growth is occurring or wants to occur. It's like that's our natural evolution. It's great. What makes it need to be better? I want to be better. It just slows it down instead of, it's like saying that what I am is broken and therefore, the whole thing slows down. We try to word everything as more in the experimental framework, but also, we try to word everything as self-awareness, self-experimentation, self-discovery, instead of self-improvement. Because if you understand the problem, then the problem goes away. Just explore it. Just understand it as compared to making a list of things that you should do to get better, that you will eventually fail and then you'll just be stuck in this should loop where you beat yourself up and where most people hang out a lot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):
The experiment here that I'm taking away is think more about your want versus the should, and then things you think you need is okay.

Joe Hudson (00:52:20):
Because typically, when you say, I want to improve, it means the subtext in that is once I do X, Y, and Z, then I'm lovable. Once I do X, Y and Z, then I'm okay. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be worthy. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be enlightened, whatever the fuck, the thing is. That's just not how it works. What works is the person who loves themselves has loving relationships. It's not the person who's done X, Y, and Z so that they can be lovable, has loving relationships. The people who do X, Y and Z, so they can be lovable have relationships where people are critical and constantly telling them that they have to be better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):
Coming back, you just said this interesting quote that you also shared at the beginning. This idea, once we understand the problem, it goes away.

Joe Hudson (00:53:06):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):
Let's make sure people understand what that means. Is it related to this idea once you feel like I'm an asshole, okay, and then like, oh, okay, and then it starts to kind of away, is that the core?

Joe Hudson (00:53:15):
I just mean practically. It's like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don't understand the solution to it? There's a principle, and I can't remember the name of it, like it's Strickland principle or something. It's something that this CFO that I used to work with said, and he would say, "Problems get solved if you spend time on them. If you just give enough attention to a problem, the problem will solve." That's the way it works in business. An unsolvable problem, obviously, it's not going to work that way. The reason that, that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it.

(00:53:58):
Another one, love him or hate him, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem. It's the same thing.

(00:54:47):
If we just explore a problem enough, the solution is apparent. If we understand the problem enough, the solution is apparent. Typically, if we come to a problem with a kid's mind, wonder, if we come to it, what could I learn here? What's exciting? What are the experiments I can run? Then typically, that's the most efficient way, enjoyable way to solve a problem as compared to, I have to get to this problem by this time and we're going to do it this way. Usually, that doesn't work. I could geek out on why that lets democracies win over autocracies because they're far more experimental by nature, and it's not one person saying how things are going, but just generally, just we're more efficient when we're exploring. We're more efficient when we're exploring ourselves and understanding ourselves and trying to improve ourselves.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:46):
There's a couple of more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?

Joe Hudson (00:55:59):
That's similar to what I said before, which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. Let's say I want to have all human beings, I want to be a part of a great team. Nobody has ever raised their hand and said, "I'd like to be a part of a team." Yet, grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not A teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you're unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about if you're conflict avoidant, you're not going to be able to make an A team because there's nothing that is alive doesn't require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. A good team requires tension. If you're going to avoid that experience, you're not going to be as easily, if at all, be able to create a quality team.

(00:57:05):
To be able to look forward to any emotional experience, creates more and more solution sets for more and more optionality. In creating a great team, for instance, you need to be good with people hating you. You need to be good with drawing boundaries and having people upset. You need to be able to have high expectations. You have to be okay with somebody being disappointed with themselves. You have to be okay being disappointed with yourself. All these emotional experiences have to be available to you if you're going to find the solutions to make an A quality team. The more you can fall in love with each emotional experience, the more you have and then the clearer the decision making gets. That's one thing for making great decisions. The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by.

(00:58:06):
We all have a set of principles to live by that we're doing it. For a lot of people, those principles are what do I have to do to get likes on Facebook? I'm going to make a decision based on getting likes on Facebook. I'm going to make decisions based on whatever it is. Pretending that I want to get wealthy or trying to get wealthy or there's a series of things. If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success? Then experiment with them and then refine those principles and then experiment with them. Then there'll be these moments where you don't want to do it, but those are your principles, so you're going to go and do it.

(00:59:03):
As an example for this, one of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation? At any moment in running my business, there's going to be something that we don't want to talk about. How do we lean in and talk about that? We start all of our meetings with what are you scared to say in our business? What are you scared to say? Not all of our meetings, but some of our meetings are started with what are you scared to say? Because we want to embrace that intensity because we know that if we lean into the thing that we're trying to avoid, our life is going to get better, our business is going to get better.

(00:59:57):
If you can see what those principles are for you, and then run experiments to see if they work and then refine them every once in a while. Because of that embrace intensity, if somebody comes to me and says, "You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong." I don't have to think about what I'm going to do. I'm like, "Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing." It's going to be immediate because I live this way. Maybe I don't want to hear it. Maybe I'm having a bad day. Whatever it is. Maybe I'll say, "Hey, I want hear you give me, I'm not able to, give me a day and I'll come back to you." all of a sudden, my decisions get made automatically if I live by a set of principles and very effective, I find very effective living by a set of principles

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:51):
For someone that wants to create their own set of principles. Is there a guide you have? Is there any advice for how to actually go about starting this list, putting it together?

Joe Hudson (01:00:58):
We have a decisions course, which is a large part of it is about how to do that. It's a difficult one to explain because there's a lot of nuance in it. Just as for instance, one of the nuances is defining the principles, not just by what it is, but what it isn't is a really significant, very minor thing, but it ends up being incredibly major. If you're going to do your set of principles and you want to do them on your own, the main thing I would say is keep it to five. I wouldn't even do six. I don't do six, but I keep it to five. I would test each one of them for five days.

(01:01:39):
Make your principle and then see if it works for you for five days and then keep on experimenting until you find five. When you look at those five and you say, "If I do that, if I live by those principles, I am just almost a hundred, if not a hundred percent confident that, that's going to create the life I want if I live by those principles." Then you have a really good start and make them simple. Mine are things like embrace intensity or connection first or everything is in iteration. As soon as I live by them, things work, company works.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):
Amazing. We'll point folks to that course if they want to take it themselves. Cool.

Joe Hudson (01:02:25):
It's only once a year, so it's a rare one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):
Oh, wow. When is the next one?

Joe Hudson (01:02:29):
January.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):
Okay. Not too far away for folks to want to wait. Again, the two pieces of advice you shared, and that's our experiments that we can run to help become better decision makers. One is create a list of life principles, and there's a course that will point people to, to take that. The other is the thing you keep coming back to over and over and over, this idea of falling in love with your emotions, embracing your emotions, welcoming your emotions. There's also, I know you do a lot of work with teams. I imagine there's very similar advice for how to help your team be more effective. Principles, I imagine is a part of it, falling in love.

Joe Hudson (01:03:02):
We've run principles for teams, yeah. That's one of them. Teams would be more effective. We have a lot of, I mean I think I have, at this point, I have 12 things that I'll go into a company and do with a company. Typically, the way I like to do it is I will go in and I'll talk to the leader typically and they'll say, "This is what I want." Then I really want to assess. Typically, if the person who is a big part of creating the problem has a hard time seeing the way through the problem, or it wouldn't have been created generally. This is not demeaning any leader, we all have these issues. Usually, what I like to do is I like to go in and I like to talk to three or four people, see what their perspective, not just the leader's perspective.

(01:03:57):
Then I like to sit in a meeting or two and just see actually what the dynamic is. One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. It's particularly true in Silicon Valley, but it's really true in all businesses that all we are as a company is a group of people's relationships and ideas. Especially, like Amazon, you got a couple of buildings and some servers. There's not a lot of hardware there, and they wouldn't be useful without the people anyways. Anybody, whether you're running a farm or a shoe factory or anybody's successful is going to tell you it's all about the people. The atomic structure is what are our meetings like and how do we make decisions? I'll just really pay attention to a meeting. One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable?

(01:05:04):
Literally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great? It turns out, we've all been in meetings that are hard as shit, and we've walked out and gone, oh, those are great meetings. We've all been in meetings where nothing happens and we're like, "Oh, God. Fuck, another one to just drive a nail through my head. I don't want to sit there." What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, that's one of the things we'll do inside of a company is work with them to figure that out. If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface. Every single one of them. I had ten five -tar meetings, but these two meetings sucked. That tells me exactly where we need to focus as a company.

(01:05:53):
That tells me exactly where to look for the problem that's happening. It's the same thing with decisions. If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you're going to find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend and he's a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? He's like, "Okay, great." He's like, "Yeah, I'm never going to do this." I was like, "Really? Tell me why." He's, "My YouTube meetings fucking suck." That's not where he makes most of his money, but these YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better.

(01:06:39):
Luckily, there's a couple other people around at the time and everyone's like, "No, wait, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? How could this not work for you?" He noticed, oh, the team didn't, the content, none of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, "Ugh." He changed it. He was like, "Okay, I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to see what it's like for me to just say every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that's super enjoyable to me." When he did it, his YouTube numbers went off the charts in a very short period of time. It's just that common. Wherever the meeting is that sucks, it means there's something else that's a problem that needs to be worked on. That's typically how. I can just look at, usually sit in any team meeting and see at least three or four of the major problems that are happening in the company.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):
Such a cool way of thinking about where to focus decision-making meetings. I love that the story comes back to something you shared earlier with the more you enjoy something, the more joy there is, the better it's going to go anyway. The more you can find those moments and make things enjoyable, the better.

Joe Hudson (01:07:45):
The other cool thing is most of the executives or the CEOs that I've worked with, when they get to a point, and it usually takes them like, we always have the goal of a month, it usually takes two months to make sure every one of their meetings is five-star meetings. Once they've done that, then it's like, how do you make sure all of your teams have five-star meetings? Usually, it's like within two months and they usually have half the amount of meetings at the end of it. Half the amount of meetings in their companies are more effective. It's an incredible tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
I could see why people enjoy that if you were meeting as well. Is there anything more along those lines before we start to close out our conversation, either around teams or decision-making?

Joe Hudson (01:08:30):
I'll say for anybody who's running a team, Harvard has got a couple of these, but we used to do these tiny pulses. As a VC, one of the strategies that was really effective that I saw very few VCs doing was I would want these pulse, I would like to read the pulse of teams with these short surveys and stuff. It was the most effective way of not very happy, didn't want to come to work on Monday. They weren't going to make their numbers. The likelihood of them making their numbers is going down. There was this interesting thing that just about how Drucker, I think said it first and then the Virgin guy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):
Branson?

Joe Hudson (01:09:16):
Branson said it. He's like, "Culture eats strategy for breakfast," or some such. If that's true, then it's measurable and it can be a leading indicator, and it absolutely is. If you really pay attention to the culture on a team-by-team basis, it's an amazing, very effective way to drive results, but also, a very effective way to know when bad results are coming. What's interesting to me is most people feel like they can't control the culture, like most people feel like.

(01:09:52):
Most people, I notice, they feel like, it's more likely for me to hear from a CEO, "God damn it, everybody agrees when I get out of the table. When I get off the table, everyone's like, yeah, we're going to do it. Then they don't do it. Why aren't they doing it?" I'm going to hear that more often than I'm going to hear a CEO say, "Oh, wow. I really noticed that the way the email system was working in our company, we were disempowering people by not requiring an action after every..." I'm going to hear more complaints about why shit isn't working than I'm going to hear about strategies, like very gentle, simple strategies to change the culture. it's an amazing thing to me that it's so powerful and yet people feel so out of control with it

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):
To give people something they can do, say today or tomorrow to work on a lot of these things we've been talking about. Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone should try to experiment with in the next day, couple of days or weeks, just to help them be better and more successful and happier?

Joe Hudson (01:11:00):
I would do seven minutes, no less than seven minutes. You can do more than seven minutes. Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day. It can't be, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this. It has to be feeling the gratitude and then seeing what comes out of your mouth when you're coming from the felt sense of gratitude and doing it back and forth. You're savoring the experience of gratitude and you're going back and forth with another human being. Call mom, dad, sister, brother, business partner, friend, and every day just express gratitude back and forth for seven minutes, coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly. Really, really quickly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):
Wow. I already feel it. The practice is you are expressing gratitude to the person you're with.

Joe Hudson (01:12:09):
It can be gratitude for anything in your life. As a matter of fact, I would say do it for a couple of weeks and then do it on the places where you feel lack. That's where the superpower comes in. In my own personal life, I was meditating. I spent seven, eight hours a day meditating for years.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):
That's a lot of hours.

Joe Hudson (01:12:32):
You can imagine, I didn't have a lot of money. The joke I used to make is I would meditate and worry about money most of my day. It's funny, but it's truth. One day, I was thinking about money and thinking I was driving in my car and I was thinking about this billionaire I knew and I was thinking about how I didn't have enough and then I thought, "Oh, this billionaire doesn't think they have enough either. I know I'm well enough." I'm like, "Oh, I have the experience of a billionaire right now." I was like, "He's probably driving in a car somewhere thinking he doesn't have enough, and I'm driving in a car somewhere thinking I don't have enough. This is great. I'm a billionaire."

(01:13:20):
It tickled me, the idea tickled me. Then I was like, well, what happens if I start focusing on everything I do have instead of focusing on what I don't have? Which is where the gratitude practice came from. My wife and I would sit every day and just be grateful for all the physical stuff that we had. We were living in a hobble, were living 15-year-old year cars. We had no money. I was in debt. I was in, I think $40,000 in credit card debt or some crazy shit. We just did it. Literally, was it three months later, my credit card debt was gone. Six months later, I had $60,000 in the bank. Entire life changed because I no longer defined myself by somebody who didn't have, I defined myself as somebody who did have. All of a sudden, I could look out the window and it wasn't, "Oh, shit, I can't have that. I can't have that. I can't have that."

(01:14:18):
I look out the window, I'd say somebody made money on that. Somebody made money on that. Every fucking thing I looked at, somebody made money on. 20 people, 20 companies made money on the fucking lamppost. The person who installed it, the energy company, the rubber company, there's just, holy crap, it's all over the place. Then in that definition, all of a sudden, it became really clear. It doesn't matter if the thing that you feel like you lack is time, or the thing that you feel like you lack is love or the thing that you feel like you lack is money. If you can really do a gratitude practice on the thing that you lack, there's a superpower in that one, changes everything.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
Do you still do this?

Joe Hudson (01:15:00):
I do gratitude, yes. Do I do gratitude on stuff I lack? I don't really have an experience of lack. That's not really...

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:07):
You still do this gratitude, seven minutes?

Joe Hudson (01:15:09):
Of course, yes. That's like asking if I still have sex. Why would I give that up? It feels great.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):
Just to be clear, you find someone seven minutes every morning, probably think about things you're grateful for and share back. Focus not on your intellectual thing you're grateful for, but just what's coming out of your emotional body.

Joe Hudson (01:15:28):
Feel the gratitude.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:30):
Yeah, then gratitude.

Joe Hudson (01:15:30):
Let the feeling of gratitude speak rather than your mind, so that you get the felt sense of it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):
Joe, I'm incredibly grateful for you. I really appreciate you sharing so many experiments for people to run. I think this is going to make a real impact on a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find your courses? I know you have a podcast. Where can folks find the stuff they do online, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:15:55):
First of all, Art of Accomplishment, the podcast, it's Art of Accomplishment with Brett Kistler and Joe Hudson, I think. Then Art of Accomplishment, the website will show you where all the courses are. It'll give you a whole bunch of experiments you can run. There's all sorts of really great information there. The other thing that we just mentioned also is just that we really want to make sure that you think that the courses are for you. The way we do courses is that it's a very felt experience thing. It's not intellectual at all. It's really in your body. The way we like doing it is that you bring real problems that you're having and you use the tools that we teach you. The foundational course for that is called the Connection Course. If you want to get into it, go to the Connection Course.

(01:16:45):
To find out if it's right for you, if you're not already know that it's right for you, we do these little hour and a half free workshops and it'll give you a taste of what it is that we do because it's like anything that's going on out there. It's people doing, they're like, "What the hell was that?" It's just a completely different thing. It's not like learning in the normal way. You literally sit down with another person and run experiments face-to-face with how you're being in the moment. You learn all this stuff through direct experimentation. If you find out it's right for you, you can do it through these workshops, and I'm sure there'll be a place where they can find out where to go for that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):
There's one coming up in September, I believe.

Joe Hudson (01:17:30):
The Connection Course is coming up in September. It's a great place to start. It's foundational for everything else we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):
Then how can listeners be useful to you?

Joe Hudson (01:17:39):
I want my children to grow up in a fantastic world. The best way that, that can happen is that if the people listening to this discover who they are and their nature and the truth of how they operate. Not for them, but for their children and their children's children. You want to do me a favor and make my daughter's world a better place.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:08):
I also just had a son, and so I totally resonate with that.

Joe Hudson (01:18:11):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:13):
Joe, thank you so much for being here. What an amazing podcast episode. This ended up being as I expected.

Joe Hudson (01:18:19):
Pleasure. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it, Lenny.

# What differentiates the highest-performing product teams | John Cutler (The Beautiful Mess)

## Transcript

John Cutler (00:00:00):
Let's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, should I invest more on processes, or should I invest more in people. The first thing is introspection. What do you believe in, really? What do you believe in, and what do the people around you believe in, and how can you be a coherent leader? And you know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy plate, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from like a process-driven meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to like I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of a consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe, and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives.

Lenny (00:00:49):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is John Cutler. John is one of the most prolific, beloved, and longtime writers and sharers of product wisdom online, and as you'll hear at the start of this episode, thanks to his really unique role at Amplitude, he's worked with a large percentage of product teams and product managers around the world. I've learned a lot from John's writings over the years and share his stuff often, and so it was a real honor to chat in depth with John. I anticipated this would happen and it happened, this ended up being the longest episode I've done yet, and honestly, we could have kept going for a lot longer.

(00:01:35):
We chat about what differentiates the highest performing product teams from less well performing product teams, what it takes to create real change within a company, why you should be skeptical of frameworks and tools that you read about online, why all underperforming teams fail in similar ways but high performing teams succeed in many different ways, and so much more. I am confident you will love this episode and I cannot wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you John Cutler after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

(00:02:05):

(00:03:06):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics, and then set you to North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine-learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10 x your experiment velocity.

(00:04:18):
John Cutler, welcome to the podcast.

John Cutler (00:04:21):
Yeah, thanks for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:23):
I kind of know you as John Cutler. I feel weird to call you just John. Do you find that to be true, and also do people call you John Cuttlefish because of your Twitter handle?

John Cutler (00:04:32):
Yeah, John Cuttlefish. There is this, I learned yesterday, there's a DJ, a famous DJ called Jon Cutler without the H, so I don't know if are people into house music knew that. Yeah, I think usually it just, like most Johns, it forms into Cutler or JC or something like that, but just John is good, yeah, for now, or Cuttlefish, you could just call me Cuttlefish. That'd be fine.

Lenny (00:04:51):
You said that actually, we were talking before this, you said you do some music, so is that DJ actually you?

John Cutler (00:04:57):
No, but that would be really funny. In fact, the person yesterday who reached out over Twitter said, "Dude, I don't know what you're doing now in your career, but I really like your earlier work." But that would've been pretty cool to be Jon Cutler, the DJ. I wrote songs and played rock music and stuff, not like a house DJ.

Lenny (00:05:15):
Okay, this could be the next phase of your career which we'll talk a bit about. But let me just say that I'm so incredibly excited for this conversation. I've been hoping to do this for a long time, and now that you're between gigs, we finally found an opportunity to do this, and I just have a feeling this is going to be one of the longest episodes we've done because there's so much I want to ask you, and there's so much interesting stuff that you've had access to and that I think that you can share. So, I hope you're ready for potentially a marathon of an episode.

John Cutler (00:05:40):
Sure, yeah, I'm ready. This is exciting. I'm on vacation now between jobs, so this is the highlight of my day. We can go all day if you want.

Lenny (00:05:47):
All right. Eight hours. Let's do it.

John Cutler (00:05:49):
Terrific.

Lenny (00:05:50):
So, I was thinking that we start with a little bit about this unique role that you had at Amplitude which you just left after about four years, and what's most interesting about it is it give you access to an incredible number of product teams and product managers, unlike anything else I've seen or any other role I've seen before. So, could you just talk a little bit about this role that you had at Amplitude, and what it was like to work with so many product teams and so many product managers?

John Cutler (00:06:16):
Yeah, absolutely. So, first off, I remember almost specifically the day that Sandhya from Amplitude reached out and was sort of floated this idea of this role to me, and I'm so grateful for Sandhya, and Justin, Matt Althauser, Spencer, the whole team, because it was really, it was really kind of a weird role from the beginning. They were starting to get more and more customers who were not traditional startups or kind of growth stage startups showing up, and they needed to figure out how to convey expertise and convey things to the broader product public in a way that would land with those companies, right? I guess, kudos to them thinking this weird idea could work. So, I'm really, really grateful for that.

(00:07:06):
But yeah, my official title was product evangelist. I don't think that I super fit that role, but that was the title that we had, and basically my job was to wake up every morning and do things that would overlap Amplitude the product, but then help uplevel our customers, sort of uplevel the broader product community. I call them current customers and future customers. That's how I woke up every day, I'm either talking to a current customer, I'm talking to a future customer. This product transformation's happening all around the world, just means it's a matter of time, eventually they'll become Amplitude customers, so I should just try to make them awesome and try to help them with different expertise.

(00:07:46):
But my day-to-day was spent a lot advocating for different ways of working, doing coaching, doing workshops. I wrote the North Star Playbook in partnership with Jason who was a co-writer with that. We did a lot of one-to-one coaching sessions. I had these things called product therapy sessions when I would just wake up in the morning and just kind of soak in whatever problem people were having for the day. I did meet with hundreds and hundreds of people and did workshops for thousands and thousands of people and talks for more than that, tens of thousands, really, in terms of the talks. So, it was just a, yeah, crazy experience doing that. So, the technical details is I predominantly reported into marketing and product marketing, and then I did a stint actually where I was on our product team as we were sort of getting our education efforts going, ultimately we moved that over to customer success, and I went back to marketing. So, that's the technical side of it, I reported into marketing.

(00:08:45):
But I do remember the day I arrived and probably a couple weeks later, we had our all hands annual kickoff, and there was a big presentation about our goal being the trusted expert, and that still resonates with me the whole time I was there that an evangelist is there to help uplevel the world with trusted expertise, and in a product like analytics product, there's the product analytics, but then there's whole other ways of working that overlap that. So, yeah, generally that was my role. It kind of is a crazy role, for sure.

Lenny (00:09:16):
That is wild. You're basically like a free product coach for product team. You just come in, help them uplevel the way they build product, and then Amplitude becomes... You need to figure out how to work with data, Amplitude can help you be more data informed. I imagine that's kind of the general idea.

John Cutler (00:09:30):
Yeah, it's funny, I joke with our professional services team. I mean, so if you're a SaaS company, I think sometimes you have a professional services team. At Amplitude, especially the way that we saw that is companies put money in and that sort of creates skin in the game. They're really paying you less for the professional services and more for the accountability and the access to the expertise. So, I would joke with Jenna from that team that maybe we should have monetized all these workshops. I know Gibb and other people, they're charging a good chunk for North Star workshops and here we were just kind of doing them for free.

(00:10:04):
So, ultimately, maybe there was another strategy there, but that we did those generally for free, and sometimes I kind of stuck my foot in it. In the middle of the pandemic at one point we were like, "What are we going to do? We can't travel for workshops." And I would put in my newsletter, "Hey, anyone want a workshop?" And then suddenly, our sales team, we had to grapple with what are we going to do with these 120 leads, how are we going to work with them. It was funny having to deal with it.

(00:10:32):
But yeah, in general, this is a unique role. I would definitely consider a SaaS company's think about a role like this, but it's really nuanced. We can share some links later as I reflected on what we did right and wrong, but ultimately, I think you shouldn't rely on individual people. You should think of evangelists as almost like concentric circles of your community and some people who just happen to have more expertise. Look, our internal team's amazing, Ibrahim, Justin, and Abbie, and when Sandhya was at the company, and just, everyone's an advocate. Everyone's a potential evangelist. It's just that there's only so many hours in the day. So, you could think of your community as just these concentric circles of evangelists and advocates. It's just like how you design it right that does it. So, yeah, recommended. It's a little tricky, but yeah, it was a cool move to do.

Lenny (00:11:19):
That sounds like a future post, how to do this in a different way where they don't have a John Cutler in place. You said you worked with hundreds of teams. Maybe just give us some numbers roughly of how many companies have you worked with, how many product managers do you think you've spoken to in this career.

John Cutler (00:11:32):
Oh geez.

Lenny (00:11:33):
This phase of your career.

John Cutler (00:11:34):
So, I think I did it... There might have been over the four years, maybe 800 one-on-ones, individual leader one-on-ones. I'm thinking it was at the peak, it was in one year's 150 workshops and then overlapped in the next year, then between 200, but mostly the average maybe let's say three or 400 workshops, a hundred a year. It's heavy. And then there was these just general conference talks and other things that we're doing. I tried to total, I exported all my Google Calendar invites, I tried to categorize all them at some point, but really also you have to think about it is that what we did with the North Star Playbook, it was truly a team effort at Amplitude.

(00:12:19):
We started to have our, I think it was Sandhya who needed to like, we had three days to go in to close a customer and they were looking for us for trusted expertise, and she pulled together this workshop and she came up with these three games of product which is a really tricky and cool way to describe how your North Star inputs and North Star should be, and it started this ball rolling, and then they wrote a blog post about it.

(00:12:42):
So, if you search North Star, you get to Sandhya's post. It's an amazing post, and then our CSM started to learn how to do it, and then we were like, "We should write a playbook for it." And then it got to the point where if you go on LinkedIn, people are like, "We used," and I made a whole point of saying we did not invent this thing, but people will say, "We use Amplitude's North Star framework," and I have to always chime in, like, "No, we did not invent that thing. You should go to Sean or you should go to any of these people who've done it in the past." But yeah, the whole point is that a lot of this stuff was evolved over time. It wasn't just some snap marketing campaign to do it.

(00:13:17):
Same thing are our retention playbooks and engagement playbooks. When I arrived at Amplitude, people would send pictures of those playbooks sitting on their desks and people thought, "Oh, it's just this piece of marketing content. How did they pull it together?" I did some research and our CS team developed 110-page bulk of research from working directly with customers around retention engagement, then we had a PM and a great content writer, Archana, zero in and kind of make it palatable, then we did ARC for it. So, it didn't just magically appear. People think that these artifacts that Amplitude has just magically appeared, but they were just... It's a company filled with passionate experts of these things, and it was like tested, iterated, tested, iterated, expanded, tested, put into motion, put into practice, and that's how you create these kind of franchise cornerstone pieces of content for your company. You don't just snap your fingers one day. So, anyway, I wanted to point that out. Huge group effort for all these things.

Lenny (00:14:22):
How does it feel to have left Amplitude at this point? I imagine you're going through some rollercoaster emotions.

John Cutler (00:14:26):
Oh geez. Well, the immense amount of gratitude, definitely, mention that, wonderful people, wonderful customers. Just imagine like if you're a product nerd, one day you're with Amazon, one day you're with Ikea, one day you're with LEGO, one day you're with Intercom, then you're with a two-person startup, and then you're with Figma. So, really, once in a lifetime experience to be able to do that. In fact, if I had been a paid consultant, I never would've been able to do that. Another thing too is that there's this sort of selection bias. If you're a consultant, people come to you to work with you, but often I just had to talk to whatever team wanted access to expertise at Amplitude, not necessarily me. So, I didn't get to dictate A lot of times the conversation. It's like, shit, I'm not doing a very good job here. This person thinks in a very different way to do that.

(00:15:18):
So, yeah, a lot of gratitude. I would say it got really heavy a lot in the sense that my son was born, three months later, I start the job, and then the pandemic kicks in, and every day you're absorbing just attention from teams. You're meeting leaders who are about to leave. Five days later, you're meeting people who are trying to save their team from the pandemic, imploding everything they're doing. Yeah, I'm joke about the product therapy thing, but I would finish the day at 2:00 or 3:00 and then have to do another one. Wake up at 5:00 to do an EMEA workshop, 5:00 to 7:00, be two in workshop, then take a break, then do another two-hour workshop, and then talk to a leader about how everything was going to explode, and then another leader. And then I was still on a team in Amplitude, so I might go to my own meeting where we're working through our own challenges, and then it's 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon. I'm done. Oh, to be able to do that.

(00:16:16):
And then I think it also left me with a couple key lessons we could probably go into later when we're doing it. One, you are talking to a bunch of different companies, achieving the almost similar results in very, very different ways. They behave in different ways, the context in the pandemic or the economy. You would see the pandemic kick in and then you would talk to 50 companies that were dealing with the ramifications of it. So, it's kind of funny, I joked with someone at Amplitude, they're like, "We were going through our own shit," and I'm like, "Yeah, and I've seen how 50 other companies are going through their own shit," where this is you're doing it. So, the power of context.

(00:16:52):
The regional differences were so fascinating. I was on with a teen that was based in India and just the passion and curiosity. There was not one jaded person in the room. There was not one person like, "Been there, done that. When's the performance review cycle ending?" or anything like that. It was just all-out passion and hunger for information. So, those days were amazing. So, yeah, you talk a lot about it, but it definitely, it feels like a relief in some ways because the amount of tension to do it. And so, for my next plan actually what I'm doing is I'm going to work at Toast in a couple weeks, and I've been in touch with a leader there, Craig Daniel, for a long time, kind of really liked what he did at Drift.

(00:17:40):
But I think that what I realized over the course of these four years is that I wanted to pivot back to help put most of my energy into helping my own company. They're growing super fast, so the numbers are in the hundreds of everything or in the thousands of everything, and they're not just the POS business. They've got these different businesses, like guest services and back office stuff and things. Amplitude is a super horizontal, if you think about it, it's almost like a diagonal, and so it made your head spin, and I kind of wanted to go back to a vertical SaaS. There's a company here in Santa Barbara called AppFolio that I like working at, and I really had a soft spot for vertical SaaS, but I'm thinking put my energy into an internal team for a little bit to pivot back into that. And so, I'll be helping enable product teams and sort of doing what I was doing, but within a company as well. So, it's going to be an interesting shift.

Lenny (00:18:29):
You touched on so many topics that I want to dig further into, and you also talked about where you're heading next, which I was going to ask, so that's great. Thank you for covering all that. By the way, I was just going to also say, lucky Toast, wow, to get John Cutler. Go them.

John Cutler (00:18:42):
Oh, lucky me. I mean, Jesus, Toast is this gem. I just was joking with Craig the other day. I was like, "I did not know all that stuff was going on at Toast."

Lenny (00:18:52):
Awesome. Okay. So, before we dig into some of the stuff that you brought up like cultural differences between companies, what the best teams are doing differently, things like that, I actually, and you noticed, I asked on Twitter what I should ask you. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and there's a ton of questions, and one actually got pretty spicy and I want to touch on it briefly. This guy, Jason Cohen pointed out that a lot of the stuff you share online in your newsletter and tweets and things like that, it often doesn't have a clear recommendation of here's what you should do or concrete piece of advice you could take away. It's kind of messy which is appropriate because your newsletter is called A Beautiful Mess. And so, my question to you is why have you found that you like to embrace the mess in your writing and your thinking and your advice?

John Cutler (00:19:38):
I was reflecting that the newsletter, it's almost like an emo band, The Beautiful Mess, it's so angsty. It couldn't have been more... If I had a band, I did not have an emo band when I was 16, but if I did, I would've called it The Beautiful Mess. So, it's probably pretty consistent with personality to do those things. I mean, I actually really appreciated Jason pointing that out, and in fact, at the end of this year, I put this post out to people saying, "Hey, here are things I'm grappling with, like the actionability of the content that I put out there, diversity of product advice, it's important to me," and then what it's like to just be a weirdo. We all have our weird freak things to do these things. And so, what does it mean to embrace those things? So, it was really timely I thought that Jason put that out there, and so maybe I'll give a little background about the newsletter and what I was looking for that.

(00:20:29):
And so, I think that the first thing that I did was four years ago, I kind of scanned the product advice landscape and I noticed three things. First, there's sort of three perspectives that pervaded, and again, I just want to make a huge caveat, this is not a judgment on any of these particular perspectives. It's more like I noticed a lot of it. And the first was that to be successful, number one, maybe success is tools, skills, mindset. So, that's kind of one group of particular things. The second that in terms of worldviews, we mentioned international worldviews too, but there was a high percentage of product advice that was kind of grounded where you think it would be grounded. So, it was grounded in this idea of meritocracy. Success is primarily about merit, very highly individualistic, and we don't realize that in the US until you do meetings with other teams, just how individualistic we can be when it comes to how we think about teams should be set up and stuff.

(00:21:28):
And then I think the third thing I realized was that it was very often very context free, and I mean that actually in the nicest way. It was optimized to make sure that it could be actionable, that someone could take that away. That's what I really like about the content that you put out there, and I like about a lot of the guests on the podcast. They kind of lay it out in those particular things. And so, to kind of go through, yeah, those tools, skills, mindset, that makes sense, right? Who does not want tools to be better? In fact, a lot of the podcasts I like, we can get into that later, are like, "We're going to give you the tools and tactics that the best people do." So, I really like that kind of stuff as well.

(00:22:04):
The second part of that is this idea of success be mostly about individual skills in jobs. So, this idea of great leaders, high performing teams, 10 x people, kind of go on and on. And then the product mindset stuff which is a little bit like you have it or you don't, or you develop or you don't. It's very mysterious. So, again, I'm going to go through these things and then think about how they inspire me. Part of me was like, "Okay, there's a lot of that stuff, but maybe not as much stuff kind of unraveling the dynamics that happen behind those things."

(00:22:36):
So, the meritocracy stuff and the individualism stuff, it's basically the people rise to the top, they try the hardest, they work the hardest, the best in companies employ them. There's top tier companies, there's second tier companies. So, there's this very hierarchical view, and as I started to also dig in more into the stuff in Amplitude, I was like, "Wait, there's something right and wrong about this at the same time, there's something true but not true at the same time." So, that's something that I wanted to be able to explore in doing it. And then the context free advice was obviously I noticed more and more that people trying to put tools in play out of context sometimes had worse effects than them just not doing it at all to do that.

(00:23:18):
So, anyway, I kind of thought about it as a product, like, "Okay, what's my opportunity here? There's a lot of this great advice. It's very actionable. I don't know. In the US were pretty individualistic, so the advice probably lands with people really, really well, and then also it's really actionable," and said, "Okay, well, what would be my particular angle?" So, I thought about the angle, about wanted to explore three things. I think the first one is this idea we do work in these complex adaptive systems, and so I really went deep in that particular area.

(00:23:47):
So, we work in environments. There's lots of things that are interdependent on each other. We don't work in closed systems. I mean, if you're in the Bay Area, you're in this broader system called the Bay Area that's in this broader system called California that's in this broader system called the United States. Your team is in a team of many, many teams in your company. The systems are non-linear. The bird flapping its wings in Brazil creates the tornado type of stuff. And so, I wanted to make sure that we got dug into that particular stuff in The Beautiful Mess stuff.

(00:24:21):
The next thing is that I'm a sucker for weird counterintuitive dynamics in companies. I don't know what it is. I absolutely love that. And so, maybe I'll give two examples. One, I'm obsessed with this idea of high work in progress, from a human level and a team level. How even though we know that if you try to do less at once, you'll be more effective, teams routinely just load themself up with work? And so, in the newsletter, I wanted to explore stuff like that, like why, when a bunch of people know irrationally that you should not load yourself up with work, why do really, really smart, capable, intelligent, passionate people in their personal lives and on their teams just load themself up with work? What are they optimizing about? So, that'd be like one example of counterintuitive stuff.

(00:25:09):
The other stuff is strategy stuff. Every company has these three pillars, and it seems really smart for the CEO to have this really clear three pillars, but then everyone walks away from the meeting and be like, "I don't know what we're with doing." That's another example of a counterintuitive thing. So, that was the second thing, the counterintuitive stuff. I love the complex stuff. And then frankly, I think the other thing is I just wanted to help people who are weird like me do those things. So, I would say I'm really, really triggered. People will say, "But it's probably triggered by Jason." He said, "Why? Bring solutions not just problems." That's my krypton, right? I like the systems thinking stuff. I like all that. So, anyway, long story short, wanted to help people like me. I like the complexity stuff. I like all these weird counterintuitive dynamics. And then I thought that there's a lot of representation for the very deterministic advice that people have.

Lenny (00:26:02):
That's a really good explanation. There-

John Cutler (00:26:00):
... advice that people have.

Lenny (00:26:02):
That's a really good explanation. There's a piece of what does the market want and let me deliver it, and then there's a piece of how is my brain working?

John Cutler (00:26:10):
I love the fact that people scan the market and say, "People want to know about prioritization and so I'm going to tell the world about prioritization." I really like that. In fact, I admire, I'm jealous of people who can produce that kind of content realistically. Interestingly enough, probably in my doodling in post I've probably given frameworks to do that. I just don't think too much about it. I just kind of go in these things. There's always this balance and one way that I think about is to get anything done, we need to reduce the world a little bit. That's the difference.

(00:26:41):
Back to this thing of complex problems, I think it's the difference between oversimplification and focusing. You can have a really complex problem and you can oversimplify it and that's not great, but you can have a complex problem and be like, "You know what? I need to hold some things constant." Not going to make any progress unless we hold some things constant to do that. That's, to me, the balance I'm playing all the time between how many variables to hold constant to make sure that people can get some value out of it. I don't know about you, but that's the tension I have. But you write really actionable stuff and so I really admire that too. I'm jealous.

Lenny (00:27:15):
I try, but then I'm jealous of always having to nail it down to something very concrete and simple. This last post actually was a little bit of an balancing act where I wrote about how virality is mostly a myth, and I added the word mostly to it at the end. Then I was like, "Should I just go for it and be like virality is fully a myth?" But no, it's not actually, so I can't really go that far.

John Cutler (00:27:35):
See, it's kind of messy.

Lenny (00:27:36):
It's kind of messy.

John Cutler (00:27:38):
I love that. In the spectrum of advice, every post of mine will say mostly, maybe, it depends, so we all have some opportunity to flex into the other direction.

Lenny (00:27:49):
Shifting a little bit, coming back to just the bigger picture of John Cutler, you've had more exposure I think to product teams and product managers, you're definitely in the top 1% of people that have talked to and met with and seen what happens within product teams. There's a lot of stuff I want to dig into there and the first is around what you've found differentiates the highest performing teams. Let me just ask you this very succinct question and see where it goes. If you had to just boil it down, what have you seen most differentiates the highest performing product teams?

John Cutler (00:28:26):
First of all, they're top 1%, they're super, super productive, they can levitate, they can do ... they have no emotion. No, I'm just kidding. No. Okay, this is my tack for answering the question. First of all, I have this friend Josh Arnold and he had this great principle that held true in my experience talking with teams and he calls it the reverse Anna Karenina principle. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy is basically the like, "The dysfunctional families are all different and the happy families are the same," and what he said is it's the reverse of that with product teams, that actually the dysfunctional companies are all the same and then the happy companies or the higher performing companies can be very, very different.

(00:29:07):
That's something that stuck with me because either you have easy to identify anti patterns, and I'm going to admit earlier in my career, maybe five or six years ago, my content was about identifying things that people would be like, "How did you know that was working in my company?" and I would just be like, "Well, I just know." Even Spencer and I had this thing. I put something on Twitter and Spencer writes me, he's like, "John, is this about amplitude?" and I'm like, "No man. It's like that Carly Simon song, Spencer. You probably think this song is about you, but it's not." It just is. It's just like those things. Either you have the very easy to identify anti patterns or you have the high level principles, like you must trust each other or you must do something like that.

(00:29:50):
But the way that companies achieve those particular high performing things can be vastly, vastly, vastly different. Let's just start with that as a basic thing, which is one reason why it makes me hard to answer the question. A great example here is great product leadership. We need great product leaders. But you meet [inaudible 00:30:11] product leaders and you see that some people are these humble, curious servant product leaders. They're not really talking a lot and they're just growing the system that way. You know what? There's other companies with really successful people that are just badass, strong, dominant, they like to spar. I need people who can spar with me. That's just one potential example there of okay, you meet enough teams and you see that there's many ways to achieve great leadership [inaudible 00:30:41] example.

(00:30:42):
Another example would be, and then I'm going to start listing these things off and then hopefully this makes more sense.

Lenny (00:30:46):
Yeah, it feels great.

John Cutler (00:30:48):
You meet lots of great teams and the better teams make high, better decisions faster. Now, that's like that high level thing that I say that to you and you're probably like, "Well, no shit. That's what I would assume to do that." But if you think about good decisions and stuff, like what do you need for good decisions? You need information, pays to have diverse perspectives, you need to be able to analyze the data. You probably need chops, some kind of chops in the domain to be able to do it. You usually need a goal in mind, like what are you optimizing for? It's very hard to make a decision just to make a decision to be able to do that.

(00:31:21):
Those are the basics, but still none of that's all that interesting, right? You're like, "Oh, you're saying you need information to make decisions and it's kind of not very satisfying to do that." But then if you think about three companies. We could even play the game together. I'll give you two, you could give me the third one. But let's say company A buys into the whole idea of an extremely rigorous decision-making process. It's very process driven. It's like you do this, you do that, we red team our decisions, we bring in people to push back, we've got this particular thing. Maybe that's how they achieve it. Company B, maybe they're just all about this kind of mushy, diverse perspectives thing. They're not very process driven, but they achieve really good decisions by making sure that there's these serendipitous connections between people at the right time with the right set of [inaudible 00:32:08].

(00:32:08):
There are highly successful companies that achieve both of those particular things. I don't know, what am I missing? Lenny, you think about it. There's the rigorous process driven approach, then there's the company that's all about the ad hoc work together collaborative approach. What's another way that some companies make really good decisions all the time?

Lenny (00:32:28):
What comes to mind is a very top down CEO driven, here's what we're doing, here's the roadmap.

John Cutler (00:32:32):
Absolutely. So this is the thing, I'm sitting there and the very idealistic product managers are like, "You got to have empowered teams and you got to push decision-making down to the bottom," and I'm like, "Huh, well that company's doing pretty well and the CEO just tells everyone what to do and in fact, they attracted people who just don't mind that and like their vision and they do it." You find people who really like the process driven approach and you find people who do those things. That's one principle done a different way. But then I'll just take a couple principles. I just wanted to get that out of the way, that every one of these I mentioned could be achieved in a couple different ways.

(00:33:10):
The first thing you notice is the companies that are very high performing have coherence between the structure of their company and their current strategy. This is a structural thing, I think when there's startups, things are very fluid and the strategy's in flux, and so they have a fluid structure, but then as companies grow, there's sort of a physics to the problem that starts to catch up to the particular things. Their funding approach, their incentives, the org structure, the architecture, even their technical architecture supports their strategy back and forth. The reason why I mentioned this one is you can have brilliant teams. You meet these brilliant teams where they've just hired in the best of the best and they're just struggling with a strategy structure mismatch and no amount of let's empower people or no amount of doing whatever is going to knock them out of that.

(00:34:01):
So what do you need? You need a strategy, then you need to line the structure around it. This is different than saying ... you're asking me what do I observe when they're doing really well? Now, the tactics to achieve this might be different depending on the company, but you could get that. I think the second thing, if I admit it, is the strong opinions loosely held, which is there is this balance of believing in certain things, believing maybe in the power of products or the power of connecting with customers or maybe key strategic things that they need to do, or even believing that this is a done deal and you just need to move faster than everyone else in the space, or even the belief that you need to just go straight to commodity pricing like Amazon with whatever you're doing.

(00:34:41):
There is just a stubborn, strongly held belief that is then balanced with their ability to have the loosely held thing. I would just observed this in meeting after meeting with these teams that seem to be having a bout of being more high performing. They would be stubborn about some things that they were doing even when it didn't make sense in the short term and then they would do that. I think that that's another thing. I think related to that when it comes to the product world is just a core belief in the power of products. The Jeff Bezos thing, that the success of today was set in motion three years ago, that product is a layer cake and that you are layering on decisions, the success you're having now is a layer cake of decisions from the last bunch of years that you're doing it.

(00:35:26):
You could rationalize that all you want, but at the end of the day, it's often because either the founders or other people involved have seen how that can work because there is a leap of faith and there's a leap of faith that no amount of data or no amount of AB testing or no amount of rationalizing or no amount of spreadsheet math to figure out the ROI of what you're doing will ever help you. It's just not. I just noticed that pattern over and over that there was just a slightly irrational belief in the power of what it would take to have a nine craft level product versus a seven craft level product or six craft level product. I think that that's another component. I have a couple more in depth like that.

(00:36:10):
Definitely the leadership is coherent, so that's walking the walk, talking the talk and I think this is one of the most fascinating ones because it's very much about being who you are and not being embarrassed about that thing. There are companies probably all know that outspoken, domineering believe that the company just should be run a certain way and they set this vibe, this coherent ... that their actions and words match together. When you think about it that way, it makes more sense. The company that's like, "Oh, well we want to empower our teams and do whatever and we believe in our customers," and their actions don't match those particular things, that's not very, very coherent to do these particular things. I think that that's one, the coherent things.

(00:37:06):
Okay, so you've got those high level ones. I think you can definitely add skills and experience. I mean, those definitely matter. I think one thing that happens a lot is how the company views its skills. Here's a challenge we had in Amplitude, just sharing this, is you could view Amplitude as just another B2B SaaS company or maybe just an analytics company. But one of the challenges we had when it was how to build our team is to think about where do you draw the line between someone who's just done B2B SaaS for the last 10 years, is a pro at what they're doing and then how someone could embrace this kind of weird problem, sort of bottom-up motion, top-down motion. It's in product, it's a messy space. You need to be more strategic to do that so the skills need to be mediated obviously between the environment to do those things.

(00:37:51):
Then like all the other, they know how to build software, things don't break, they can experiment without risks. I don't know. They have positive habits. I could go on and on. Hopefully this is helpful just hearing my thought process to go through these things. But I think that the TLDR of this whole thing is those top ones I mentioned seem like common sense and it's like how do you put it in motion in your company? I was just reading that working backwards book about Amazon and they're in this chapter about basically their bar raisers thing and I share it with my partner who's the head of HR at a company. She's like, "Yeah, this is sort of common sense hiring. They're just talking about de-biasing the hiring and having standards and having those linked into the jobs and just not rushing it."

(00:38:41):
It's like these things that seem so common sense are actually hard with what they're doing. I don't know if you've noticed that, but it's like a lot of the advice is common sense. That doesn't mean it's easy to put in motion.

Lenny (00:38:53):
Yeah, and there's also a lot of power to just making it a very important value to the company. Just calling it bar raisers-

John Cutler (00:39:02):
[inaudible 00:39:02]. I'll use the example of a company. I mentioned this company AppFolio here in Santa Barbara, but Klaus and Jon who founded that company, it's just a gem of a company, it's an amazing vertical B2B SaaS company. But I think in the story that they tell us when they started AppFolio, they're like, "We want to find a place where the money flows and we want to be really close to customers and we just want to ..." Well, they were engineers who had seen the light around customer development, just getting close to customers, just being in service to the customers, not just gold plating every technical decision you did. They bought in early to the ideas of test-driven development, pair programming because they believe that the quality ... you should never be worried about the quality. They just believe that quality wasn't something you sacrifice as the norm. It's just got to work.

(00:39:51):
They believed that was possible and when you think about it, those things are always debated. Like, "Oh, should we get technical debt or not? Or how much customer contact is it not?" These two founders basically are like, "That's it. We don't sacrifice on those things." They've done really well with that.

Lenny (00:40:08):
That's a thread I want to actually follow up on, is just the power of culture and values and things like that. But before we do that, let me just summarize maybe the top five attributes and kind of traits you just shared and then I have a two part question around this. I wrote these down. Basically the things you've found are true for the companies that seem to be best at building product and software and running product teams. One is coherence between what they're doing and what their strategy is. Two is strong opinions loosely held. Three is belief in the power of product. Four is the leadership is coherent, that their advice matches their words and their actions. Then five is just the necessary skills and experience in building stuff they're building.

John Cutler (00:40:51):
Contextual skills too. Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:40:54):
Kind of a two part question. One is if there's a pie chart of what contributes to this working out, what percentage would you say is just the people that they hire that contributes to them succeeding here? Then related question is just like can you change a team to be high performing? Does that happen or is it often just like this is just the way they are and their culture and their founders are this way and it's really hard?

John Cutler (00:41:18):
The pie chart, that's the problem. I mean, that is the trillion dollar question so I don't really have an answer. I have a couple thoughts on it. What do we know? We know that you can have a bunch of geniuses in the room and if there's not coherent leadership and there's not coherent structure in what you're doing, they'll fail. Okay, so we know there's a limit on one side of this particular problem and we know on the other side of the problem is if no one's done this before, who knows? Because how many startups were started by people who hadn't done it before, who had passion for doing something? Now, they made a lot of mistakes. Now, granted people would say, "All right, now after three failures, I'm going to tell you what we need to do to succeed," so maybe they have to fail a couple times to do that.

(00:42:03):
With the right things in motion, you can do that. Also, another data point. At a lot of companies that are known to be higher performing, they're one of two categories. Either everyone in the company is this extremely vetted genius at what they're doing, or they have a culture where people stay for three, four, five, six years, they build their career or seven, eight, nine years. There is a concentration of people who are very skilled, but they have a knack for bringing people up. They have a knack for taking someone who has some of the raw materials to be able to do it and making them really good at their job to be able to do it. I'm not going to throw out a percentage point into it. I'm just going to note that I think that the biggest challenge is that we all need to challenge our biases.

(00:42:46):
I do too. Four or five years ago, I would've said, well, personal skill's nothing. It's all the environment. There's people on Twitter who do this all the time. They're like, "Bad management kills everything. Skills aren't important. You should just be able to do anything with anyone." I used to be one of those particular people and I also have this sort of humanist bent to what I'm doing, and so I very much want to believe ... I'm always the person that's like, "Oh, we should give them the seventh chance." I know myself right to do that and I would suggest that there's people on the other end of the spectrum who could benefit from shifting a little bit to embrace some other ideas too. They're the people who are like, "Well, it's 100% their skill. We will hire complete A plus players all a particular time. Everything will work out as expected." Or they trace everything back to leadership anyway. So when anything's wrong, they're like, "Well, this happened under this person's watch, therefore they are a failure."

(00:43:37):
But how many companies in general will hire a string of highly qualified people into a particular department and then fail each particular time? I don't know. I don't have the answer for you on that one, but I think that everyone can benefit from challenging maybe their happy place, me included [inaudible 00:43:57].

Lenny (00:43:57):
I like that. It's like it's an optimistic perspective basically and anyone can change, anyone can improve. Don't assume that it's just not possible.

John Cutler (00:44:05):
And give it a shot and then can you create a coherent environment where maybe that could happen. Frankly, we're maybe getting into this later, there's a lot of companies that were flying high and are not flying high anymore. High performance is not this state you achieve. It's actually a continuum that you're always ... we have this in our personal lives too. We're flying high and we think we do everything and then we get to that point and then we go back down into feeling we don't know anything again and we feel those lows. That's kind of how I think about that particular thing.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. But getting SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.

(00:45:24):
Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners, get $1,000 off Vanta.

(00:45:55):
Coming back to the first question about people, and maybe you just answered this, but do you find that it's all about the people and who you hire and may be at the top that lead to the result at the company? Or you're saying it's sometimes the right amazing people? Sometimes it's the process, sometimes it's the market, [inaudible 00:46:12]

John Cutler (00:46:12):
It's the latter and I think that's why I called the damn thing the beautiful mess. Because I think we all have confirmation bias. We'll point to that company and say ... I mean, let me just use an example. Satya Nadella and Microsoft. You could argue you obviously have someone who's this very humble, very capable leader in that particular thing. But I imagine that at some point in the future there'll be books written about that and they'll say like, "Hey, it was kind of that. But you know what he did? He got rid of some bad people and created the air cover and set in motion the couple of strategic imperatives that we're going to let the things going." Now imagine Microsoft didn't have all the wealth of talent that it had, or all the wealth of structures or the good parts of the tradition, or let's say the bad parts served them well for a long time, but maybe they started to become a little bit outdated and then they were putting them in a competitively bad situation.

(00:47:07):
Even that situation, you can idolize that particular leader for doing it, but there's many things that could happen to be able to do that. There's this idea of great man theory, and this is something I talk about a lot where in great man theory success is the result of these highly influential, highly effective men, in a lot of cases, and that you can explain history through these heroic men. That's sort of a thing. A lot of people base history on doing that. I think that this, again, just the other perspective here is that things are a lot messier and you can't just trace everything to these sort of single heroes men in many cases that make it happen. I'm just presenting both sides of it as we kind of dig into it. I think, though, let's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, "Should I invest more on processes or should I invest more in people?"

(00:47:57):
The first thing is introspection. What do you believe in really? Not just what do I believe in that you think the whole rest of the world ... I think the rules of the world are that blank happens. It's like what do you believe in and what do the people around you believe in and how can you be a coherent leader? You know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy place, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from a process-driven, meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of the consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives. That's just my perspective on it.

Lenny (00:48:49):
That really resonates. It makes me think about companies, especially in the past couple years, that did really well because the market was pulling them and everything was just killing it. They're just growing crazy and you would assume it's the founder, the CEO, that's the result of that. But then when the market tanks, things stop working, and that's a really good, I think, example of just, it's not necessarily the person. Could just be other factors that make it feel like everything's going great.

John Cutler (00:49:16):
And people are great. There are people that have an outsized effect in particular companies. A great example there is people forget that, for example, leaders or CEOs also have a lot of formal structural power at their disposal to be able to change things. So well, there's that great man leaders, genius. They do have more knobs to move, and even then they're not the boss. You know what? There's a board, there's investors. If you talk to any CEO, they'll be like, "You think [inaudible 00:49:47]. I've got people bossing me around too." It's always a mix. That's the way I see it.

Lenny (00:49:54):
Which is why if things don't go well, their ass is on the line.

John Cutler (00:49:58):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (00:49:59):
Coming back to a thought I had as you were talking earlier about values and culture, it's interesting that wasn't on your list of just the power and importance of, I don't know, strong value, strong culture. Have you found that that's just not essential? What are your thoughts on-

John Cutler (00:50:13):
No, I think it's kind of the fabric that creates those other things. It's the fabric that creates coherence. Coherent around what? If culture is what we're doing, is what we're acting and the way we act is sort of a function of some of the belief systems and the culture and the value systems that we have, maybe I just almost take it for granted that that's sitting underneath those particular things. But here's an example where sometimes nuances matter. I'll just use Amplitude. We had some values and we had HOG, humility, and it's this idea of ownership and a growth mindset to do these things.

(00:50:52):
Ownership defined in an individualistic culture is going to look very, very different than ownership defined in a collectivist culture. What I find with companies is that ... and certainly we struggled to communicate this too, and I think we were pretty good at communicating where we sat on this particular thing, but a lot of times people write up these cultural documents and they're just like, "Well, this is our culture. We're into ownership." It's not saying much, saying that you believe in ownership without the addition of ... what we would do successfully and Spencer and other people do successfully is talk about the behaviors that represented that level of ownership, then that tells you something about what the culture is. Maybe when I was answering that, I kind of took that for granted. But there's a set of beliefs and values that sit underneath all those things, I bet.

Lenny (00:51:38):
When you think of the companies you work with over the years, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want, but when you think of the companies with the best culture or the best way, or some of the best companies in terms of how they build product, who comes to mind?

John Cutler (00:51:52):
I will mention some companies, but I'm not going to mention what people think in doing this. I'm just going to mention moments where I was like, "This thing is really clicking," and not because it wasn't easy-

John Cutler (00:52:00):
I was like, this thing is really clicking.

Lenny (00:52:01):
Yeah.

John Cutler (00:52:02):
And not because it wasn't easy, or there is a leader at Lego and her name is Angela. And when I'm talking to her, I'm just like, this person just has it dialed in. This is really hard. This business is transforming. They've got one of the biggest, most iconic brands in the whole world at their hands. And I'm sitting and I'm just going to single out her. Yeah, there's this situation here. It's not easy, it's not great. It's not high performing by any, you take a tiny Silicon Valley company. Yeah, it's hard to be Lego with thousands of people trying to build this and trying to take an iconic brand and turn it into something having to do with digital stuff. But I just want to give a shout out to her.

(00:52:47):
That's what I got to say to this question. I think of it more of these moments where I'm like, "Wow, this shits hard. It's not ideal." And that people are coming to work every day and there's a group of people in this room who are extremely well-meaning. And you know what? The impact of their work might not even be seen in their tenure at that company.

(00:53:06):
Some of these larger companies might take a decade to really work themselves through. And so I don't know, when you asked that question, I thought more about individual moments where I spent time with teams or like that team I mentioned to you in India where it's like everyone's super humble and whatever. So...

Lenny (00:53:21):
Awesome.

John Cutler (00:53:22):
Yeah, I'm not going to give a lot of names.

Lenny (00:53:22):
No, it's great.

John Cutler (00:53:23):
But just shout out Angela. She's doing an awesome job.

Lenny (00:53:25):
Go Angela. That reminds me of something I wanted to ask around the cultural differences between product teams in different countries. You talked about India, you talked about Lego. What have you found to be the main differences in how product teams operate and companies operate across different countries like say California versus Paris versus Australia?

John Cutler (00:53:46):
Yeah. And again, I'm not an expert in this and I think Erin Meyer wrote that or Meyer, I'm not sure how to pronounce her name, wrote that book, The Culture Map. And so you should just find what those people wrote because they're much smarter than I am about this. But here's the individual things that I noticed is definitely the individualist and what I would call almost like communitarian vibe.

(00:54:05):
The idea of individualism versus the idea of the team being sort of a community of people together. So that's one, and you pick up about that a lot when you go to different places. I mean, in the United States you'll find this situation where you've got this one engineering manager and they are brokering the projects with every single engineer on their team and everyone wants the promotion.

(00:54:27):
And there's this whole, instead of the PM working with the team, it's like the PM brokering stuff with an engineering manager to give everyone their premier project. No one's really working together. There's no pair programming. There's nothing like that. That's a whole other debate, but. And so that's highly individualistic and it might work in that particular environment.

(00:54:47):
In fact, it might be optimized for environments where you're burning through people every 18 months or 24 months or... Because you just want to put another cog into the particular machine so that you can grow and so you can do stuff. And that's an extreme example, but then you compare that to other parts of the world, it's much more consensus driven. The team perceives itself as a team having a team goal.

(00:55:08):
They have a team objective. And certainly even in the Bay Area, there's companies that are more the collectivist vibe and the more. So to say that it's just about the world is not really just right. So I think that yeah, the collectivist individualistic thing is important. I do think that certain cultures are much more sort of hierarchically oriented.

(00:55:26):
There's much more deference to the hierarchy in the particular where people are sitting and the information flows in a certain way. And some companies tend to that being more bureaucratic. And then some countries tend to that being like, it's still a tall company, but it's very much like you manager, you own this, you do this. So it's not like rules are flowing from the top down. It's more just a pretty big org chart. So those are some of the things that come to mind, yeah, as we're going through it. So yeah.

Lenny (00:55:55):
This relates a lot to something else. You often talk about that much of the advice on the internet and books, newsletters like ours is geared towards Silicon Valley type tech startups.

John Cutler (00:56:06):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:06):
And in reality, most PMs don't work at companies like that. A lot of them are going through transformations.

John Cutler (00:56:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:56:11):
They're trying to transform the way their culture works. And I imagine a lot of companies you work with are trying to get to that point and that just a lot of advice doesn't actually work for them. What have you found along those lines of just companies going through this and things you've learned there?

John Cutler (00:56:24):
So putting myself in the shoes of those particular companies, like I said, I think some of my most rewarding interactions have been with these non Silicon Valley companies. I certainly learn a lot when I talk to companies in the Bay Area and in the United States to do those particular things.

(00:56:41):
I think that the first thing to keep in mind is that those, let's just take these bigger companies for a second, big enterprise companies. Part of the thing is just realizing how much inertia they're up against when you're chatting them. So I do believe that there's some structural things that probably they could avoid, but then there's also just structural things that are just part of the game to do that.

(00:57:11):
So they'll be in situations where maybe none of the executives have shipped product before. They also assume that there's only one way to do things. Certainly in a lot of high performing companies, I have friends who will go and work at those companies. They're like, "Oh no, no one changes the rules here. We just do it this way at Amazon or we just do it," whatever.

(00:57:29):
So this similar thing happens in these particular companies, like there's only one way to do things. They've got these crazy annual budgeting cycles and planning cycles, or maybe there's a big IT industrial complex that they're sort of trying to transform into doing these things. So anyway, my point is, is that they, so many of these companies just have structural things that make it very difficult to just immediately convert that particular advice as they're doing that.

(00:57:59):
So I think the first thing that comes to mind with that is how to adapt that advice maybe for some of those larger kind of transforming companies. And I think that the couple things that I sort of remark on is that one, reps matter in those particular situations. So in many of those companies, they should focus on creating these sort of areas or pods where a company can, a team can get in the reps that they're trying to be able to do.

(00:58:29):
So it's sort of a little miniature version of that. And there's a whole problem with innovation labs. There's a whole problem with that kind of idea. But the idea that you can create these little bastions where a team can get in the reps is important.

Lenny (00:58:41):
And reps meaning shipping, shipping product.

John Cutler (00:58:43):
Shipping and learning, going through the full loop. Can they go through the full loop of what they're doing? And I think that the other thing that comes up with that is that most of those companies need to think of frameworks appropriately.

(00:58:57):
They'll read about these particular frameworks or what particular companies do or don't do. And I think that for a lot of those companies, they see adopting the frameworks as the end goal. They kind of look there. And sometimes maybe even you write a post, it's like, "Well, how does Figma work?" And they're like, "We use these frameworks."

Lenny (00:58:57):
Yeah.

John Cutler (00:59:15):
And so this company's like, "Well, we've got to use these framework." And I think that the way that I tend to think about frameworks is that they're more like a job aid. They're more like a learning tool that the team kind of uses to keep themself on track. But part of the thing is that those companies will reinvent the things they're using when things aren't working out.

(00:59:34):
So I think that that's another thing maybe some of those companies could benefit from doing, where we're getting kind of more into the kind of digital transformation or the big company space. But I think back to that particular question, I think you need to view a lot of advice coming from Silicon Valley just contextually. It's startup. There's a tradition of how these companies work. Many of them are just optimized very much for that first big arc of growth.

(00:59:58):
They've never really been disrupted. The only disruption has come from scale, not from being a legacy, a huge global brand or huge global business, and then being disrupted by new things. The only problems, not the only because it's really hard, but the problems have been primarily scaling. So they're kind of optimized for wrapping their head around that.

(01:00:20):
And then many of them are just pure digital product companies. And so I think this is a thing that a lot of the big rideshare and food delivery conglomerates are figuring out. They're like, " Oh, this is a lot harder than we thought." When you're dealing with moving people around and logistics and things, it's an order of magnitude more complex to do that.

(01:00:42):
So I don't know if that helps kind of explain my perspective on that, but I think that it's like you have to adapt the advice and you also need to acknowledge that for some of these companies there are these sort of just structural areas of inertia that they're trying to work through and that a lot of them maybe need to adapt this advice on the small instead of thinking they're just going to install all the frameworks or install everything they're doing.

Lenny (01:01:02):
Yeah, this is really, really good advice. I imagine folks are listening that may be working at a company like that. It feels like there's two sides to it. One is there should just be an awareness of this may not work at us, we're not going to be Figma.

John Cutler (01:01:02):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:01:15):
And let's just get used to that. And then two, this good reflection for me that I'm probably causing some damage with people reading a post on here's how Figma builds product. And then not adding a little bit of, maybe this won't work at your company.

John Cutler (01:01:29):
But maybe it can. And I talk about this a lot, this sort of I do believe there's sort of this fundamental attribution bias at play where people in these high performings don't acknowledge the amount that luck and inertia has been a part of what they're doing. And that the people in the big companies, or these not, these companies that believe that it's not the way that they can do that actually overestimate the kind of systemic drag in their organization and underestimate what can be possible.

(01:01:57):
And you think about that, we do that a lot in just our lives in general. We see someone being really successful and we'll say, "Well, but my situation is this." And when things are working for us, we're like, "I'm a genius. I'm a genius doing this particular thing." When things work, we're competent. When things don't, it's like the system and everyone else's incompetence to be able to do it.

(01:02:18):
So I do think that there's opportunities. I think there's another thing too, that there's a vast spectrum of companies. We paint some of these large enterprises on one end of the spectrum and then these other company, these modern product companies. But I brought up that plumbing company in Australia. You meet these companies, you know what? Their revenue is literally 50 startups. They are not doing bad. They are not doing bad.

(01:02:44):
And you know what? They're actually doing interesting things. One of Amplitude's customers, Anheuser-Busch has this thing called BEES. And BEES is basically a liquor distribution app. And it's literally one of the biggest B2B companies in the world. And you know what? Anheuser-Busch, it's like what? We're going to distribute beer because the pandemic. And so we're going to have, and I think actually they started to become more even used for logistics.

(01:03:06):
You're a bodega in one of those countries, you can order beer for doing it. So I think that we tend to kind of paint this world of, there's the big smoke companies and then there's the fast nimble companies, but there's everything in between. Another example is a lot of tech companies started 2000 to 2008, kind of are on their third or fourth act at the moment, second or third or fourth act, bought a lot of companies, they're trying to absorb them.

(01:03:33):
They might be trying a product-led growth motion by spanning all the different acquisitions they had. You know what? They are on top of their game. This is not a slouch company, but it's really hard for them to do that. Or we at Amplitude, we'd have a lot of, not old FinTech, but not newest companies. They're printing money and they're just embracing this particular thing. And then compare that to, I did a big Northstar session or more of a coaching session at NewBank in Brazil when there was just 15 people in a room and now they're massive.

(01:04:06):
So I think that we tend to paint things as a form of modern product adoption. There's the high performing companies and the low performing companies when in fact there's just a whole plethora and diversity of different companies riding different waves, adopting different things at different times. And many of them doing really wholesome, humble, good work, just dealing with their circumstances at the particular time.

(01:04:33):
So I think everyone should absolutely know how Figma works, for example. And then we need to try to boost the stories of Angela and her team or some of these companies that you'd never even expect. There's a company here in Santa Barbara that's like, they do refrigeration, use AI to refrigerate industrial facilities. And Carrie, who's the leader there, that company is one of the best leaders I know.

(01:04:57):
And Jesse, who's one of the founders is Harvard PhD student who understands AI doing these things. And I actually would encourage a lot of PMs to think about, look, especially in this economy, what are these unsexy businesses that are kicking butt and small here, it's in sunny Santa Barbara? So I don't know. I think that there's a lot more diversity than just the high performing, low performing spectrum. There's just a whole universe of fun companies out there.

Lenny (01:05:26):
Well, as you were talking, I was thinking about there's a small group of people like you and Marty Kagan and a few other folks that have worked with tons of different and diverse product teams and not just say, Silicon Valley teams. And I'm curious if there's any other names of folks you think listeners should follow if they work at maybe a non-Silicon Valley type team. Marty Kagan is who comes to mind first, but I don't know if you have anyone else. And if not, that's all good.

John Cutler (01:05:52):
Well, yeah, there's a couple people, but I feel like I should go back and just generate this full list for people. Maybe it would be interesting. Maybe I'll take that as an action item to...

Lenny (01:06:00):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:06:01):
List a couple of these.

Lenny (01:06:01):
We'll put it in the show notes.

John Cutler (01:06:02):
And I'll give you an example of one guy, and his name is John Smart, and he wrote this book called Better, Sooner, Safer, Happier. And he, I think he was at Barclays Bank. I think that's how you say it in England. And what, he led this transformation. And then I think he's gone on to, he has a consultancy now for doing things. And the guy is just awesome to talk to.

(01:06:27):
He's really, really humble about what the thing book, the book is really interesting. And the thing that I noticed when talking to John is the order of magnitude of complexity of problems that has unraveled and what he had to put in motion to take an old school bank and at least try to get some part of some kind of transformation working in that particular company, I think there's a whole realm of people like that. And I'm going to list a, maybe I'll follow up with a couple more lists of people.

Lenny (01:06:57):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:06:58):
Who can do that. And then I do think there's the people like Teresa Torres and others that have come up with a technique that is universal. You can teach an element of product thinking with her techniques or this opportunity solution tree or this continuous discovery thing that everyone can find accessible no matter where your company is at. And I have a lot of respect for those types of techniques because they're more universal versus some very arcane niche activity.

Lenny (01:07:36):
Awesome. Cool. And then we'll do our best to include whatever full list you come up with in the show notes.

John Cutler (01:07:41):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:42):
So I've been asking a lot of very specific questions. I want to give us a chance to kind of zoom out a little bit.

John Cutler (01:07:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:47):
And see what other advice you may have for product managers and the product community broadly. It feels like you're in this kind of reflective phase after working with all these companies and you take time, you have more time to think. So I'm curious what comes to mind when you think of just, here's advice I have to share.

John Cutler (01:08:04):
Yeah. I think kind of going back to the reps thing, I think that there's this fire hose of amazing information that's out there and I contributed to it and you contribute to it. And there's just, I mean, think what a time to be alive. You can literally just.

Lenny (01:08:04):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:19):
Get these podcasts going. You can listen to anything you want.

Lenny (01:08:22):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:23):
That's pretty amazing. And I was thinking to myself the joke as I saw you put this thing about Andrew Huberman about who gives these sort of life hacks thing. It's like there is absolutely a place for this type of content. I just want someone to summarize what the hell I should do when I wake up in the morning.

Lenny (01:08:38):
Right. Cold plunge.

John Cutler (01:08:39):
Can I be healthier.

Lenny (01:08:40):
Sunlight. Yeah.

John Cutler (01:08:41):
Yeah. I got my sunlight. I went from my sunlight before screens to prepare for our talk today.

Lenny (01:08:47):
Wait, actually?

John Cutler (01:08:47):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:08:48):
That's great.

John Cutler (01:08:49):
I have it in my habit tracker, sunlight before screens every day. Yeah, I got my watch that I got a couple, I'm on vacation. I'm between jobs now. So it's about all health.

Lenny (01:08:59):
Yeah. Optimizing.

John Cutler (01:09:02):
But I think that you need to keep in mind that this is a skill and skill is knowledge times practice mediated by your environment, the habits you form and the motivation that you have and the particular things. And so I think that I learned about that a lot working with learning experience designers in Amplitude that we tend to think that this is just a function of the knowledge that we pick up and the number of podcasts that we listen to. But really it's about going through this loop. So in Amplitude, we have this data informed product loop that we would teach, and it's basically, you need a strategy, you need to develop qualitative models, you need to add measurement to those models. So Northstar framework would be an example of a qualitative model. You need to add measurement to those models, figure out how you're doing it.

(01:09:48):
You need to prioritize where to focus. You need to design bets, you need to measure the impact of those bets. And then you need to circulate what you learned back into the strategy, back into your models, back into how you prioritize, et cetera. And it helps you figure out where you're kind of weak at the moment.

(01:10:02):
So for example, you need a strategy. Without that, nothing is possible. But you could have an amazing strategy and you don't deploy it with the right models, no one can prioritize them. We could do all that right, but you don't design any bets and can't ship anything. Oh, that's kind of a problem. But you could do all that right and you don't know the impact of anything you ship.

(01:10:18):
But you could even do all that right and not circulate the learning back in your company and then you're still not going to succeed in these things. So that's an example of when I mean by the loop. And so one thing you could think about for your career that I think people should focus on, and also in terms of sharing the content that they share.

(01:10:33):
So we're sharing a lot of content around knowledge and job aids, knowledge and job aids, and maybe a little bit of motivation, like how did that person succeed and do that and... But if you think about your career, just think about how many times can you get around that loop and what are you putting, because I worry that people are loaded up with knowledge and feel almost... I meet some of these leaders and they feel beaten up by the advice industry.

(01:11:03):
They feel beaten up that they can never be good enough. They cannot be like whatever company, or they feel like their company's never good enough, like they can't empower their team, they just can't follow anyone's advice. And so I think people are beating themselves up when I think that you shift for some people to focus to taking that knowledge and just getting that loop going for your teams or getting that loop going for your career or getting that loop going for your company is probably a pretty safe bet. So I would think that that's one thing that comes to mind.

Lenny (01:11:31):
Partly being responsible for some of that is what I...

John Cutler (01:11:34):
Yeah, me too.

Lenny (01:11:35):
My advice to people is don't feel like you need to read everything coming across your plate.

John Cutler (01:11:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:11:40):
It's instead wait for the moment when you need that thing. I'm working on SEO right now. Cool.

John Cutler (01:11:40):
Perfect.

Lenny (01:11:45):
I saved that thing about SEO, I'm going to go do it. Just like a just in time learning because you learn it so much better and like, "Oh, shit. I have to load all the stuff in my head in case it becomes useful."

John Cutler (01:11:53):
Absolutely. And I think one thing you think of is think about the podcast you listen to and think about that content is almost like you don't know what you don't know often. So I think that the challenge is, is that if you've been doing PM for a while, product management for a while, you don't really, I don't fit everything in my head.

(01:12:13):
I just, for example, pricing. I know pricing is a thing. I know that there's some people are amazing at pricing. I know that if someone told me like, "Well, you should just price it like this," my spidey sense would say, "You don't know what you're talking about because I know that there's more to it than just what you just said." You develop your spidey sense for things and you know that there's people. You have to dip your toes in understanding. That's the beauty of podcasts, your mind can get blown and then it puts in the back of your brain. You're like, there are some people who know a lot about that versus the founder who believes that they're going to figure everything out for themselves and is just like, no, it's actually a thing.

(01:12:47):
Pricing is a thing or you know what? Meeting design is a thing. There's people who obsess about it or service design is a thing or interaction design or strategy [inaudible 01:12:56]. So that's building on what you said, I think that there is a, especially if you're starting out, there is a definite value of almost seeing the 501 level courses or hearing that genius lecturer.

(01:13:07):
When you're in college as a freshman, I remember, I dropped out, but you would see the genius professor and you wouldn't understand any of it, but you'd know it's a thing and then it helped you guide the way you're doing. So I think that you should kind of balance out those things. But to your point, at the end of the day, you got to just put this stuff in motion somehow.

Lenny (01:13:25):
Yeah.

John Cutler (01:13:26):
How to do it.

Lenny (01:13:26):
And then just know that it's there when you need it. Find some way to store it.

John Cutler (01:13:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:30):
Save it. Maybe even just assume Google will find it for you.

John Cutler (01:13:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:33):
One more question along that same thread is you talked about the importance of going through these loops. At some companies, you just can't really, the company moves slowly, it's super waterfall, they plan really long. Do you have any advice for someone that's like, "Oh, I want to go through loops more often? This is really good advice."

John Cutler (01:13:47):
Point number one is you often underestimate what loops are available to you in that company. They throw up their hands. I've tried to mentor people like this and I think we've done a decent job, but the first thing I'm like, "Just don't throw up your hands and say it's all going to shit." Just at least document what was the.

(01:14:03):
So even if someone from on high says, "Build X," you can at least say, "You know what? Selected option is X. What would the one-pager look like if X was one of five options?" Write the one-pager. Go and talk to that executive and say, "Look, I know you've told me to do this, but what would we observe if this was working versus not working? I'm here to help you with that."

(01:14:27):
Great. You've got some metrics along [inaudible 01:14:29] is what you're doing. Just nudge it. Just one little thing. Hey, nothing's stopping you from writing down all the potential assumptions and risks that you have. Even if someone's like, "Forget all that, you're just going to build the thing." You've gone through the motions for doing it.

(01:14:44):
And I think people underestimate that because the environments are kind of feel like stellifying, I guess is one word, or stilted. And so they just sort of throw up their hands. But I would say that work with what you've got, because the last thing you want is to have a job opportunity two or three years from then and all you can do is shrug your shoulders and say, "I worked at a fucked up. I worked at a messed up company."

Lenny (01:15:09):
You can curse. It's all good.

John Cutler (01:15:10):
Yeah. Well, yeah. So you, "I worked at a messed up company. It was all shit." You're not really honoring yourself for doing that. So I'd say that that's my point about the fundamental attribution bias. Is it hard? Yes. Is it easier in those Silicon Valley companies? Well, maybe not. Maybe those are a shit show too. I've talked to plenty of them that are shit shows.

(01:15:28):
But do you have an opportunity to kind of nudge things forward in your space? Probably. And bring to the systems thing, is it true that some people don't have the privilege of leaving their company for whatever reason? That is true also. So many things can be true, but that doesn't mean that you can't try, I think to kind of almost write your portfolio as you go. Because if you wait two years, you're going to think it was just all a blur and messed up. Whereas the opportunities might be there in your day-to-day as you're working through.

Lenny (01:15:55):
I love how much your advice is optimistic and empowering and not just, "That's the way it is." And...

John Cutler (01:16:00):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:16:02):
And your point about how top tier companies can also be messed up and everything could be going to shit is very true. Especially a hyper-growth company where you're just...

John Cutler (01:16:11):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:16:11):
Constantly changing. It's also very chaotic and things are just breaking all the time.

John Cutler (01:16:16):
And there's people too who just assume it just has to be that way. I would say that one model that I use is the sort of the chronic and acute challenges of the companies. And especially in the last year, you meet a bunch of companies dealing with the same economic conditions. And I will tell you, no, not all companies are equally dysfunctional.

(01:16:34):
And no, not all high performing companies are equally beautiful in all roses. Legitimately some companies work down the chronic issues, which allows them to face the acute stressors, and other companies are just mired in acute issues to do those things. So it's kind of, again, both things can be true. It's like, yeah, there's nothing perfect in product. However, it is true that some companies are healthier than others.

(01:16:58):
An example of that is the companies that leaned in to responding to the pandemic instead of counting the days until it was over. Massive difference. I've seen this over and over, probably with 15 to 20 companies. The companies that were intentional in designing their response to the pandemic versus being like, "Just let managers deal with it, whatever, we're just going to sort it out," have had an order of magnitude better.

(01:17:22):
Now maybe the share price hasn't necessarily reflected it, but the happiness of the people there, they're going to come out of this stronger than the companies that were just like, "It's going to go back to normal and we're going to delay all these org design decisions until some future date." So I don't know if that tells you about high performing, but it's like the high performing companies saw the threat of what existed and then took deliberate steps, coherent steps to frame what their response would be. So that's just an example of that.

Lenny (01:17:54):
Awesome. I took us off track a little bit. I think you were going to go onto a second piece of advice.

John Cutler (01:18:00):
Yeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one, definitely slightly annoy.

John Cutler (01:18:00):
Yeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one definitely slightly annoying to me recently... I'll just get into the stuff that annoys me is that-

Lenny (01:18:06):
Let's do it.

John Cutler (01:18:07):
I personally don't think, I used to use words a lot, like product sense and product mindset and product things like that. I'm personally trying to do a better job this year about trying to unpack those things as legitimate skills and competencies. So if you think about product sense, what is it? Might be the ability to model problems, systems thinking, decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, facilitation tools that you have the ability to look at a competitive ecosystem and maybe see a thing and yeah, maybe there's a little bit of sense to it. It's like, "I want to help customers," or whatever. But I think that I'm trying to make a concerted effort to unpack those things into things that could be taught.

(01:18:50):
And that's going to certainly be part of my role at toast. The last thing I want to do is be like you have a product mindset or you don't. A great example, I was even talking with Craig just the other day and we were talking about how in some environments there's this should/can divide, which I really like, which is some people are just locked into the can. They're uber pragmatic people, so it's like, "Can we do this? Is it possible, given the debt, whatever constraints that you have?" And then there's people who for some reason go in and say, "Should we do it? What should we do here? If those things were not an issue, what should we do?" So it's very easy to... I joked with Craig, it's like it's so easy to go down the path of being like, "Well there's can people and should people, there's high agency people and low agency people, there's this person and that person."

(01:19:44):
It's much more interesting to go and be like, "Yeah, there might be a little bit of a personality component to it, but what skills is the should person bringing to bear on that particular situation?" Maybe it's a level of systems thinking, maybe it's a level of looking at the environment and being able to decouple the current tactics from maybe the optimal tactics for doing it. So that's one thing that I'm excited about, to do that. And yeah, there's a bunch of other things. The diverse perspectives, diverse mental models, maybe working with someone like you to try to raise up some of this more diverse... I really want someone to be like who's working at some company X, to be able to go and say, " Now that leader I can relate to, they're dealing with certain challenges that we are having to deal with at our company," and I'd love them to be able to have role models like that.

Lenny (01:20:41):
Like highlight people that aren't on Twitter that are doing the work.

John Cutler (01:20:46):
And not like meeting here. Not any of these particular people where they can say, "Well that leader..." I was speaking to someone recently, I wrote about this in my newsletter and she was just sort of forlorn. She was like, "I follow these people in this space and I know what my beliefs are and I know that that person has beliefs that I'm not sure vibing with completely. But the message to me is, the only way to get ahead in tech is to have those beliefs. And John, is that right? Do you need to believe this?" In this case, it was this very individualistic, very meritocratic kind of get ahead, push ahead type of vibe, which I respect that thought leader for putting out there, but this person didn't buy into it, which would've all been okay except she said, "Is there a place for me in this environment. Will I need to sacrifice my beliefs to get ahead?"

(01:21:42):
And I told her about some companies that I know. I told her about Carrie, who I just mentioned, who's been working on building the diversity, even in a small company. I told her about different leaders in different companies that, "Hey, there's some companies where it is a real team vibe and there's some companies that that", and she was like, "That's really good to know. So I think that that's one thing I want to work on in the next year, to make sure that people have role models and not the people talking like me, but actual... Maybe I could be a role model to people in my new role, but ideally there's role model leaders who they can relate to. That would be great.

Lenny (01:22:16):
Awesome. I love that. I feel like you just talking about that makes an impact there. Something I'm definitely trying to do with this podcast is not just have all the same people that we see on Twitter all day and have a lot of people people have never heard of, but if you have suggestions, let's definitely talk offline. I'd love to do more and more of this.

John Cutler (01:22:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:22:33):
So those are clearly some of the things on your mind as you're kind of in this period of reflection. I'm curious if you are going to keep writing and keep your newsletter up, maybe publish more books and then just broadly, how do you make time, while you have a day job, to write? Because a lot of people always wonder that. I'm curious if you have any pieces of advice.

John Cutler (01:22:54):
I'm obsessed with the writing, obviously, and I think a bit of background about me is I was pretty involved in music and song writing and it was similar kind of thing, I just liked writing lots of songs. I like that there's a certain buzz you get when you're creating. And in the case of music, it'd be like you record the demo and you get it out there. I think what people have correctly picked up on is because I have a full-time job, sometimes it'll be Thursday night and my kid's finally asleep and it's one in the morning and I'm just like, "I've got to write this post." And so sometimes it comes off as being a little bit rough or even accentuating the fact that I don't give them an answer because it's like two o'clock in the morning now and I don't want to give them an answer. I want to go to sleep to do these things.

(01:23:43):
So I think one of the things I'm going to hope to do is maybe be more deliberate about trying to provide at least maybe some mental models for dealing with the mess. I mean there's things like that out there. There's this thing [inaudible 01:23:57], which is a way to understand the systems and decision-making problems have, are you dealing with a clear system, a complicated system, a complex system, or a chaotic system? And I like things like that because that helps do two things I like. One, I want to give people something actionable to be able to address what they're doing, but it doesn't remove the complexity in the particular situation. So I have role models in that. This guy, Simon Wardly does this kind of mapping, which I think is great. There's these other techniques that I want to try to lean into and maybe develop some of my own that sort of help people have something actionable and embrace the mess, if that makes sense.

(01:24:41):
So for example, I recently wrote about something called the leadership, the Pyramid of Leadership, self awareness. And it's a simple model, but it goes deep how I want it to go deep. So the idea is that at first we know nothing about ourself and then the next level is that we start to become self-aware, but believe the whole world is wired just like we're wired. And then you go up to the next level and you believe that the world thinks different things, but you still think your way is the best way to be able to do that. So an example is, I remember talking to an executive and they're like, "People only stay because of their managers and because of their money. That's it." And I said, "Everyone?" They said, "Yes." "Do you believe that?" "Yes, because everyone believes it. It's a physical law of light." And here I am like, "Oh my God, I joined a company because the mission of the company or whatever."

(01:25:23):
So they're kind of stuck down on that second level where they believe that, "Yeah, the world thinks different things, but I'm absolutely right." And then as you get up to the top, you become a little bit more aware that there's other valid views and then at the top you're sort of like, "No, you don't dishonor yourself and throw away who you are, but you realize that this is a huge asset in the world, that there's diverse views that you can bring together to do really, really amazing things." So that's an example of some writing I've even done recently where I'm kind of like, it's a complex topic, but I try to make it more actionable to do that. So that's one whole thing. The other thing too is leveraging all the crap that I have. I think it's like 700, 800 posts, maybe 900.

Lenny (01:25:23):
Wow.

John Cutler (01:26:07):
I had this whole blog beforehand that I did it. And then I have these hundreds of images with these frameworks and then it's like 50, 70 talks that I've done floating on YouTube and then there's all the mural boards I made at Amplitude. It's a different model. So I kind of feel like I could pull some of that together to make it more actionable for people, give people almost like a meta guide to Cutler content so that they're not just dropped into me writing something at 1:00 AM and being like, "Oh, just another one of those." Like, "Damn it, you didn't give me an alternative to NPS. This newsletter sucks." I mean, frankly, I would say the same thing too if I just stumbled into the newsletter to do it. So those are a couple things that I'm thinking about for the content, definitely not going to stop doing those, sharing those things and doing that. So yeah, excited about this next year.

(01:26:52):
Also, the question about writing, I mean, one thing with a full-time job where most of my work is internal, obviously I need to respect my team. Again, I go back to that funny thing with Spencer, he is like, "You're writing about Amplitude." I'm like, "No, dude, I'm not writing about Amplitude. It's like every company has that problem." But if I'm working alongside people, I obviously can't be like, "No," I can't say, "Oh, your manager sucks." It's like Craig's going to read that to do that particular thing, but I can, what I'm really excited about is that part of my job will be involving doing a lot of writing and a lot of teaching, is hopefully work it out with the company so that I can share things that are not too specific about the company, but much more. They've got five different businesses at Toast, they've got all these people, so it's going to be a education every day. So I'm hoping to maybe get that inspiring my work in different ways.

Lenny (01:27:40):
Amazing. I imagine you might rename your newsletter The Beautiful Mess, slightly less messy.

John Cutler (01:27:46):
Yeah. Jam and Toast. The Jam and Toast decision. The addition.

Lenny (01:27:50):
Delicious.

John Cutler (01:27:51):
Yeah, there we go. 2023.

Lenny (01:27:52):
Also, as you were talking, I imagined a chat GBT three type chat bot powered by John Cutler content could be something to try.

John Cutler (01:28:01):
Oh, it could be a funny, yeah, I mean I'm sort of obsessed. I like the ChatGPT thing because I like having things, having a developer inspired by Hemmingway debate, a developer inspired by Tolstoy discussing how to resolve a GIT issue. So that's what I've been obsessed by lately is when you know how ChatGPT works, you can actually make it do really funny things. And back to the worldview things, it's actually really effective. This is a very actionable tip, if you feel you're heavily grounded in let's say the, I don't know, maybe you're like a hardcore objectivist or you believe in individualism, you can just type into ChatGPT and say, "Take this situation and interpret it by five different worldviews." And it'll be like, you'll get the humanist view and you'll get the communitarian view and you'll get the collectivist view. You'll do that. So anyway, it's a fun tool for that. It's really cool.

Lenny (01:28:52):
It is awesome. We checked the checkbox talking about AI, very, very hot these days.

John Cutler (01:28:57):
Yep. Score.

Lenny (01:28:57):
Score. One final question before we get to our exciting lightning round, I'm going to come back to the questions that folks asked you on Twitter. And there's a question that I saved up and the question, it was by Jeff Fedor and his question to you, he was, "What have you always wanted to say but couldn't now that you're between gigs?"

John Cutler (01:29:18):
Oh, that's good. So one thing is I didn't really need to filter myself very much when I was at Amplitude, which is kind of the beauty of the gig. I wrote this blog post, probably six years ago called How to Know You're Working in a Feature Factory. And I've always, this has all been my jam. The outcome, outcome and impact focus thing. So it's not like I've really had to hide anything. And so one thing I could say is the power of qualitative data, but even Spencer says that too. He's talking about early on in Amplitude you can rely a lot on qualitative data. So that wouldn't be all that controversial. That's a funny thing. There's not that much, I pretty much say what I say partially under the guise that I'm talking to so many teams. So therefore it's never about Amplitude. Absolutely not.

(01:30:07):
I think the one thing that I would change, I don't think that many people in the company would disagree with me, but one anti pattern I see a lot on the part of implementing analytics is that people go in and undertake this huge implementation. They want to implement all their events, they want to get, they want to treat it like this big project. And again, I don't think it's too controversial internally, but I think I might have been much more adamant to people that's just like use our free plan and get 20 events going and you might wipe them out later, but you don't even know what you don't know yet. You would see these companies that are really qualified companies and it would be a couple months of back and forth of them trying to document every question they have and every metric they need and everything that you had.

(01:31:02):
And I would watch them and I understood why they were doing that, but I really just wanted to shake them, which again, I wouldn't have done this because then I would've been talking about the companies I was talking about every day. I just wanted to shake them and just, "Sit me down with the developers at your company for three hours and let's like Hello world, a couple events here, this is, you could be getting value this whole time." And again, I don't think that people at Amplitude would disagree, but I think that that's, I wasn't going to talk about that all day because that would be sort of belittling customers who do want this big implementation thing. So pretty kind of inside baseball for analytics, but that's one thing that I was thinking about for Jeff.

Lenny (01:31:41):
Awesome. Great answer. Also actionable advice. How about that?

John Cutler (01:31:44):
Yeah, can do. You just need to find it. You just send me a message and say, "Do you have the actionable advice for it?" I probably do somewhere. I just maybe didn't have the time to organize it.

Lenny (01:31:53):
Good tip. You're going to get a lot of DMs. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm just going to go through and whatever comes to mind fire away. Are you ready?

John Cutler (01:32:06):
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Lenny (01:32:07):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

John Cutler (01:32:11):
Yeah, this one's pretty easy because they are fairly similar lately. So I really like the book How to Measure Anything, finding Intangibles or Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business. So that's by Douglas Hubbard. And the reason why I like that is again, at Amplitude the number of people who would come in like, "What are all our competitors measuring? We want to know exactly which metric to measure." And again, I'm laughing with you because I know you have these posts. Here's exactly the metrics that you should track. I really respect those posts and that's the power that you have. That's all really good. But what Hubbard reminds you is why the hell are you measuring things to begin with? It's to reduce uncertainty for critical decisions or to achieve certain objectives that you have. The reason why it's important to read that book is A, you figure out someone who's again, actionable, has thought this through. So he gives you kind of a framework to thinking about it.

(01:33:02):
But B, he really challenges this idea of when making decisions in conditions of uncertainty, you only need to reduce the uncertainty to an acceptable amount to be able to make the next decision that you need to make. And we never have, people are like, "Product is science." It's really an art, like a game that's being played out. You never have complete information to do it. So I think that's a good book to remind people about what... To be more creative and thinking about measurement instead of thinking about measurement and metrics is just about adopting the exact metrics that everyone has and doing that.

(01:33:36):
The second one I think would probably be Accelerate. So Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble, that's just one of the best books in the world about the factors contributing to performance. And it's built on many... It's six, I don't know, it's been out for a while now, 10 years? They did the Dora report, which was their yearly report where they did big surveys, like 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people responding to it. And Nicole Forsgren is an amazing scientist. So they structure their thing correctly. They would have a hypothesis about what is equal to performance and how all these individual practices contribute to it.

(01:34:19):
And then they've updated it over time. And I think that Google bought Dora, I don't know exactly how all the parts came into place, but that book is amazing, just sort of teaching you how to think about the idea of performance because they'll include things like the Western topology, which is your company operating a bureaucracy or... These certain culture elements to it, but then also the practices and things that you're doing. So that's a great book when you're trying to think about, "How do I model performance?" And then it's also an amazing book because you can just literally put the stuff into motion about improving your development practices and things you're doing.

(01:34:58):
And then I think probably the last one, man, I just love this book, this Jeff Patton book about user story mapping. I love what Jeff Patton did. He took this extremely simple idea, which is that you can lay out a customer journey and then organize, take a slice across that journey and develop it. And he gives this pretty basic straightforward method to do it. But I tell you, I'll go into companies like a year after they had Jeff in and learned this and they're still like buzzing about, "Hey, user story map." And it's just, he's a super humble guy and he would never outstate the value of this. He'd be like, "Yeah, it's just a journey map with a couple sticky notes on it." But I always, when someone's new at product management, I'm like, "Hey, this is a deceptively simple book. You'll learn this very basic idea, but it'll teach you a lot about product when I do that." So those are three that come to mind.

Lenny (01:35:50):
Killer suggestions, I love answers of books I've never heard of that seem really amazing. So you check the checkbox there. Thank you. Next question. Favorite other podcast other than the one you're currently on?

John Cutler (01:36:02):
I'm in a... I got a four-year-old. I don't really spend a lot of time... I'm the sort of, I'm such a lightweight, it's like I'll do knowledge project because Shane sent me, you know what I mean? I'll just listen to some, I'll binge things, but I do really like, I've actually been going through old episodes of Maggie Crowley's podcast that she did when she was at Drift. Lots of good guests and I really like Maggie's perspective and I like the guests that she had on there. So sometimes I'll go back to an old podcast. He does these really great memes and stuff, but Jason Knight actually has a fun podcast that I listen to and some of those things. So I think that, but realistically I'm not a huge podcast listener. I'd like to go back to a podcast that hasn't been out for a while, like Maggie's and just sort of catch up on all the guests because I thought that was really good.

Lenny (01:36:52):
Awesome. Jason, we love hearing that. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

John Cutler (01:36:57):
Oh man, again, I have a kid. It's nothing. There's this thing called, there's a show called Sunny Bunnies. It's these fluffy bunnies. That's really good. And then there's this animated series called Booba and he's this funny guy. I like Booba [inaudible 01:37:13].

Lenny (01:37:13):
Great. I'm sure these will be useful to families.

John Cutler (01:37:17):
Hardcore product, movies. Really, those are going to up your game a lot.

Lenny (01:37:22):
Yeah, I'm sure there's something to learn. Two more questions. Favorite interview question that you like to ask folks?

John Cutler (01:37:30):
Oh, so one that I like to do is, I do the behavioral questions like, "Tell me about stuff," but then I'll ask them like, "Imagine I'm interviewing a person you worked with. Now answer in there, tell me about of the same situation." So you'll be like, "Oh, Lenny, tell me about a time that you were faced with adversity and you did this and then you worked with the team to do it. And you would go through it and then you'd answer it.

(01:37:55):
And then maybe in the process of doing that, you mentioned someone you work with and I'll be like, "Now imagine that you're Mary, who you just spoke about, and things, and how would she answer the tell me about thing as it relates to you?" And so I think it can show some really interesting self awareness. Often people answer that question like they are the hero of the story and the other people are the accomplices in it, but then if you challenge them, "What was that story from the perspective of one of the people you worked with?" I think it's really interesting.

Lenny (01:38:21):
Awesome. [inaudible 01:38:23].

John Cutler (01:38:23):
So it is a behavioral question. I do think that's the right way and if you dig enough you can really get the depth of the story, but I do think it's fun to challenge people to see how flexible their thinking could be about that situation. I don't know if that's right from an HR perspective, but I like it.

Lenny (01:38:39):
I like it too. Final question, you mentioned you have kids. What's the best lesson someone taught you about raising kids?

John Cutler (01:38:45):
It's a challenge every day. I just think they operate better when they are fed. The kid as a product is like if you feed the product, then they were just, everything's better. And when you don't, like everything falls apart. So just have snacks with you. That's basically the advice that I have for people.

Lenny (01:39:04):
Very practical. Look at you, actionable advice left and right.

John Cutler (01:39:07):
Yeah. You got it.

Lenny (01:39:09):
John, and I feel comfortable calling you John now, I feel like I just got to know you. You're just like, "I'm John now." We hit our goal of, I think it's going to be the longest episode I've done. This was amazing. John, we've reached the end. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask questions if you want them to? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

John Cutler (01:39:32):
I still am using Twitter a fair amount I think, but LinkedIn could be good. John Cuttlefish on Twitter and then just John Cutler at LinkedIn. Yeah, I think what I would love to hear from people is just send recommendations of people we should hear more from. I think that would be really helpful. Even in the role that I have, I want to start like a guest speaker series to bring people in to talk to our team. And so I think that that would be something that I can work on.

Lenny (01:40:02):
Amazing. John, thank you so much for doing this. I'm really excited for this new adventure that you're on, and I'm excited to maybe follow up maybe in a couple years of just what you've learned from this next phase of life.

John Cutler (01:40:14):
I really enjoyed the show and thank you for having me.

## Transcript

Jonathan Becker (00:00:00):
There's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(00:00:35):
On our creative group, we can come up with mockups, in literally, 1% of the time that it took. And so you still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (00:01:01):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Jonathan Becker. Jonathan is a legend and an OG in the world of performance marketing. On this podcast, we've done deep dives into the many aspects of growth, including SEO, sales, conversion optimization, retention, product led growth, product led sales. But this is the first episode where we get super deep on paid growth. For the past decade plus, Jonathan and his team have planned, built, and executed more than $3.5 billion in paid acquisition budgets for companies like Uber, Asana, Square, Masterclass, Tempur-Pedic, and many more. And they've built their agency, Thrive Digital, into one of the preeminent independent digital marketing agencies. In our conversation, we get real deep into all things paid growth, including what's changed with recent privacy shifts, why focusing on creatives is the new biggest opportunity within paid growth. How to think about attribution, and what's changed there. What to look for in people you hire to run paid growth for you, how AI is already changing how paid growth teams operate, and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Jonathan Becker after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:16):

Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.

Jonathan Becker (00:04:48):
Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.

Lenny (00:04:50):
It's my pleasure. What we're going to be doing with this episode, is we're going to be digging real deep into all things paid growth, which we've never done on this podcast yet. And normally I actually skip this part, but I thought it'd be actually helpful for you to spend a little bit of time to give us a little bit of background on your experience in the space of performance marketing, AKA paid growth, AKA paid ads. You tell us what the right term is for this genre. But yeah, just tell us what you've been up to in this area over the past decade and a half, I think.

Jonathan Becker (00:05:20):
Sure. No, that's a great way to kick things off. And again, thank you for having me here. If I think about it, my experience goes back about 15 years into this space. I started off as a web developer. And as I built and structured websites for people, I became pretty obsessed and fascinated with the fact that you could build landing pages or homepages, or whatever it was. Basically the content on a website, and structure it in a manner where you had the chance to surface in organic, so SEO results more prominently. And as I became a practitioner of SEO, SEO really being my first love of marketing, I started attracting attention and people wanted to hire me on as a freelancer. And what I noticed is that as people started asking me questions like, what was the ROI of our SEO campaign? Or, how do I scale this, or whatnot? The answers to their questions ended up being a lot more aligned with what then was the biggest driver in the paid acquisition world, which was paid search.

(00:06:25):
And so I started experimenting with paid search. And what I found was that it was a tangible format and lever through which we could basically give people the types of results they were expecting from SEO, but that were obfuscated in terms of Google's analysis algorithm from an organic point of view being somewhat intangible. And Google slowly removing a lot of the data early on that allowed you to guess and test more easily. 10 plus years later, what started off as this freelancer consultancy that I started running in a walk-in closet in my old apartment, became 130 people. And we manage about $500 million a year in ad spend for small and large companies, including Uber, Asana, Tempur-Pedic. We've worked with Lululemon. Very exciting companies, mostly from the United States, even though we randomly happen to be based in Vancouver, Canada.

Lenny (00:07:26):
There's a number of threads I'm going to pull on there over the course of our chat. But you mentioned Uber and you told me that you had a crazy story about how you actually landed Uber as a customer. Could you share that?

Jonathan Becker (00:07:35):
I had been running Thrive for a couple years, and it was a very excellent regional agency in Canada with really cool local clients. In 2013, I got invited to go down to the TED conference, which was in Long Beach, California. And my friend Andrew Wilkinson asked me to join him at a dinner that night. I didn't know anybody from the TED community at the time. So we have dinner, and then afterwards as it goes at conferences, there's an after party. And so essentially I hop into a taxi, everybody else sped off in their cars, or however which way they were getting there. And as we're talking to the driver saying, "Hey, we're going to this place, can you take us?" There's a knock on the window and the person outside says, "Hey, I think I'm heading to the same destination. Do you mind if I hop in this car with you?"

(00:08:25):
And so we're like, of course. And I turn to him and I'm like, "I'm Jonathan. I run a 10 person agency out of Vancouver." And he says, "Hey, I'm Garrett Camp. I started a company called Uber." And so ironically, I meet the founder of Uber, the company that is in the process of disrupting the entire taxi industry worldwide in the back of a taxi cab. And what happened next basically changed my career forever. We end up at this party. At the time I was spamming Uber's referral program. Kind of a long story, but essentially I was using paid search to camp out on their branded keywords. And as people would sign up with my confusingly similar snippet to Uber's organic snippet, I was essentially siphoning off referral credits. So I would get $20 every single time someone signed up.

(00:09:18):
And I ended up making tens of thousands of dollars doing this. And so fast-forward, I'm getting a drink at the bar next to Garrett, and in my head I'm like, should I tell him about this? Maybe I can land them as a client. This would be really interesting. And essentially I tell him, I'm like, "Hey, I'm doing this. I'm adding zero value, but this is a loophole in your marketing system, and someone should close it." He essentially is like, "I need to report this to the board, but here's my card, write me what you're doing and we'll contact you." And so I get contacted by a bunch of his lieutenants. If you've read the book, Super Pumped. All the people that we dealt with at the time are in the book, and [inaudible 00:09:58]-

Lenny (00:09:58):
I watched the show.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:00):
Yeah, exactly. And they were like, "Hey, this is bad, you have to stop doing this. But can we hire you to solve the problem?" And so what started off as me running projects for local bars in Vancouver, or clothing stores, or whatever it was. Turned into me landing early stage Uber as a client, and really graduating us from competent professionals to leaders in our sector. And so it was a fascinating project, and we worked with Uber for 10 years.

Lenny (00:10:32):
That is an incredible story. I love the arbitrage game you're running there. It's basically siphoning VC money out of Uber. And I guess the lesson there a little bit is just sometimes it's this interesting combination of hustle in terms of just make some money, and also taking advantage of this opportunity you were plopped into.

Jonathan Becker (00:10:53):
Yeah. I think people often talk about entrepreneurs who have been successful and they comment that they're lucky. Whereas, I actually look at that situation and I think that you have to make your own luck. I could have been like, oh, cool, I met this guy in the back of a taxi and that was it. But I decided to take a risk, being that I could get embarrassed or nothing could happen, or they could shut down this referral gimmicky thing that I was doing. I had very little to lose, I guess, ultimately. But a lot of people just don't make these moves in life because they're nervous, or they're worried too much about what the downside might be. And so I very much was like, I'm going to shoot my shot here. And you put yourself in situations where everybody has luck, but you have to capitalize on it basically. And so that was an example of being willing to take a risk, and it paying off pretty big time I think.

Lenny (00:11:46):
Also, being at Ted, that seems like a good move. Networking, paying off. Love that he was in a taxi, that's hilarious. I was going to ask you about that. And clearly, he's doing some research [inaudible 00:11:55].

Jonathan Becker (00:11:54):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:11:58):
Let's start diving into the world of paid growth. And if you think about just paid growth.. And again, actually, what do you refer to this area as? Paid growth, performance marketing, paid ads?

Jonathan Becker (00:12:08):
There's a lot of interchangeable terms. Performance marketing is a common term. Paid acquisition is a common term. Some people think of those two things as growth marketing, whereas I see growth marketing as a bigger practice area within which paid acquisition sits. And then of course there's subsets, there's social ads, there's paid search, there's programmatic. And so there's a lot of different ways of saying the same thing.

Lenny (00:12:31):
I'm going to use performance marketing. I like that term because it really describes what it is. It's like marketing with you can measure performance. Let's see how that goes. As a channel, it's such an interesting mix of, on the one hand it's this incredible growth lever that allows basically any company to spend money and understand the ROI and acquiring the users. This thing that never existed before. Essentially Facebook and Google created these platforms. On the other hand, there's this sense that it's this drug that you start and then you get hooked on and you can never leave. And there's a lot of advice of just, avoid paid growth. That's just not a good healthy way of growing, especially as a startup. And so my question to you is just, how do you think about that element of it? And then even more specifically, what products do you find paid growth as a channel is right for and not right for?

Jonathan Becker (00:13:24):
Yeah, it's a really great question. And so, I think there's a couple different things that need to be unpacked here. Paid acquisition or performance marketing-

Lenny (00:13:33):
Performance marketing. [inaudible 00:13:35]-

Jonathan Becker (00:13:34):
... you can call it, can be seen as a drug, I suppose, when you are entirely reliant on it to fuel the revenue of your business. The analogy that I try and use here is that it would be very dangerous if I was advising you with your life savings and I told you to put it all in a single stock in the stock market. Stocks can be volatile. And as a result of that, your net worth would fluctuate quite a bit in the short-term and the long-term based on a lot of things that you don't control, like the external markets, or things that are happening within the performance of that particular company that you invested in. When I think about all of the marketing mix, so email, direct mail, linear television, performance, marketing, whatever it is, I think about it as investing capital with the expectation of a return. And in the same manner that I would not take all of your life savings and dump it into a single stock, I don't recommend putting all of your money into a single performance marketing channel, and then somewhat exposing you to the volatility of fluctuating CPCs or changing market conditions. I would agree with you that it is a drug, in a sense, if you have all of your eggs in one basket, and that basket takes you on a very intense rollercoaster in terms of performance. But when I think about the fact that Thrive manages $500 million a year, I think of myself to a extent as a fund manager, we are managing people's money with the expectation of a return. And part of the strategy is to diversify across channels. And so we decrease the reliance of any individual project on a singular channel and its performance.

(00:15:26):
And similarly, I always say to people that the first rule of performance marketing is not to forget about offline marketing and the classic marketing that works for organizations. In other words, direct mail can really work, email marketing works beautifully, SEO can really work. There's all of these wonderful things at your disposal. The real crash and burn scenarios that I've seen are these, not fly by night brands, but brands that figured out... Just like with Uber, I figured out this weird tie-in where I could make free money from their referral system. Sometimes people find shortcuts, hacks if you will, to scale rapidly because of one specific nuance of the Facebook ad platform, or something like that. And what they fail to see is that those loopholes come and go.

(00:16:19):
And so if they scale massively and their entire business is predicated on the performance of this one loophole that they found, or investing everything in a single channel, and then the conditions change, they're not going to be very happy and the business will suffer dramatically. And so when I think about this, it's a responsible channel mix, diversity, and understanding that you can't be overly reliant on performance marketing for the success or failure of your business.

Lenny (00:16:48):
What about the second part of that question of when you think about when companies come to you. What do you look for to help you understand this is going to be a really good fit for performance marketing and this is going to give them a lot of opportunity to growth, versus maybe not, maybe it'll be a small sliver but it's not going to be a massive success for them?

Jonathan Becker (00:17:06):
Yeah. I would say that the answer to that question is different at different stages of a company's life cycle. Early stage, look at what the company is doing, look at your own company. Have you established product market fit? Is this an idea that has yet to be tested, and are they entirely looking to performance marketing to scale everything? Are they at risk of it becoming an over-reliance on performance marketing? At a later stage we look at certain criteria that they might or might not possess. Typically, that will come down to resourcing.

(00:17:43):
The question at a later stage is not, does it work? But, to what scale can it work? And so we are looking at things like, do they have adequate creative resources and buy-in? Does creative resourcing tie into performance, and can we create a feedback loop there around testing? I'll talk to you about that in a bit. Do they have professional marketers on staff? Are there people who have experience doing what we do, that speak our language so to speak? Or is part of this an organizational educational, and creating buy-in through stakeholders process that needs to take place? Do they have technical resources? If we say, "Hey, tracking and attribution is broken, here's how to solve that." Can you implement it? And so on and so forth.

(00:18:27):
There's no one magic formula for what works or what type of company will be successful on performance marketing channels. Just as evidence of this, Google, which I think had a down quarter reported sales this week, and it was $70 billion in three months. And Facebook similarly just recorded yesterday evening, and it was $32 billion. That's $100 billion on just Google and Facebook in three months, and the majority of that revenue is from ads. This works really well for lots of different companies, it's just a question of at what scale.

Lenny (00:19:06):
Just to pull an thread a little bit more. Something I've heard from other guests is that paid ads are best for products where you get basically payback really quickly, basically to feed the flywheel of spend so that you're not sitting around waiting for someone to buy something in the future, or it's a small trickle of pay. How important is that, I guess? Do you find that you could just do paid growth for any company, it doesn't matter their business model? Or is there something you're like, okay, this needs to exist for you to invest serious resources? And even hire that team that you just talked about.

Jonathan Becker (00:19:37):
It's always nice when there's a quick turnaround on investment and return. And that's wonderful for like D2C or e-commerce style businesses where they're essentially taking the revenue to fuel additional inventory and operating costs. However, not all businesses work that way. And so, in a B2C or B2B lead generation scenario, we have to undertake pretty sophisticated modeling around these abstract concepts, like lifetime value. Which is difficult, because most businesses are relatively new that we work with, and so the idea of lifetime value is a misnomer. They don't know what that is yet.

(00:20:15):
But we have to model things like LTV to CAC, so cost per acquisition costs versus lifetime value and the period within which the payback occurs. You end up getting to a pretty sophisticated place where you can build out things like a lead scoring model, which predictively can determine in a statistically significant way the likelihood that one lead will convert to revenue over another. And so there are ways around the slower payback period that still end up being pretty accurate based on what you're bidding on today versus the latent revenue that will be accrued to those campaigns through attribution.

Lenny (00:20:58):
Do you have any just rules of thumb for someone listening and trying to decide, is paid a real model for us, either on LTV or CAC, or payback period? Or something just like, here's what you probably should have, especially early stage for you to feel like paid growth is going to be a great lever for you to use, and maybe a primary lever.

Jonathan Becker (00:21:18):
Product market fit. If you know that your business sells into audiences. Let's say you are a social media influencer or you had a really strong email marketing game, or organically your content surfaces within Google search results. Or, you did a lot of direct mail and linear television and billboard advertising and that worked. If other things work, it is highly likely that paid acquisition will work. The issue for most companies is in this incorrect assumption that the data that is provided through paid channels allows you to have full end-to-end understanding of attribution. Which is wrong, it's never been that way. And the other aspect of this is the patience to understand that every business is unique, and these metrics that we know are important are different for every business. Lifetime value, like propensity to repurchase, ROAS, which is return on amount spent, CPA, CAC, all of these different things are different for every business.

(00:22:24):
Even if I worked with two hotels in the same city, they would have different results based on the nuances of their budget, their brand, the market that they sit within, the services that they offer, and so on and so forth. I think that everything else, the main problem here is that nobody should expect an overnight turnaround with performance marketing. It is a very difficult channel to manage, and that's why people hire experts like us to help them with it because it's a never ending problem with constantly changing issues. It's always been like that, that's not a new thing since pandemic, or whatever. And it will take some time to work out what works.

Lenny (00:23:07):
I have this framework of there's these four growth channels, basically growth engines is what I call them. There's paid/performance marketing. There's SEO, there's virality in their sales. And essentially there's some companies whose growth is almost primarily paid. A few that come to mind are booking.com, which we know well at Airbnb, which is almost all paid growth driven. Credit Karma comes to mind as a classic paid performance marketing. I keep coming to paid growth as my term, so I'm just going to stick with that. TikTok initially was very performance marketing, paid growth oriented. Wish was another one I think about.

(00:23:42):
And I want to talk about how much things are changing within this realm. But before we get there, do you think there's still an opportunity for startups to emerge where they get to scale almost exclusively through performance marketing? And this question actually came from Twitter, someone tweeted this randomly the other day. And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan. And by the way, her name is Liz.

Lenny (00:24:00):
And I was like, oh, that's a great question for Jonathan, and by the way, her name is Liz Georgie asked this question, so there you go.

Jonathan Becker (00:24:06):
I'll put it this way. Every unicorn from the 2010s era that scale did performance marketing, but not everyone during that time who did performance marketing scaled. So I want to remove the bias here that just because all the successful organizations did this didn't mean that it was a magical channel for everyone. We had plenty of projects that we worked on that flatlined during that period. And so the sense that there was a period of time where this was easy or it worked on any project is not correct in my opinion. With that said, we see companies that are spending millions of dollars a month on performance marketing channels like Google and Meta still, despite all the ups and downs that they have faced and they do so profitably.

(00:24:55):
And I think there's some really great examples of companies that have scaled in relatively recent times, almost exclusively through paid. Grammarly is a really good example of this. They have been good at solving for this problem that exists around understanding the cost per acquisition versus lifetime value, how sticky customers are, predicting how much revenue can come from a customer and backing out into therefore how much we can pay per click and per lead and so on and so forth. Athletic Greens is another good example. So Athletic Greens is actually a pretty old company. I think they've been around for 10 years. I think they have retail distribution. I think they have done a lot of the more classic marketing things that are important in terms of developing that channel mix. But I think the amplification of that brand really, really gained traction quite recently where now everybody knows what Athletic Greens is, and that's because they're buying loads of ads on TikTok. They're buying loads of ads on other social channels like Facebook. They're investing in podcasting partnerships. But this is all digital paid acquisition.

(00:26:07):
And so it had a wonderful effect on this really interesting business that they had already built. So yes, it's still doable. We still see people doing it, and I think that there's been a bit of a reckoning in the performance marketing industry pertaining to things like privacy and the changes that Apple made and people being very creeped out at how their data is being used rightfully so. And then obviously the economy in 2022, we had a terrible macroeconomic shift where interest rates rise and inflation's out of control. And so of course the first thing that people cut are typically marketing budgets and we see Facebook and Google and other ad channels directly suffering from that. So all of that said, these storms pass. And so when the economy improves, generally speaking, I imagine people will go back to trying to find as much inventory from a pay per click point of view that they can purchase as possible and figuring out the economics of how to do that.

Lenny (00:27:08):
I was definitely going to ask about that, and I love that you touched on it, just clearly a lot is changing in paid growth/performance marketing recently. You talked about the privacy stuff, you talked about COVID kind of shifted the way people spend and kind of dropped and then came back. So my question is who are you finding has the most success these days in performance marketing? And I will plant one seed, which from the examples you just shared, it feels like it's mostly companies that are very efficient. I think Grammarly, they're just super efficient as a business. And then I think Analytic Greens, they're a sponsor and their negotiations for sponsoring is just like, okay, here's the number that makes sense for them financially, and they're not going to go anywhere above that.

Jonathan Becker (00:27:49):
Yeah. Because they know, they understand how many impressions they'll get and on average what the quality of impression is and how many dollars they can put behind that before it has a cliff in terms of ROI.

Lenny (00:28:05):
Exactly. So broadly, who do you think is having the most success now with the changes and then generally, what should people know about what has changed in the past say year in the space of performance marketing?

Jonathan Becker (00:28:18):
I'm not going to really be able to point to this company is really getting it right and I think that you can do that, but it's like saying, a friend of mine who recently on Twitter tweeted this funny thing where he was like, this is the number that I used to win the lottery said every successful founder ever trying to give advice to other founders. And so in other words, just because they won the lottery doesn't mean you're going to be successful picking the same number.

(00:28:43):
To that extent, there is a bit of a playbook around modern day performance marketing, and that includes everything from really stringent and rigorous creative testing and thinking about that correctly to understanding the subjectivity of attribution and its strengths and weaknesses, doing a lot of work around validity of these campaigns. So really just the measurement and whatnot. Companies that can do those things and then understand their own marketing economics, in other words, quite basically how much can we afford to spend in acquiring a customer on any channel before that acquisition is no longer profitable. So really focusing on the profitability of the bottom line and not just break net growth, for instance. Companies that have those capabilities and see the world that way tend to be successful in performance marketing.

Lenny (00:29:39):
When you were giving your intro, you talked about how you initially started doing SEO, that's where you started, and then you moved to paid growth. Well, how do you think about those two investments as a founder trying to decide which direction to go? What would your advice be of spend your time here versus there if X, Y, Z?

Jonathan Becker (00:29:56):
When I'm asked a question of should we put money into organic search or paid search? My response is often that they're actually not mutually exclusive to one another. So it's a great idea to do both, and that backs into my strategy of diversification of channels. So don't build up exclusively in one area and create volatility within your marketing mix essentially. SEO is a wonderful marketing capability when it's built out correctly. I think the issues that you run into are cause and effect related. So one of the things that people really like about performance marketing theoretically is that we can spend a certain amount and then if we're modeling things correctly, we can essentially determine how much revenue is generated from the actions that we took. Finance teams love that, C-suite teams love that, they can build projections, they can budget around it. There's some degree of predictability around it if it's done properly.

(00:30:52):
Search engine optimization is different in that the attribution can be tough. It's difficult to determine whether ultimately the actions that you took contributed to a rise in organic traffic. You have to essentially correlate that. And the reason is because when you build clusters of content and it's grouped thematically and you're targeting buckets of keywords, whether they're long tail or head keywords, whatever it may be, you can publish all of that on your website. Google still has to crawl it. They run it through their analysis algorithm, which is comprised of 200 different signals, of which maybe 20 to 30 have been publicly disclosed. So it's a bit of a black box.

(00:31:37):
We don't really know ultimately what ROI comes off of that unless you're very sophisticated, like probably one of your other guests, Ethan, in terms of measurement. Whereas paid, the ROI is still a difficult problem to solve, but there was a lot more of a linear relationship as it relates to attribution. And so paid being tangible was the reason why I leaned heavily into paid and ultimately away from SEO. But I do think that if you do SEO properly, the payoffs are indisputable and it is certainly an important part of a modern media mix.

Lenny (00:32:18):
You mentioned this earlier, I've heard this more and more recently that one of the biggest levers these days in paid growth is around creatives. It's not tooling or smarter data, or you tell me if I'm wrong, but it's just getting better creatives. And so I'll let you actually explain, what are creatives? There's a term creatives that people outside the industry don't really necessarily get. And then broadly, what should people be doing to optimize the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:32:46):
Certainly. So when we say creative, we're referring to the assets that power typically visual programmatic or pay per click campaigns on social channels or display networks. And so literally the motion graphics ad that you see on Facebook, the user generated content that you see on TikTok or a static ad that you might see that has a pretty picture in it or whatever. And so I think that when we talk about creative as a big lever around efficiency and optimization, the underlying conversation there is that over time our industry has been heavily automated. So a lot of the levers so to speak around performance have been automated by Google and Facebook over the last seven to 10 years. That's because originally when you ran these campaigns, you needed to have a rocket scientist in front of them. It was so complicated and there were so many different things that you could get wrong, and their solution, the channels like the big tech company solution to this is figuring it out for you. So eventually Google wants you to say, hey, I'm Google, give me your credit card and I'll take care of everything else. Facebook-

Lenny (00:33:57):
And the URL to point people to, and then we'll do the rest.

Jonathan Becker (00:34:00):
Yeah. I don't know if that's a great idea for consumers, by the way. But in the meantime, there's certain things that have just been fully automated. In the context of creative, it's still one of these things that for now is not auto-generated in the world of AI and all the changes that we're seeing. Maybe that's something that will change. But for now, essentially creative directors and their teams are concepting and producing different types of assets. And so there's a bunch of problems that we typically see when people come to us. So number one, performance marketing and brand marketing in a lot of organizations are two different things. And the designers that occupy brand teams bandwidth and whatnot often don't have a sense of how paid acquisition works.

(00:34:48):
And so one of the pitfalls of working with certain companies or the mistake that they make is the design team will hand off a file full of random assets for paid acquisition without any sense of how the channel works. And what I mean by that is these days we're using the analogy, the classic analogy of the funnel to organize our thinking around creative assets. So you can think about this as generating intent at the top of funnel and capturing intent at the bottom of the funnel. When I think about an experience that I want a consumer to have on Facebook, audience targeting and creative, I think about us beginning a conversation at the top of funnel creatively with an audience, having that conversation change as we say different things, and the audience that we're targeting ultimately graduates through different behaviors on our website from one to another, and then ultimately it resulting in an end to the conversation where they take an action hopefully that the brand that we're working with is looking for.

(00:35:56):
And so there's a clear beginning, middle and end to that. And one of the major pitfalls that we see is that certain brands just dump one homogenous message into all of their targeting. You see the same ad over and over again. It creates banner blindness and it's a total lack of efficiency. The antidote to that is to have resources dedicated to paid and essentially iterate upon the creative assets themselves based on the data that we see coming from ad sets and campaigns in various channels. And so what that means is that you have to experiment. You have to take a bit of a scientific approach, although it's a bit of an art and a bit of a science. You have to try and isolate variables, maintain similar conditions across targeting, and then determine which style and feature of an ad performs best at which stage of the funnel versus which audience. And the results that we see are dramatically different from brand to brand. But if you are not undertaking rigorous testing in conjunction with how you are driving the iteration and design of your ads, then you will not make progress essentially.

Lenny (00:37:11):
Is there a specific example that comes to mind here as something we did that just dramatically changed the impact of a change to a creative? Or if you can't think of one, are there just specific tactics that you can suggest for people to improve the way they approach creatives?

Jonathan Becker (00:37:28):
Yeah. So I think from a testing point of view, let's say I was running ads on Meta, beneath the campaign level when I create a campaign, the structure that my testing might take would be that I would have an audience, a single audience at the ad set level, and then I would have two nearly identical creatives within that ad set. The only thing being different across those two creative assets is a single variable. So it might be the copy, it might be an image or whatnot. That allows us to isolate a lot of variables and really test into one singular change across two creative assets. There's a lot of nuance to this. So sometimes the ad-serving algorithms, even when we set up a test structurally in that way, we'll serve one ad a different number of impressions than the other ad, in which case we then have to say, what is a leveling factor that allows us to look at these two ads equally, even though one received dramatically more impressions than the other?

(00:38:31):
This becomes where it becomes subjective in terms of how you want to determine success. But a good example is looking at the click-through rate, which is essentially a ratio or a metric like impressions until conversion, which is a leveling metric that allows us to determine, even though in a scenario where two ads facing the same audience within the same campaign received different numbers of impressions, we can still measure the efficiency or effectiveness of one ad over the other using metrics like that. And so from a testing point of view, I think that this is one way that we might look at trying to assess ad performance so that we can gather learnings, send that back to a creative team and say, hey, it turns out that when this copy is used at this stage of the funnel, it converts 50% more frequently than this other copy.

(00:39:26):
So let's now take that copy, use it as our base copy and challenge it with a different type of copy and see if we can continually iterate and refine. So that's a very practical example of how ad creative testing might work on a channel like Meta. You asked for specific examples where we've seen an unlock. There's two that come to mind. Several years ago we realized that highly produced ads from brand teams, and there's nothing wrong with brand teams, we work with them all the time. They do amazing work. I think we're just trying to work as a singular unit as opposed to being fragmented. But a lot of the brand guidelines of different companies would end up yielding these highly polished assets. And when you launch those on Instagram back in the day or something like that, what we found is that they would always underperform next to user generated assets.

(00:40:23):
So a brand that essentially has an influencer in front of it that says, I tried this product, I love it, I'm filming this ad from my iPhone. Look, check it out. Here's the product, here's me, I'm better off for it. Whatever it is that they're talking about. The unpolished iPhone, mobile phone creative, suddenly we realized massively outperformed these other channels because there was an authenticity to it. And rather than the brands themselves saying, hey, trust us, our product is great, here's a third party essentially validating what is so great about these brands, basically. So I can't speak to specific clients because I'm not allowed to talk about the work that we've done in large part, but that would be one example. And another example is we worked with a furniture company several years ago, which scaled dramatically, but they were having difficulty early on thinking through how to scale social ads.

(00:41:21):
And so paid search worked really well for them. Social ads, again, they had these highly produced styled rooms and one of the owners had their dog in the office all the time, and so they have these models sitting on furniture or whatever it was, and they would take these beautiful styled shots of their furniture in a room and one of the art directors was like, put the dog on the couch and let's take some photos of dogs on furniture, which made it more playful and approachable. That one change resulted in a total unlock of their performance on paid social channels. It would double or triple the ROAS that we were seeing type thing. So it's these minute differences that you can test into that ultimately can drive performance.

Lenny (00:42:04):
That reminds me of Airbnb. The photography team found, and actually the photography team was initially including people in the photos of listings, and that was the [inaudible 00:42:16] images of listing photos. And it turns out when there's no people in the listing photo, much higher conversion. And the theory basically people don't want to see other random strangers in a place they're going to sleep, and that was not expected.

Jonathan Becker (00:42:29):
That's a really great example. And so the question becomes, as a company and as a brand, do you arrive at those learnings anecdotally by accident? Is it the brilliance of one person on the team that the whole brand is predicated upon in terms of performance? Or do you put a very rigorous structure around testing and the iteration of assets and how to determine whether something works over another thing that is a process that yields the outcomes that you're looking for? And so a lot of times with agencies, people talk to us about the obvious hard skills that we have, but the soft skills are around process that can be deployed, that can actually be the difference between being highly sophisticated or unsophisticated. Internal teams do this too, but that Airbnb example is a great illustration of how if you put the right testing in place, you can yield an outcome that becomes an unlock for performance.

Lenny (00:43:28):
Getting even more tactical with that idea of testing a bunch of creatives makes me think about a story from chatting with a guy from Wish who's had a growth at Wish about how they uploaded hundreds of variations. And I think Wish is the epitome of the opposite of brand highly polished ads or it's just the most ridiculous looking product with just banners and numbers and prices and crossouts and all kinds of stuff, just anything that would take to get people to click. Is there a tool or process that you can point people to to help them do this testing on creatives or is it mostly built into the existing tools now and there's nothing really fancy about it?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:04):
We get asked this a lot and I think there are tools for different types of functions that we undertake in the process of running paid acquisition for different brands, but these days most of the testing that we do is within the channels themselves. So Meta ads, Google Ads, I keep touching on those two specifically because they're the most advanced in my opinion. They're really powerful. The good news here is that you don't necessarily need some exotic tool to do sophisticated creative testing. You can do it in platform and you can use the structure that I just kind of outlined as a starting point.

Lenny (00:44:43):
You mentioned Google and Facebook. What is your take on TikTok and YouTube and maybe Snap? Do you recommend people go there and there's a big opportunity? Do you think it's overblown? Do you think people should just take Google and Facebook basically at this point? What's your general advice?

Jonathan Becker (00:44:59):
So when I say Google and I say Facebook, I'm talking about the Google ecosystem of channels inclusive of YouTube. And when I talk about Facebook, I'm talking about Facebook, Instagram, and probably eventually WhatsApp, which I think will probably launch ads later this year. With all that said, some interesting opportunities these days really exist on channels like Amazon and TikTok as well as a number of other challenger channels I think. Snap I'll talk a little bit less about because I think really there's just fewer and fewer people potentially using Snap. There's no knock on Snap. I use Snap, I like it a lot, but at the same time, most individuals or organizations tend to want to place ads where there's a lot of views and engagement and the king of this right now is definitely TikTok. And so TikTok faces its own set of challenges and arguably there is as much an opportunity there as a barrier at the moment.

(00:45:58):
I love TikTok. I'm a consumer of content on TikTok, not a producer of content on TikTok. Their ads platform kind of reminds me of where Facebook ads was like six, seven years ago. It's not super sophisticated and attribution is not great yet, but you can get cheap CPCs because there's just fewer organizations advertising there. Fewer companies have figured out how to make that work. And same thing with Amazon. Amazon is a bit of a bespoke channel. It doesn't work for a B2B SaaS company. It's more specific to D2C I would say. But essentially those channels are wonderful. They're not at the point yet where they're kind of ubiquitous. Every single advertiser that has ever worked with us I think in the last 10 years is for sure on Google. Everybody does that. And then the question is, what else can I invest money in with the expectation of profitability?

(00:46:53):
And so TikTok and Amazon, and even if I want to break out YouTube, they tend to be a little bit more specific and they definitely work, but not for everybody yet. And so the question becomes, will TikTok become as prominent as a social ads platform like Meta Ads? And we just don't know yet. What we see working very nicely on TikTok, by the way, are these founder led brands where the founder is the ambassador and they're doing those handheld videos with their iPhone. They're talking about the merits of the products that they make. They're talking about the problems that they solve. They are great at cultivating a following. Their content is highly engaging. Those types of organizations crush it. Also, companies that got really good at partnering with influencers. So we haven't talked about partner marketing that much, but affiliate marketing companies got into this early, and then influencer marketing networks are all over this. But essentially having these third parties be an ambassador for your brand in an authentic way, partnering with them, having them generate the content. And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems...

Jonathan Becker (00:48:00):
... And that's the nature of the partnership. Stuff like that seems to work quite well.

Lenny (00:48:05):
Awesome, I love those bullet points of just what is likely to work on TikTok.

Jonathan Becker (00:48:05):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:48:09):
Just broadly, would you say TikTok advertising today is underrated, overrated, or just right?

Jonathan Becker (00:48:16):
If you are e-comm based, if you're wholesale, retail based, anything direct to consumer, you have to investigate TikTok and try and figure out whether there's a way of promoting your products there, basically. It's a massive, highly engaged audience with somewhat specific demographics. It's a very exciting opportunity. Other brands need to pay attention to this and figure out what their entry point is going to be. And just because the innovation hasn't happened for B2B SaaS yet on TikTok doesn't mean it won't. TikTok wants that to happen, and so the question becomes how. And so someone will unlock that, and they'll make a billion dollars because of it.

(00:48:59):
But I wouldn't recommend that channel to everybody yet, and at Thrive for instance, we don't have a huge amount of people coming to us yet saying, "Hey, I'm spending $750,000 a month on TikTok, can you help me?" Type thing. The other problem with TikTok is that it's extraordinarily creative, asset dependent, and heavy. And so you are launching net new assets several times per week, it is hard for creative teams and brands to produce that much content. It takes a machine, and that's expensive, and so that all factors into the cost of not only just the ad dollars, but the creative resourcing and investment that's required to power that. So it can be done in a more nimble manner if you're spending less, but you can't really get to a million dollars a month on TikTok without having a huge amount of creative being pushed to that channel.

Lenny (00:49:56):
Awesome, that's really good advice. I want to chat out about AI soon, just because I imagine that could help with some of these things. But you mentioned B2B SaaS, and I wanted to ask, I imagine Google is the primary channel for B2B SaaS, and if not, or if it is, where else do you find there's value in spending money to drive growth through B2B SaaS, which channels and ad networks?

Jonathan Becker (00:50:20):
So I'm agnostic here in terms of where people should be spending money. I see this world in terms of impressions and clicks, and does that conform to the marketing economics of a project that needs to be achieved in order for it to grow. It's less about where to place your money and how to think about the placement of those funds. And so the common mistake that we see as people build out a funnel, so to speak, for B2B lead gen projects, or B2C lead gen projects, is they'll be overly reliant on the first of a sequence of metrics that ultimately yields a sale.

(00:50:57):
So typically it's something like cost per lead, marketing qualified lead, sales accepted lead, there might be a couple more metrics there, and then eventually a sale occurs. And so that the thinking is that, okay, for sales to occur, I need more leads at the top of the funnel. The more leads I have, the more marketing qualified leads I'll get, the more sales accepted leads get, and ultimately the more opportunities there will be and the more revenue will generate.

(00:51:24):
And so if I think about this world of lead generation on performance marketing platforms as a function of cost per lead in that sense that I just described, then the tendency is always to want to drive down the cost per lead, thinking that that's the efficiency, I can get more cheaper leads and that will yield more revenue. When in fact it turns out that if you flip that conversation on its head and say, not all opportunities and sales are equal, and instead of focusing upfront on a cost per lead, I now want to focus on what is a high value customer, so the cost per lead is actually higher, but the ROI of targeting those people is also higher. And so to get the higher quality leads, it's not a function of CPL.

(00:52:15):
And so that is a very common pitfall that we see when people come to us. The antidote to this, it's interesting, so Thrive developed an ETL tool, an extract transfer load tool called Thrive Stack. It's not commercially available, but if you wanted a commercially available version of this, you can use something called Supermetrics. Basically Supermetrics is a data connector. There's a world of different data connectors out there, but it allows you to pipe, via an API, revenue data from your CRM into a third party database that can then be joined with data from the channel itself. You can build tables within a database and normalize them together in a manner where you can start to determine the relationship between, again, the audience that a particular cohort of opportunities came from and whether a sufficient degree of revenue is derived from those opportunities.

(00:53:08):
And then you can build upon that what is known as a lead scoring model, which allows you to bid in real time on the audiences that have a higher likelihood to convert to high revenue generating customers. And so the magic there, we talked a little bit about rates of return and instant gratification in the performance marketing world, lead generation inherently is a slow gratification process. And so the problem is that if my pipeline is full of opportunities that yield revenue in two months, six months, sometimes 12 months, how do I determine how heavily to bid on different leads today in order to predictively have an outcome where I'm maximizing revenue? And a lead scoring model basically solves for that.

Lenny (00:53:59):
Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming.

(00:54:20):
And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. For example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming using sticky notes, reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro. com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:55:06):
You talked about attribution, and I thought this would be a great time to get into that. So the way I think about this is oftentimes the biggest challenge in driving growth isn't the actual work you do to drive growth, it's measuring what impact your work is having and understanding where dollars are spent effectively. And things are changing heavily in attribution land with privacy shifts and ATT and iOS 14.5.1, or maybe whatever the version was that came out that changed everything. And so my question is, what changed, is one, in terms of being able to do attribution. Maybe even explain what attribution means for folks that are just like, what the hell are you even talking about? And then finally, just what do you recommend people do now to do attribution well in this new environment?

Jonathan Becker (00:55:57):
Yeah, it's a really, really great and pertinent question in the industry, and it has a lot of focus on it now, but attribution has always been a conversation that's been very important. So just to kick things off, attribution essentially is how we determine the relationship between what we did and what happened. In the context of performance marketing this means what ads did we serve, what campaigns did we launch, and generally what was the revenue ultimately that was derived from these campaigns? And so there's a funny quote that I love, someone named John Wanamaker in 1919 said, "I know-"

Lenny (00:56:33):
I bet I'm going to guess what it is.

Jonathan Becker (00:56:34):
Do you want to guess?

Lenny (00:56:35):
It's, "Half my marketing dollars are wasted, I just don't know which half."

Jonathan Becker (00:56:41):
Exactly, I love that you knew that. He said this in 1919. The world was a very different place there, but oddly enough we still have these types of problems today and it's because the world of what I did and what happened because of what I did is very complicated. There's so many variables, some of which we know, and then some of which we don't know that we don't know, type thing. And so attribution, as it stands in our industry, is still an incredibly subjective art and somewhat of a science. It doesn't mean that it's impossible, and it doesn't mean that there aren't varying degrees of sophistication as it relates to attribution, but we're still in a place where we have to understand the business and its goals, and then start to work on an attribution model.

(00:57:32):
An attribution model is probably something that is never solved, but I'll give you a couple of examples. So number one around attribution, it's important to determine whether an organization, a company, a client, is focused on profitability or growth. Whether I use one attribution lens or another will drive those outcomes. And so these days, for a number of different reasons, you mentioned iOS 14.5, in addition to third party cookie deprecation, and whatnot.

(00:58:02):
There's no one way necessarily of approaching attribution. The most classic and commonly held version of attribution used to be a cookie-based form of attribution called last click attribution, meaning that the last click in the sequence of clicks that yielded a conversion would be attributed with all the revenue from that conversion. Other models in a cookie-based world involved first touch attribution, so it's actually the first click. So I launch an ad, it's in an audience that doesn't know about my service or my brand, and so the first click that I get should be given all the credit for that sale. And then there's multi-touch attribution, which can take several different forms, but essentially is saying it's not one way or the other of the two first versus last click options, it's somewhere in between. So I'm going to create a weighted attribution model where the first touch gets so much of the credit and the last touch gets so much of the credit.

(00:58:59):
This is very subjective, as you can see. I am essentially looking at my business model, determining what my goals are, and then I'm backing out into an attribution methodology that I think adheres to both the economics of my business and the capabilities of these platforms. And again, we live in a world where a single brand might do television advertising, they might buy media in magazines, they might buy billboards, they might get impressions from Facebook, they might do paid search, so there's a big argument over how to ultimately model this.

(00:59:34):
So there was something called an IDFA that Apple allowed advertisers to use, and essentially what that was, it literally means ID for advertisers, and it allowed Facebook, Google, and other advertisers, Snap, TikTok, whoever was essentially selling ads that were predicated on being displayed on a Apple mobile device or a desktop device, it allowed the advertiser to provide attribution metrics and certain types of customer match metric metrics in their own platforms. And so when Apple ultimately launches its privacy changes, I believe in mid-2021, overnight it allows users to say, "Well, I don't want to share that information, I'm not going to share my IDFA anymore." Or, "Yes, I do want to share my IDFA." And so what you see as a result of that is less of the core data that Facebook in particular would've required to make attribution more airtight and ultimately validate its advertising.

(01:00:43):
So because we can no longer validate attribution on Facebook as seamlessly, we are in a situation where we're not sure any longer which audiences to target, and we're not sure how to run all of our creative testing, and ultimately we can't even determine the degree of revenue that's coming from particular campaigns that we've launched, and whatnot. And so it created quite a stir in the world of attribution, which is obviously this core discussion to is it working or not? People want to answer John Wanamaker's question, but the modern methodology now is through a number of different approaches to validation.

(01:01:25):
So the cookie based attribution, which had been probably the most popular version of attribution in the 2010s, really up to this point, is now one of the ways that we would look at this, but we would also include things like various forms of statistical modeling, customer surveys, population surveys, there's a number of different ways to the same place here. Statistical modeling, by the way, one thing that's very popular these days, which I think was originally created in the 1950s, is a form of statistical modeling called media mix modeling. It's essentially regression analysis, and it is trying to determine the causal relationship between, again, what you did and what the effect was on revenue. That's very topical in the industry these days. If you're looking for a tool off the shelf that can help with this, Recast is something that I see people using. But a lot of organizations build these highly customized bespoke models that ultimately feed the algorithm inside of an MMM model in a customized manner.

Lenny (01:02:27):
What is it, or is there a recommendation of just like, hey, if you're trying to do attribution today, here's what you should do. Is there a clear, do this, piece of advice, or is it super personalized depending on what you're trying to do?

Jonathan Becker (01:02:42):
The advice is that there's no single source of truth. Anyone who claims that they are a single source of truth, whether it's an individual, a model that they've created, or a tool that they've created, is not being accurate. I believe that the approach that works to attribution is that it's an ongoing investigation and it never stops, and essentially what you're doing is looking for evidence that validates the outcome of your performance marketing campaigns one way or the other.

(01:03:12):
There have been plenty of incredibly sophisticated attribution models that we've helped build and invalidated with MMM or other types of tools that have indicated that the campaigns do not work. So I will repeat that, we, a very sophisticated organization, have stood up campaigns that we measure and ultimately determine do not work, and that is an important finding in terms of an organization's determination of whether they want to continually invest, take budget out of these channels, or invest into other areas.

Lenny (01:03:49):
Awesome. You mentioned a company called Recast. I don't think you knew this, but I'm actually an investor, and so obviously a big fan, so check it out. I don't know what the site is, recast.com maybe. I think if you Google Recast attribution, we'll also have a link in the show notes.

Jonathan Becker (01:04:02):
Cool. Yeah, they're working with a couple of our clients right now and it's interesting, I like their approach.

Lenny (01:04:06):
Yeah, they're basically, they're building the model as a SaaS tool to do attribution in a really clever way. Amazing. Okay, just a couple more questions, one is around AI, one is around agencies, and just how to start down this road. How has AI in any way impacted the work you're doing today, or the work of paid growth, performance marketing, and then where do you think this will go in the next few years?

Jonathan Becker (01:04:29):
Interestingly, and I think I alluded to this earlier, but our industry has been influenced by AI for over a decade. So Google, Facebook, even Microsoft, these are some of the organizations that historically have been at the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence, and their goal was always to automate as much as possible within these platforms. And so the effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. So we're actually, we have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic, it's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers, like some of the things that we've talked about, and less so the trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.

(01:05:19):
So I think if we are the canary in the coal mine for other industries, what will be interesting is I assume that if you work in an architecture office that you'll be doing less of the drafting, and it's already been a change that's occurred in those offices, but you'll be doing less of the drafting and more of this strategic problem solving around what kind of building is necessary for the client in this scenario, type thing.

(01:05:42):
And so on a practical level, though, some of these conversational AI models are very interesting for us in that when I think about creative testing, for instance, we can have ChatGPT come up with all kinds of variants of copy that we would not have necessarily thought of. It can do a lot of drafting of things like RFP responses, so we can feed ChatGPT 100 previous RFP responses that we've done and have it spit out net new responses to net new questions in a net new RFP, and it's like 80% good and still requires 10 hours of work to massage to the point where we can send it off to a client, but that replaces a week of work with five or six people that it would've previously taken.

Lenny (01:06:33):
And that's already happening today, you're saying?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:35):
That's happening now, literally right now, type thing, all of what I just said. And there's a lot of different ways that we are beginning to use AI to do more with less, basically. So that's how I see it influencing not just our industry, but other people's businesses as well.

Lenny (01:06:55):
That's amazing. So just to repeat what you said, your team now, because of ChatGPT is able to spend more time higher level, and leverage specifically ChatGPT to do this kind of, and RFPs are basically proposals, people are asking you to pitch to work with them, is that?

Jonathan Becker (01:06:55):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:07:12):
Okay, yeah.

Jonathan Becker (01:07:13):
Some of these AI-driven organizations that allow you to type in a prompt and it spits out an image, on our creative group we can come up with mockups in literally 1% of the time that it took. So you no longer have to draw the initial mockups for art. Suddenly what might have taken one person a week of work on a campaign takes an afternoon, type thing. You still have to understand what questions to ask of the AI and be capable of iterating, but these rough drafts that you might show the artwork of to a client to say, "Do we like this more or do we like this more?" That's AI generated. It's really interesting.

Lenny (01:07:55):
What's the tool your team uses for that, is it MidJourney or Dall-E or something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:08:00):
It's Dall-E and it's MidJourney, so you got it.

Lenny (01:08:03):
Got it. And so what you use it for is you're thinking about a concept and you just come up with a mock, coming up with a prompt to pitch what this could be.

Jonathan Becker (01:08:11):
Yeah, the interesting thing there is that these concepts often live inside of someone's head, and we do this thing as humans where we verbally discuss it, and I try and put the image in my mind's eye, in your mind's eye, which is an inherently inefficient process and actually hurts our ability to be creative leaders. Someone might just see it slightly differently than you do. Now that person theoretically can use Dall-E to output what is inside their head, and they can refine that easily through subsequent prompts in Dall-E or MidJourney, or whatever it may be, and then just say, "Do you like this? This is my idea." And so in a way it's helped humans connect more easily in that context than we were capable of doing before, and then in the context of pitching a client on ideas, we are capable of generating more ideas faster and iterating upon them live. So I can have a Zoom call with you, I can present my screen, and if you don't like the output of Dall-E that I just prompted, I can re-prompt based on your feedback in real time.

Lenny (01:09:16):
There's this sentiment that AIs going to take away the fun stuff of jobs, like maybe being creative and coming up with a new concept and photography, setting up a whole photo shoot, whatever.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:30):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:09:30):
Do you find that your team is excited about uploading this to Dall-E, or are they just like, goddammit, this is what I loved, and now I'm just sitting around in docs writing prompts.

Jonathan Becker (01:09:40):
I am not an incredible artist, but now I can take those thoughts in my mind and output them just as well as someone who's pretty skilled in artwork. So in a sense, I'm excited because this technology democratizes the ability to do this across everyone. Anyone who can think a thought can generate an image on an AI image generator. How many scribes do you know?

Lenny (01:10:04):
Zero, I believe zero.

Jonathan Becker (01:10:06):
Because we invented something called the printing press, and the printing press took over what was a cottage industry for very specific individuals that allowed them to control the flow of information. Yet today it's not like we have fewer writers or creative thinkers, they're just using different tools to arrive at the same place. You could say the same thing of the loom. There used to be people who would stitch your T-shirt together, or your sweater together, and none of those people have work anymore. There's still people who knit, I suppose. But your clothes are made in factories with machines, and the quality of the clothing is arguably a lot better than it was, maybe I'm wrong about that point, but you can make more of it and more sophisticated clothing.

(01:10:46):
There's no question that AI is going to displace and replace certain industries of people, certain roles. I'm not going to pretend like I know whether that's a good or bad thing, and I'm also not a poster child for AI, I am really just using the technology that's available to us to run our business the best way we can. We haven't let anybody go yet because of these efficiencies. The people who used to do the artwork are the ones using these tools, and I think they're excited that they're more productive. Is there going to be nuance around that? Of course. Are some people going to be sad about the changes? Yes. I think human nature is that people generally don't like change, but I think over time we've seen change has been a productive and positive thing for society, not a negative thing.

Lenny (01:11:35):
Awesome. Yeah, so it sounds like the team is excited, generally, and that's a good sign, and that's what I find generally. I think some people will be really upset, but most people will be like, amazing, and they never wanted to do this part.

Jonathan Becker (01:11:47):
This generation of people will be upset, and then there will be a subsequent generation that never knew anything different. So the way that I think about this is the people growing up these days have always had the internet, whereas you and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI-

Jonathan Becker (01:12:00):
You and I probably remember a time before the internet existed. AI is a platform like the internet and just as when the internet was launched, you couldn't conceive of amazon.com or all of these wonderful or social networks or whatever it was. The permutations of what AI will become, even in the current GPT 4 context or Dolly context or whatever it may be. We don't know what people are going to create with this and so it's difficult for the generation that knew what life was like beforehand, before iPhone, before internet, before AI, but there will be people who know nothing but this eventually, and to them it'll just be normal.

Lenny (01:12:42):
Until we're all just replaced by AI and then it's AI writing ads to get other AI tools to buy products from each other.

Jonathan Becker (01:12:42):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:12:49):
And then we're just sitting around watching Netflix and that'll be great. There's always this question when you're starting to invest in paid growth, performance marketing of should we work at an agency? Should we work? Should we hire someone junior to figure it out? Should we hire someone senior?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:03):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:13:03):
What's your general advice for, say, an early stage startup when it makes sense to work with an agency versus bringing someone in-house?

Jonathan Becker (01:13:12):
Mm-hmm. We need people in-house to do our jobs properly. Agencies are not mutually exclusive to personnel in-house. If we don't have a point of contact, for instance, at an earlier stage company and we're supposed to report to the CEO, CEOs tend to be very busy people and we often just can't get the information and approvals that we need to be successful. If you think that growth marketing is an opportunity and that performance marketing is a subset of growth marketing that you want some focus on, the reality is you're going to need expertise and you probably should start in-house and then hire an agency.

(01:13:49):
Again, there's different stages of companies and different examples of what makes sense at different stages and the nature of the work that we do at different stages changes. Very, very late stage, we're kind of doing a lot of this sophisticated production work. We're implementing sophisticated testing, we're working on attribution, we're building beautiful reporting, but in a sense, we're maintaining this machine that already exists. Earlier stage, we're doing a lot more of net new experimentation, trying to discover what is working and what sequence of audience targeting versus creative asset display will work, what channel mix works, and all of that. A lot of times the body of work that's required to nail that and the inputs to literally out front what questions to be asking isn't something that a small in-house team possesses and so they will work with an agency to scale faster, to get where they're going quicker, to bring in more resources quickly, basically. Then later stage, sometimes it's a permutation of the same thing or we're really just managing a whole bunch of different capabilities that they have because it's very complicated and difficult to staff.

Lenny (01:15:05):
That is really interesting. So it's not like agency versus in-house full-time person. It's you need both is what you're finding.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:11):
I don't think we have any projects that we're working on where there's not a professional marketing person as our POC and generally the people that we report to have a background in what we do, whether they ended up doing something different and now they're a VP or a director level and not directly managing channels themselves is one thing or another. But yeah, we work with people that have in-house expertise all day long.

Lenny (01:15:35):
I see. Sometimes it could just be a generalist marketing person that becomes your point of contact.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:35):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:15:39):
They don't have to be experienced in paper.

Jonathan Becker (01:15:41):
There's one more thing. As agencies, we're constantly solving people's problems in the market and as a result of that, I have a fairly large team of 130 people that think about performance marketing all day long. It's the first thing we think about when we have our morning coffee and it's the last thing we think about as we're leaving the office kind of thing. We have very sophisticated and built out capabilities as well as all kinds of software and processes and capabilities, I guess, that we've created that most in-house teams just don't have because they're smaller or newer or someone might be really sophisticated but they don't have the resources to implement it and stuff. In the same way that a really sophisticated organization might go to Boston Consulting Group or McKenzie to say, "Hey, we did this, but you do more of this all day long and we need advice on how to be more efficient," people come to Thrive saying, "Hey, we're top of our game. We have really strong people. They absolutely know what they're doing," which is always the case by the way, "But we're looking for extra sophistication and additional capabilities that are very difficult to create in an in-house organization." It's why we worked with Uber for 10 years. It was tough to replace us.

Lenny (01:16:59):
Yeah, that's quite the retention. 10 years, 10 years going, I imagine our net dollar retention has gone up too.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:08):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:17:09):
When you're looking to hire someone full-time to drive the paid growth channel and/or work with an agency, what do you recommend people look for specifically, especially things maybe they're not likely to think about when they're hiring someone that people often miss?

Jonathan Becker (01:17:26):
There's a couple of competencies that I think are very important. I found that, so I was a nerd as a child, if you can't tell, I don't know.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Nope.

Jonathan Becker (01:17:35):
Super nerdy, geeky kid. I would take apart-

Lenny (01:17:38):
[inaudible 01:17:38].

Jonathan Becker (01:17:39):
I would take apart my parents' computers, I'd try and rebuild them. I was fooling around with bulletin boards before websites existed, stuff like that. Then I became a web developer and as I transitioned into a performance marketing role, I realized that being technical and having technical aptitudes was extraordinarily helpful in terms of being on the front line of what we were doing and solving problems. If you're making your first hire, you probably want them to have the ingenuity and capability to solve a lot of the problems that you're going to run into within the context of tracking, attribution, data visualization, and then campaign management. Number one, do they have a technical background? That can be multidisciplinary.

(01:18:22):
At Thrive, we have someone who is a nuclear physicist that left discipline and became a performance marketer. We have people who have left mathematics and become performance marketers, people who left finance, full stack engineering, all kinds of stuff. Those are technical fields where people tend to be good at math and good at problem solving, and so that's a strong piece of evidence that they might have a strong aptitude for performance marketing and managing this.

(01:18:52):
Another thing is just literally do they have experience in this discipline? Have they managed on any level Meta ads, Google ads, TikTok, Amazon, some of the things we talked about? Do they have an appreciation for some of the inputs that we just discussed today that ultimately create the conditions for success within a performance marketing environment? Do they understand the role of creative? Do they understand the role of proper attribution and are they capable of understanding the mechanics of your business and so on and so forth?

(01:19:29):
I would say just fundamentally, those are some of the areas that when we are interviewing we're looking for. As an agency too, we are looking for the ability to work with people and be excellent at client services. One of the questions we might ask, I actually borrowed a Jeff Bezos question from early stage Amazon where I asked people without much warning in an interview, I'll ask them whether it's okay to do a bit of a thought experiment together and whether they are comfortable responding to a logic question. I'll ask the question of, "How many windows are there in New York City?" There's two things that I look for in this scenario. One is can they think on their feet? I'm not actually looking for the correct answer. It's a pretty difficult question to solve. But number one, do you realize that windows are not just building windows and windows are also in cars and trucks and stuff like that, so there's more than one type of window. Then can you just do the arithmetic of saying there's so many buildings per hectare or square mile or whatever it is and it's division multiplication type stuff.

(01:20:33):
But also from a client services point of view, I'm trying to see whether in a scenario where I've asked them something that they obviously probably weren't prepared for, that is a strange thing to ask and probably makes them feel a little bit uncomfortable, how they react in that situation. Do they remain composed or do they lose their composure and get frustrated or even angry that I asked them something that's pretty weird to ask? Their reaction there is often a good leading indicator of whether or not in a client scenario working with our clients, they can compose themselves in a difficult situation.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Very tactically, what level of experience do you recommend people look for in their first performance marketing hire year or two, four or five years, longer?

Jonathan Becker (01:21:23):
I've seen people who have 10 years of experience in the industry not be that great and then I've seen people who have one year of experience be absolutely phenomenal. I would say that again, the years of service under their belt is one clue or piece of evidence to their potential aptitude. But really, you want someone who can clearly demonstrate to you that they can competently run the channels I suppose. If what you're asking is literally at the level where someone is managing pay per click and programmatic media buying, then you want to make sure that they can just do that and I would say it's less about the years of experience. A lot of times people only want to do those types of jobs for a couple years before they're like, "Hey, what's your plan for me? I'm tired of running ads and building campaigns. I want to manage the people who do that now." The people who tend to really do that are often somewhat earlier on in their careers. That's just a reality that we see.

Lenny (01:22:25):
One more very technical question. What do you recommend the title for this role be? Growth marketer, something else?

Jonathan Becker (01:22:31):
I've seen so many different names for this. I think again, if the intention is to grow out a growth marketing capability, which again is not exclusive to performance marketing, then you're looking for a manager role of growth marketing manager. I've seen paid acquisition specialist for people who just manage channels. I've seen paid acquisition manager, performance marketing manager, media planner and buyer. I've seen all kinds of different roles. But when we are launching a new role these days, there's such wonderful tools like everything from Glassdoor to LinkedIn to PayScale where you can essentially just look at what other people are calling it and borrow from their role descriptions and then create your own role description and then determine what role is meaningful in the context of your own organization.

Lenny (01:23:23):
Awesome. Last question. We started with the story of how you landed Uber, and I know you also have an interesting story which I haven't heard of how you landed Snap/Snapchat as a client, so maybe tell that story.

Jonathan Becker (01:23:38):
It's a fun story and I think it's about ultimately confidence and knowing your craft. I believe it was like 2015 or 2016, we were essentially contacted to participate in an RFP down in Los Angeles. RFPs are difficult processes and essentially a department of a company is saying, "We want performance marketing and here are all the questions that we're going to ask you and exercises you need to complete in order to vet you as to whether you are the right partner or not." Sometimes RFPs are incredibly thoughtful and they're run by people who have either done a lot of RFPs in the context of what we do or they know specifically what the outcome is. Then in other cases, they're very experienced marketing departments with senior people and an approach that they may take is every stakeholder within that department gets to submit one or two questions to a long list of questions and the respondents have to respond to all of this.

(01:24:38):
The RFP process for Snap was somewhat complex and they asked a range of different questions and we find ourselves in LA at a hotel the night before, it's 2:00 in the morning, my business partner and another team member that we had brought down are sweating and we're like, "How are we going to build a presentation out of this? They're asking so many well-meaning but difficult questions that are zigging and zagging." In a pitch situation you want to tell a story, it's important, and that story has to have a beginning, middle, and end. It was just difficult and yet here we were and we had worked with all these really cool organizations and I was very confident that we knew precisely what we were doing. I kind of had this eureka moment where I was like, "Here's what we're going to do." It was Brent MacArthur, my business partner and I kind of arrived at this together, but we're kind of like, "Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have a completely unique take on how to respond to this and we're going to build a deck that's bespoke around X, Y, and Z."

(01:25:54):
We work till 6:00 in the morning, I think we get a couple hours of sleep and then by 10:00, we're sitting in their offices. Essentially the pitch is something like this. I stand there in front of about 20 different executives from their organization and I say, "You have thoughtfully curated an RFP for us to respond to today, and you have asked us to respond to about 20 to 30 different questions. With the utmost respect, I am not going to answer any of your questions today. I'm standing here because you are looking for a marketing partner and you need expertise in this area and instead of telling you the answers to the questions that you asked, I'm going to tell you what I think you need to do to get where you want to go and if you agree with me and my logic and what I talk to you about here today, then you should hire us. If you do not agree with my logic and you think that we're out to lunch, then you should not hire us."

(01:26:47):
You could hear a pin drop in the room. My own team I think was a little bit surprised. We had a whole bunch of technical difficulties that day. Someone who was supposed to Zoom in couldn't make it and so I have to ad lib part of the pitch that I wasn't prepared for, lots of zig and zags. They thank us for RFP response, lots of handshakes and smiling faces, but we don't know whether we're going to land the client or not.

(01:27:12):
Then about two hours later, I was driving to San Francisco with a friend, immediately leave LA for SF because I had a bunch of follow on meetings, and I get a phone call and they were like, "We loved your approach. Congratulations. You're hired."

(01:27:28):
These days I think Snap is still a really interesting organization, but at the time they were kind of bringing the future of a social platform or what a social platform could be in the same way that we think about TikTok right now. TikTok wasn't on the scene yet and Facebook was very worried about Snap and there was tons of engagement on Snap, so this was the it client of the day and it felt amazing.

(01:27:55):
Essentially the lesson was that you have to trust yourself and understand your strengths and weaknesses. In situations where someone is well-meaning but may not understand what they need, be brave and tell them what they need rather than just conforming to what they're asking for because sometimes inadvertently that leads you down the wrong path. We took a big risk and it had a wonderful payoff and we have, in addition to this story, we had a wonderful relationship with them for a couple years.

Lenny (01:28:28):
I love that story. I love how dramatic all your new customers, your way of acquiring customers and I imagine not all of them are this dramatic.

Jonathan Becker (01:28:38):
Not all of them are this dramatic, but there have been some pretty dramatic ones. I think part of running a business and running an agency has been the curation and experience around all these fun, crazy stories that have accumulated as we run this really interesting services business.

Lenny (01:28:55):
Awesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for the lightning round?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:03):
I'm ready. Let's do it.

Lenny (01:29:05):
Okay, great Looking, very excited. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Becker (01:29:13):
As a marketer, Storyworthy by Matthew Dicks is a wonderful book. He is a world world-class storyteller. I don't know if you know him. He wrote this book about how to structure and think about the art of storytelling and every marketer should read Storyworthy. It was a huge contributor to how I think about what we do at Thrive. As an entrepreneur, I love startup stories, so Shoe Dog, which is the startup story of Nike. It's basically Phil Knight talking about all the ups and downs, and it's crazy. Nike shouldn't be a company based on all the turmoil and challenges that they overcame. Fascinating read about taking risk and doing what you think is right and ultimately succeeding and building Nike. Then a book by Nick Bilton called American Kingpin, which is the story of the startup of the Silk Road, which was like this dark web marketplace for some pretty bad stuff. But it is half tech story, startup story and half gangster kind of kingpin story. It honestly should be a Hollywood movie. It reads like a Hollywood thriller. So awesome, great book.

Lenny (01:30:30):
Favorite recent movie or a TV show.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:32):
I don't know how recent it is, but I love The Big Short, just love it.

Lenny (01:30:35):
Not recent at all, but it's still great.

Jonathan Becker (01:30:37):
It's still great. The reason why I like it is because someone found truth in the data they were analyzing and then capitalized on it, which is really an analog for what we do in performance marketing. Then recently I have fallen in love with White Lotus for no particular reason. It's just raw entertainment.

Lenny (01:30:54):
What's something you've changed in the way that you all operate that's been relatively minor in terms of how hard it was to change, but that had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute as a team or a company?

Jonathan Becker (01:31:08):
The tools that we use in performance marketing change constantly. The channels themselves change and therefore what problems exist and what SaaS companies or different types of platforms offer as solutions to problems change. I don't think it's one thing necessarily, this might be a bit of a roundabout answer here, but I mentioned that change itself earlier is something that humans seem to not love, whereas in our industry, and I don't think we're alone here, but there's a culture of change. A welcoming of change, aptitude around change, having a playful mindset with new technology and tools rather than being upset about the fact that AI exists or third party cookies are being deprecated or iOS 14 removed IDFA and trying to be creative around those types of solutions has been like a constant for us. I'm kind of sidestepping the question a little bit, but it is the cultural willingness to adapt that I think has been a strong suit for us as a company.

Lenny (01:32:12):
Speaking of tools, final question. What is your favorite most underrated tool for performance marketing work?

Jonathan Becker (01:32:18):
It's Thrive Stack. It's a tool that we built in-house that allows us to pipe third party data and anonymized customer level data into a database and then ultimately visualize it in a format like Data Studio, Google Data Studio, which I think now is called Looker Studio. That has been a profoundly powerful platform from which we're capable of delivering insights that are built upon the data as opposed to just regurgitated data, if that makes sense. We have not released this technology yet. It's basically a tool we use in-house with our clients. But to a certain extent, I mentioned Supermetrics, which is another ETL and has some of the same capabilities but isn't quite as powerful.

Lenny (01:33:05):
Amazing. Jonathan, this is by far the deepest I've ever gone into the world of paid growth. I really appreciate you making time and sharing all of your wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask some questions maybe, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonathan Becker (01:33:23):

# How a great founder becomes a great CEO | Jonathan Lowenhar (co-founder of Enjoy The Work)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
You basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work. I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:11):
To be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):
I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:30):
Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot. It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Something you talk about, there's these two phases to a startup journey and most people focus on the first phase.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:00:51):
Phase one is build something people want to buy. Phase two, the one we don't talk about is now you have to build a company around that thing people want to buy. Building a company is always the same. I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):
You've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box paradigm that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long-term.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:01:11):
This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you, you ping them and you hope you get a deal. Magic Box argues that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. They see the fantasy, they fall in love.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):
Today, my guest is Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan runs a firm called Enjoy The Work, which I've heard amazing things about from so many people over the years. Their firm has a singular mission, to help founders become great CEOs. They do this through a blend of mentoring and advising services, which are rooted in their study of how the best startups operate. They take these lessons and fold them into frameworks and advice and training that they offer their CEOs, their insight, which you'll hear in our conversation, is that most founders don't come into the job knowing how to be a CEO, which includes learning how to do hiring, how to manage financials, figure out growth strategy, road mapping, planning, people management, and so many other skills that nobody teaches a founder.

(00:02:16):
In our conversation, Jonathan shares the most common CEO failure modes that he and his team have seen, the Magic Box paradigm for successfully selling your startup, a bunch of advice for finding and hiring the best talent, a framework for building a repeatable go-to-market motion, why and how you should learn to trust your intuition more as a founder and so much more. We could have gone on for so many more hours. Maybe he'll be back to share more advice. If you're a founder or hope to be a founder one day, this episode is for you.

Welcome to the podcast,

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:03):
Lenny, I am damn excited.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:05):
So am I. The reason I'm excited to have you in this podcast is that you basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, what causes them pain, what causes them to fail, what causes them to struggle, and then you take that and you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work with founders, and I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain? How do I avoid these things that I'm going to probably run into? To build on that, briefly, can you just help people understand what it is you do, what it is your organization does with founders, how you work with founders?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:38):
Yeah, thank you. I'll tell a bit of origin story that I think ends up answering that question.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):
Let's do it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:03:45):
I had run a bunch of different types of companies and they were really different ones. I ran a big division for a public company, then I was a private equity CEO, then I did back-to-back startups. The first one didn't get very far, but we sold it, and the second one got really far. When I left the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups, early stage, growth stage, when they were run well, they were all run well the same way?

(00:04:35):
I started to obsess about this question, and what it led me to realize is that every well-run company has a rhythm. It's unmistakable, you can't miss it. You can't not see it. You just spend a couple of days through a spy cam watching a business, you'll see the pattern. How come some startups get there and some don't? How does a founder learn the rhythm? How do they learn how to run a company well? I started to ask investors obsessively, and I asked them, Lenny, I asked them all three questions, same three over and over and over again.

(00:05:14):
First question was, well, describe to me your ideal founder. What's a great founder? The answers universally were the same. Investors would use words that meant grit and tenacity and courage and insight, and I'd say, "Great. Question number two, describe to me a great startup CEO," and they use none of those words. How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going.

Hi, Christina.

Christina Gilbert (00:07:57):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina Gilbert (00:08:15):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:37):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever?

Christina Gilbert (00:08:48):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co. That's OneSchema.co. There's obviously this new meme of founder mode. I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode. You basically have to be good at both. This latter part is almost manager mode. Is that a way to think about it?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:34):
Yes. Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):
Do share.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:09:42):
It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. If we think about an ascending startup, there's this phase of I have to invent something. I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.

(00:10:52):
The things required to launch a company are not the same as grow a company as scale a company as exit a company, and the best startup CEOs learn them all along the way. There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):
I love that. I'm glad we got there. I wasn't planning to talk about founder mode, but I think this is really helpful for folks to hear that are founders and people working for founders too. Along these same lines, you have a really helpful and really funny also mental model for how to think about common failure modes of founders. You have these labels that I love, and this is actually the first thing I heard about Enjoy The Work is these labels that you guys use, and you also, a similar mental model for failure modes for a startup. Can you just share these modes that you've come up with?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:12:31):
We do take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. As I've shared with you previously, the name of our company is not an accident. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves, so we do fuck around quite a bit. I think if I would separate failure modes for companies versus CEOs for a minute, the company ones are not quite as comedic, but they are ones we see all the time. One is you chose the wrong market. I don't think we need to belabor that one. Lots of your prior guests have talked about the importance of getting that part right or nothing else really matters.

(00:13:05):
Second, back to what we were discussing a minute ago, build something people want to buy, got to go build the right thing. Cool. Third one, founder's function. We like to joke that more companies die from suicide than homicide, and it's grim, but also if the two or three people in charge of the business can't get along, nothing else matters. It's all going to break apart. Then fourth, execution, and execution now leads back to CEO. Okay, so now we have a bunch of playful ones here. We have the robot CEO, who believes emotion should not ever exist at a startup, at which point we train them on a very simple formula. Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):
I love how engineering-oriented that advice is, which makes sense for robots. Yeah.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:14:03):
Also, a little bit more graceful of an answer there is also our CEOs want urgency and passion and excitement from their teams. They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have several robots working for us and you just press a button and they do a thing. Second one is a pleaser CEO. This is the person who is far more concerned with being liked than running a business, so they can't tell anyone hard news. They can't break ties, they want a consensus on everything, and that's not possible.

(00:14:56):
If you have a group of thoughtful people working for you, they're going to fight, they're going to debate and you want them to. Then at some point you have to call it and say, "No, we're going left not right." Or, "The two of you need to go get in a room and deal with something." Or, "Hey, the way you just showed up is not the way I want you to show up." The pleaser CEO won't do any of that. They will simply hide and pray It goes away and it won't go away. Next one is a perfectionist CEO. I'd like to say that these are the CEOs with the most beautiful product to be delivered minutes before they file for bankruptcy. This is the person who is far more concerned with being right and believing that there's always a right answer than just moving forward.

(00:15:36):
It creates two problems in a business. One is you're just slow and the other one is you'll never take any bets because you will build a team that realizes the CEO is not allowed to be wrong, so you can't disagree, you can't use intuition, you can't use gut. Everything has to be utterly factual and that is simply not possible. In early-stage startups, you have more questions than you do answers. Everything is circumstantial. It's not like watching CSI entrepreneurship and you get to see a video to say, "Oh, look, the guy did it." No, we have a bunch of little data points you have to come to a conclusion. The next one is the angry CEO.

(00:16:15):
I had a founder of mine a bunch of years ago and we were seeing a pattern across the leadership team and he and I get on the phone one morning and I said, "I have a theory for you. It might be a story, I might be wrong, but I want to share." He said, " Okay." I said, "I think you wake up in the morning angry and you don't know it, and then you get to the office and you beat the crap out of the first employee that crosses paths with you over something utterly unrelated because you're angry. You realize that a few hours later and you apologize and your team hasn't quit yet because they believe you're a good human who doesn't have good self-control." Then I shared with him, "And you just had your first child. My guess is because I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a therapist, that you are modeling something that's happened in your life. Is this something you want to change?"

(00:17:09):
His answer is yes, and I said, "Great. I have good news and bad news. The good news is because you said yes, we can do something about it, and the bad news is I don't know what to fucking do. That's not my job." The point being, no one wants to work for the angry person. I don't care what the equity potential is worth, no one wants to work for that person, and the moment they see greener pastures elsewhere, they're leaving. The next one is the one that drives me particularly crazy, it's the laissez-faire CEO, who insanely believes that I can just hire great people and utterly ignore them and let markets take care of themselves and they will do all the right things. I have never met anyone, Lenny, that didn't benefit from good management and the laissez-faire CEO believes that management is not required, and so what they ultimately find is they have really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved.

(00:17:59):
Every CEO we can reductively reduce to one of two characters. They're either comfortable with the brake or comfortable with the accelerator. The challenge with those who are comfortable with the brake, what I mean by that is they don't want to spend any money, so they're driving this beautiful sports car and they're just leaning on the brake the whole time. Yes, they won't run any money, and yes, they will also get lapped by everyone else and miss the opportunity. Where their opportunity is, is where can you take bets? Where can you actually downshift that car in such a way where you give yourself a chance in the market? Separate, those who ride the accelerator, we've all met this one. They're going to run out of money really fast, and this connects to one of our other challenging CEO types, the ready, fire, aim.

(00:18:49):
Most CEOs are really bad at planning and that's because there's this little-known secret in the Bay area, most CEOs have never run a business before. Planning doesn't have to be some heavy bureaucratic multi-month exercise that begins in August and ends in February, but a little bit of bottoms up planning to say, what are we trying to achieve? How do we quantify it? What resources are required? What humans are going to do what? How do we shorten feedback loops so we know in a week, in a month and two months, whether we're on the right trajectory? The ready, fire, aim CEO says, "I don't want to do any of that because they're improvisational and they just want to take bets and they want to take shots," and that's what got the company started, and that's also what will have the company go bankrupt. The micromanager one is the opposite of laissez-faire. They believe that no matter how many employees they have, they can do the job better.

(00:19:42):
The challenge with this one is it is massively disrespectful to those who work for you. We think that, and this is a bit insulting, that everyone that works for a founder can be fit into one or two chunks. They're either an adult or a child. I have a three-year-old, my little girl is amazing. I'm utterly in love. If she doesn't have a lot of structure and a lot of supervision, she's going to run into things, man. Into things, off things, through things, but adults don't need to be given utter instruction and watched all the time. In fact, it needs to be the opposite. We agree on what success is, what resources are, and you let them go and they'll come back to you when they have questions. The micromanager CEO doesn't see the difference between those two humans. They don't trust anybody and that's actually the thing under the thing under the thing, so they want to do everyone's work and that will succeed right up into the point everyone quits.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):
This is amazing. Okay, so let me recap these labels that you have just for folks. I have them written down here. There's the robot CEO, perfectionist CEO, pleaser CEO, micromanager, laissez-faire, ready, fire, aim, riding the brake and then riding the gas, and as you said, the ever-popular angry CEO.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:03):
You got them all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):
As people hear this, I imagine people self-identify a few of these, like I have some of this, I have some of that, and it's not like black or white. No one is like, "I'm a 100% robot CEO, and I need to fix that." It's like a pie chart kind of, I don't know, what's a visual of this? Everyone's got a little bit of this, basically.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:21:24):
That's right. I enjoy giving this talk on stage and watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments, but it doesn't mean that they're all one or the other. If they were all one of these and then didn't want to even accept the possibility that there's a little bit of a lot of these that they could work on, they're probably not coachable and they're not going to be in the talk anyway.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:45):
It's like I imagine each of these is very particular and it's this journey you go on to work on yourself. Let me just ask, what's the most common issue that you've found across these labels of type CEOs? What's the most common one and what do you often recommend someone to work on specifically to help them through that?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:22:02):
I think ready, fire, aim is the most common that we've seen, and that has been an affliction that's been growing in the last number of years. It wasn't long ago that CEOs could paper over poor execution with easy access to capital. Suddenly, over the last number of years, we're expecting founders to be better operators. Better operators means eventually being on a path when more cash comes into the business and out of the business. That doesn't happen by accident. The ready, fire, aim CEO has probably suffered this pain where they took lots and lots of bets. Maybe they measured the outcome after the fact and they were wrong and they were wrong and they were wrong in ways that were expensive, and they've raised their hand to say, "I see it. I want to get better at this." Basic, basic business design and business planning is not some corporate effort. It's some thoughtful exercise that starts with what are we working backwards from?

(00:23:02):
Because in any given time, Lenny, companies are working backwards from one of four things, whether they like it or not. I am working backwards from an exit. I'm working backwards from a next fundraise. I'm working backwards from profitability or I'm working backwards from winding down. We don't talk about the fourth one that much, but I got to choose one. I got to choose the top of the mountain. More often than not, they're choosing a fundraise. Then we'll ask that founder, you know your market, you know your investors, you know the next set of investors, we've done some intel. What has to be true to unlock the next fundraise? That's a qualitative and quantitative answer, but we write it down. We need to get better at go to market. We need to land our first partner. We need to launch next iteration of the product and show this level of efficacy, engagement, what have you. Can we codify that? Yes. Can we talk through what actions would be required on what cadence to unlock that quantified set of results? Yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:24:00):
... that quantified set of results? Yes. Do we understand what resources would be required to do those things? Recognize we might have to squint through some of it, but again, the answer is yes. [inaudible 00:24:13] now aimed. If we have a culture that has some accountability, that has a communication architecture, so there's some rituals about how we meet and how we share information and how we talk through problems, and how we work through bottlenecks, well, now we have a plan and now we have accountability. I now no longer have to just guess all the time. And this only works for the CEO who says, "My improvisational efforts got me here, but I don't think they'll get me there."

(00:24:47):
There's a guy I worked for a long time ago, and he had this phrase... He had like seven or eight phrases, he would use them over and over and over again. It was hard not to commit them all to memory, and one of them was, "If you keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting." And for the ready, fire, aim folks who realize the weakness of that at scale, the way to counteract that, is to start with good planning.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):
It's interesting that's the most common type of CO, when with Founder Mode, it feels like it just accelerates that further. The whole meme of Founder Mode, which are what makes you upset. Makes sense. Great.

(00:25:26):
Okay, so I love that you talked about exiting as basically one of these four working backwards paths, because that's where I wanted to go next. I want to talk about some of these specific frameworks and skills and methodologies that you teach, and one of them... I want to almost go to the end of selling your company. And the reason I'm excited to talk about this, is if you think about, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like most startups that succeed end up selling their company. That's the most likely success, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:25:58):
Yes, by far.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):
Great. Yeah, because the other option is IPO or just run this privately forever. Or fail, basically, and fold. So of the successful options, the most common is selling. At the same time, founders have never done this before, they don't know what they're doing. The other side, often, has done it many times, and so it's a pretty treacherous and scary and high-stakes thing to do and to learn on the spot. And you've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box Paradigm that I love, that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long term. Can you talk about what this is?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:26:36):
I can, and I want to give credit where it's due. There's a book by this name, it's called Magic Box Paradigm, written by an independent banker named Ezra Roizen. And the book's fantastic, and Ezra is fantastic.

(00:26:46):
What we've done, is we've operationalized it so that we could teach founders over, and over, and over again. If the founder wants to hire a banker for this particular process, because we're not bankers, we're not BD, we don't get paid that way, we're teachers. But if wanted to hire a banker, go hire Ezra. But the methodology itself is a inversion for how venture and venture boards have thought about startups being ready for sale for a long, long time. It's utterly counter to so much advice that founders have heard. There are two ways you can get acquired. This is purposely reductive. One is you put up a for-sale sign. This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you. You figure out the categories of buyers, the companies there, the contact list within that. You ping them and say, "We're open to a transaction," or some euphemism the like. You contact them and say, "I'll give you some information now. Sign an NDA. Give me an indication of interest by this date." And you work through a process, and you pray you have more than one person at the end of the game, try and ratchet them up, sign a term sheet. They will then re-trade along the way, right up until the point you die and you hope you get a deal done.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):
Sounds very familiar.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:28:08):
And it's one that often will just hit the nervous system of any founder that's been through it a couple of times. Because man, is it a fraught exercise? What Magic Box argues, is that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.

(00:28:43):
All right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage startup, and you meet a company that is in your space, in your vertical, what have you, and they're much more advanced than you. It's a large business. Generally speaking, another oversimplification here, large companies are interested in small companies because they're technology. And small companies are interested in large companies because they're distribution. And there's someone at the large company who becomes fascinated with you.

(00:29:12):
What's the fascination? What they see in their head is, "Oh, interesting. If I buy your company, this thing happens." The classic example of this is Instagram. This is the number one example of this. Lenny, do you remember how much revenue they had when they got acquired by now Meta?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):
I think it was zero.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:34):
I think it was zero.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:35):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:36):
Do you remember the acquisition price?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):
A billion dollars, which was absurd at that point.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:29:41):
There was no math Facebook could use, historically speaking, that would justify a billion dollars. It had to be a model on the future. This is Magic Box to a T. They had a fantasy that adding Instagram would expand ad revenue. They figured out some way to prove it. I'll explain more on what I mean by proof. And then their quantification was based on the future. And that's the difference between a Magic Box approach and traditional approaches. Traditional approaches are based on the past, Magic Box is on the future.

(00:30:14):
Let me tell a story. In one of our companies in construction tech, their technology was able to suck in video camera data from construction sites for project planning. No one was doing this yet. And the business was doing pretty well. We helped the founders launch the company. We got first product in market. We raised a couple of rounds of capital. The product mostly worked. But we weren't sure it was venture scale as we were going along. And we had some large construction tech companies and real estate companies and development companies leaning into us. And one particular company then said, "Huh, we're really good at construction planning, and we've collected all of this video data that we don't use at all." And the champion on the other side in the product org, he has a fantasy. "Oh, shit. We take your video analytics platform and plug it into what we do, and this is what happens to my business."

(00:31:18):
Now, the person on the other side is a person. And the reason I'm being specific about that, is because you don't sell to a company. Magic Box is about finding the person. You're finding the champion on the other side, the person who has motivated for their own reasons, career, money, reputation, what have you. They see the fantasy. They fall in love. And this person says, "I am in love with this idea. If I can grab security data into my product organization. Now I have to prove the fantasy."

(00:31:53):
What's different about a champion in this kind of process, is they want to find a way to say yes. They're not looking for a way to say no. And this brings us to the four characters you're going to meet along the path of Magic Box. There might be a fifth. You're going to meet your champion, you're going to meet your advocates, you're going to meet your blockers, and you're going to meet your buyer. You might meet Corp Dev along the way.

(00:32:20):
Let me talk about each of those folks. The champion is the one who's fallen in love. They're the ones with the fantasy. They're the ones who are arguing on your behalf. They're the ones fighting for you when you're not in the room. They are texting you, they're telling you things about the business that they're probably not supposed to tell you.

(00:32:33):
The buyer. All they care about is math. It might be a committee, it might be a group, the IC, the EC, the investment group, what have you. They're the ones who actually can sign off on a deal. They care about business case.

(00:32:45):
Advocates... Lenny, do you play chess?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:49):
I have played chess, yes.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:32:50):
You have played chess. So advocates are pawns. They don't matter at all until they matter enormously. These are folks that, like, you are the CEO doing a meeting with your potential buyer, and there are somehow 12 people on the Zoom call, but only two do the talking. The other 10 might be advocates. They're rooting for you, but they will take no political risk. Their value is in giving you intel.

(00:33:16):
Blocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your champion just wants you to get the deal done so in love. So what happens, is they've come up with a fantasy and you as a CEO need to lean into it. This isn't enterprise selling. I'm not trying to sell you this thing that I have. I'm just trying to find ways to say yes.

(00:33:47):
So when, in my story, the person says, "Could we provide you all of our video data that we've collected forever and you now could enhance our ability to predict whether large- scale construction projects are on time"? I don't want the CEO saying anything other than, "We can do that."

(00:34:07):
Now, phase two, I need to prove it. Okay, because I have a champion who wants to say yes, proof can be really easy. And the reason the proof is so important, is not to convince the champion they're in love with the fantasy. They're already convinced. It's because in almost all cases, big company is buying little company and your champion doesn't have unilateral authority. They're going to socialize the deal. They have to get buy-in from who? The aforementioned buyer. They have to be able to survive the aforementioned blockers.

(00:34:43):
So eventually, when they pitch this to whatever committee is in charge, that committee is going to say, "What proof do we have that it works?" And we just want to be able to provide the champion with enough evidence that it works. So in this case, we said to the champion, " Well, give us video data, and we will provide you the evidence that you need." Because we're dealing with a champion who's not a cynic, because champions aren't, we could tell them, "And provide us the data in this way, in this fashion, and here's what we'll send you after. Are we in agreement?" We know we're already going to win the proof, and it's critically important in these dances.

(00:35:27):
Number three, quantify. At this point, we're not up for sale, but we're spending a lot of calories on somebody, and they know it. So we have our CEOs say the following phrase to them: "My board is asking questions. They're wondering why we're spending so many calories on this when it's not really core and we're not selling you our product. I'm convinced of how exciting this could be, together, but I think we need to do some math. So I can explain to my board why this might matter. So let's imagine all this works, because it's going to work, and it's a year from now or five years from now. What changes about your business?" And the champion will tell you, "Retention does this, or deal size goes like this, or market share goes like this." And you'll say to them, "Fantastic. Look, I'm going to build some shitty verse version of the model. You tell me what I got right and what I got wrong, but I have a board meeting in 16 days, and I need to be able to walk them through the justify why I am spending so many calories on this exercise."

(00:36:34):
You build the model, you hand it to them. If they in any way respond to your model, you've won. Because you have now divorced history from future, and you are now playing in future, you are playing the Instagram game in this case. The ending of the story for the company that I was describing, it was a business sub 2 million in revenue. Our prospects of raising series B felt low. We were not yet profitable, and that was an exit that was generational wealth for the co-founders and their families. The CEO went on and spent two-plus years with the now public company that did this acquisition. The technology did get integrated, but it took a long time and they had to do a lot of changes to it, certainly beyond what was envisioned during the diligence process. But all parties are happy. And if we hadn't done it this way and we had just been up for sale, we'd get a dollar for that company.

(00:37:40):
A couple of other side points that are really important here. For any of you founders out there that are thinking about working backwards from an exit, there are two things that I really want to stress. One is the fantasy is beyond just, "What is the business change you can have?" The fantasy is, "Your books are in order." Your fantasy is all of your investors will sign off on the deal and you will have unanimous consent, that the key members of your team are going to stick around, that you're a joy to work with. Please God, founder, do not puncture the fantasy at any time.

(00:38:21):
So whatever is starting to shape in your buyer's mind, get to know it. Live that everybody wins from that game. Second, Corp Dev, they will probably show up in the stands. Corp Dev make deals. They're not deal sponsors, they're not a champion, they're not a buyer. They are an expert negotiator. Their job is to facilitate deals and get deals done. The most important things to understand is that they can be a leverage point to have a deal move with some process and some pace and some urgency. Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.

(00:39:04):
Second, they are way better at negotiating than you. So anytime dealing with a superior negotiator, the only thing you can do to try and even the scales, is move the negotiation async. So founders, repeat after me, I'm talking to you directly now. You'll say to Corp Dev, "You know I'm not alone in this decision. I love what you just said and I'm excited about this opportunity. Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with advisors, lawyers, co-founders, whoever." But don't negotiate live. You will lose.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):
Let me just say that was extremely delightful to listen to. I've never heard like a M&A strategy be this fun. And it makes me want to sell a company. It's like, "Okay, let's do this. I'm hyped." I think you got it all. I have a few questions.

(00:39:56):
Interestingly, the middle part is... It feels a lot like enterprise sales, which a lot of founders are used to. Understand the stakeholders move things forward. Here's your champion, here's your blockers, here's the buyer. Is there anything there you want to say, what's maybe most different from enterprise sales, which I think a lot of founders are maybe used to? Or is it pretty similar?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:40:14):
Yeah, I think three things. One is there are a lot of moments in enterprise sales where we're trying to push for a compelling event. That doesn't work in seduction. The playful metaphor that we'll often use, is you've been dating for a while, this person could be the person, but they're not quite convinced yet that it should be a life together, and you're sitting at dinner. And in enterprise sales, you're eager to get it done. You're eager to move the relationship forward and move in and get engaged, what have you. And so you might be inclined to say, "Hey, either we move this relationship the next step, or there are a whole bunch of people eyeing me, and I'm going to go date someone else."

(00:41:06):
That conversation never goes well, and in Magic Box founders are eager to do the same thing, thinking that competition will improve their deal size, when in fact I think more often than not, that is a negative signal until the very end of the dance. So instead in enterprise selling where I'm pushing, in Magic Box, I'm always trying to entice, I'm never, ever trying to push. So instead I might say things like, "Hey, I'm going to raise my next round in Q1, because I've been intending to do this business independently. Now all I really want to do, is win. I just want my product in as many customers' hands as possible. Whether I do that on my own as I was planning, in partnership with someone, or under someone else's roof, honestly I don't care. But I have a company to run and I'm going to go raise my next round in Q1. And if I do that, probably too expensive for this deal to make sense anymore, and my board will want me to move on anyway." I'm enticing. I'm never trying to push.

(00:43:08):
Okay, so I'm thinking about as a founder hearing this, and I feel like what they're probably wondering is that first step of finding that person, starting to build this fantasy. Any advice you could share for a founder that's like, "We probably need to sell this company"? What can they do to start creating these relationships, find this person, create this fantasy in their minds?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:43:28):
Ezra does this really well in the book. Again, it has to be not solicitous. So one of our companies, we had maybe 20 months of capital left, and the two co-founders and our team were convinced, "This isn't a venture business. We thought it might be a venture business. It's not a venture business. It takes too long to do a deal that's not that interesting with each of our enterprise customers." It was disappointing, but at least we were honest about it. "Okay, so who are we going to sell to? Let's go play this game."

(00:44:04):
So we started with categories, categories of buyers. It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer. There were a few different categories. And we said, "Great. Who are the companies within those categories that make sense?" They're acquisitive, they have the balance sheet for it. There's a Corp Dev department, so we know that they actually know what they're talking about here. Ideally, there's an existing relationship with core team or advisors or board members. Make a list.

(00:44:45):
Now, how do we meet them in a way without selling them? So one of the examples in the book, which I love, is small startup wants to meet the luminaries in a space, and they have their PR agency set up a panel where they contact the CEOs of the potential buyers and say, "We're putting together a panel of the world's foremost experts in X. We're going to put four people on the panel, and it's going to be you and famous person number two and famous person number three, and this fourth person," that is a luminary to us. And it's our startup CEO. And suddenly you're at the table as a peer. It's a completely different conversation.

(00:45:32):
The second one, and this is going to sound a little silly, but I am not exaggerating, it works. If you are a CEO founder and you have that title on LinkedIn, it's amazing the responses you'll get. So we made this list and we just started to send connection requests to the CEOs or CPOs or CFOs on our target list, and said something as simple as this, "You're doing something really cool. So are we. You game just for a 30-minute chat? Because I don't know where it'll go, but I think it'll be fun." Keep it that informal. It's peer to peer. I'm not selling you anything.

(00:46:10):
If you can draw a line to some post that they had or some speech that they gave, even better. But we found without fail, there would be math that would show up, one out of four, one out of five, or one out of six, "Yeah, that sounds fun." There's a lot of those CEOs never talk to startups, and that's fascinating to them, especially when presented with the energy of, "I just want to have a fun, intellectual discussion."

(00:46:37):
What you're looking for in that first conversation, and this is what we ask our CEOs to do, is to ask questions like, "What do you care most about in the next year? What's the mandate? What about for your department? What are the things that keep you up at night? What's the break? What's the thing that could actually kill everything, if you had a pre-mortem for the next year?" Those kind of open-ended questions, because what we want our CEO listening for, is the fantasy to see if there's some intersection between what they care about and what we might be able to squint and say we do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):
It's interesting, because it sounds a lot like there's a jobs-to-be-done framework here, or just like, "What is the job they need done?" What is the pain you're going to solve, and then create a fantasy around how amazing it'll be for them if you can solve that problem.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:47:19):
And ideally they'll say it and you just reflect it back in active listening.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):
Chris Voss negotiation style. Okay, so you're the kind of guest, Jonathan, where the whole podcast could be about each one of these topics, and so I know there's so much more to talk about here. I want to move to a different topic, but to leave folks with, one is if they want to explore this methodology more, there's a book you mentioned, called Magic Box Paradigm by Ezra Roizen, right?

(00:47:51):
If companies are in this process, starting to think about it, does it make sense for them to come to you and like, "Hey, help me through this process"? I know you said, "Go to an investment banker." Or does it make sense to like, "Hey, let's bring on Jonathan," or someone from your team to help them?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):
It makes sense to like, Hey, let's bring on Jonathan or someone from your team to help them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:48:03):
We meet two types of founders. Founder one says, fix this part of my business, totally transactional. I want to raise the next round, or I'm hiring people badly or my founders aren't getting along, or I want to sell my company. Well, I need to be honest, that's not interesting to us. That's not our work. Go find someone who is, and I don't mean this disparagingly, but like a screwdriver, like fixes one thing, go fix one thing. Then we meet second type of founder and that founder says, most likely to themselves, 'cause it's the only safe audience. There's some gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be. There are a set of skills that I'm great at and there are these things where I know if I'm really honest with myself, if I listen to the quiet voice, I'm soft at these things or I'm not good enough at these things or I have some imposter syndrome about these things and if I don't get better at them, danger. That's the one we work with. And it's when they care that much about both the hard skill development and maybe the soft skill development in their path to become a great CEO.

(00:49:10):
How to sell the company. It's one of the skills. We teach this to all of our founders as well as hiring and management and planning. I don't care what the thing is. For every one of our founders, we audit them and say, here's what you're great at, here's what you're shitty at, and here's what you've never done before, and which of these do you want to work on next given where the company is in its cycle.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):
Great segue to where I wanted to go with this, which is hiring. So I hear all the time that a founder's core job is fundraising and hiring an amazing team. Basically that's their main goal. Just like hire amazing people. The people you hire make your company, create the culture. You got to get that right. But similar to trying to sell your company, most founders have never really hired lots of people, they've never hired for all these different skill sets they're trying to hire for and I know that you guys spend a lot of time helping founders hire and find amazing people. Can you just share some of the advice you share with founders for how to find and hire amazing people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:06):
Yeah, so we actually think the CEO has three jobs. We agree with the two that you said, but we think there's a third. One is, make sure everyone knows where we're going. The second one, pick the right people for the team. Third one, give those people the tools they need to win. And you can abstract from those what they all mean, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:50:28):
... most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases. The lazy ones, back to laissez-faire, think it's just gambling like, oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them, just gambling. There was work done by and then codified in a beautiful book. I'm going to make sure I get the names right, Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street. They had a consulting firm that dates back to the mid-nineties. Then they wrote a book in 2007 or 2008 called Who: The A Method for Hiring. We have operationalized that book and then expanded on it 'cause there are some parts of it that we found a little dated, but it's really still as applicable today as it ever was.

(00:51:18):
And I think there are three core mistakes that founders make all the time, that can be really easily rectified. The first one is, you should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next. And I know that sounds simple, but founders don't think of hiring that way. They start with a job description. We've been taught that for a long time. Start with the job description. It's a fucking mistake. Start with, it's 12 months later, you hired the person, they started today, 12 months have gone by, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What's changed about the business? What does success look like 12 months later? Document it. And then when you interview people, look for people that have already done that stuff.

(00:52:13):
Second, the notion of does the person in front of you have a history of creating raving fans? They talk in the book about this idea of you being pulled or pushed in your career. If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great. And if you see a history of that, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, really attractive candidate. Third, core values matter a lot. Culture is not an accident. Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent. But that also means you need a methodology for evaluating the next human in front of you on whether they actually represent your values. We think of these interview stages in a way similar to the book, we use slightly different language, but we think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):
Funny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was formed around studying what the founders Brian, and Joe, and Nate valued specifically and then they codified them to core values at the business and then there's this team that was a very select handpicked team that at every interview loop interviewed the person for their values.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:54:22):
That is a beautiful example of how interviewing for values is independent of title. 'Cause you'll find people in the company at every stage of a company that are the best ambassadors, the best embodiments of those values. Please use them for interviewing and in addition, they love it 'cause they're protecting their castle. They love where they work, they want to keep it that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):
So true that team is a real special team and it was really honored to be on that team. So let me summarize what you just shared, which I love. There's so much value here, it just keeps going and going. So when you're hiring, your advice is: look for people, one, that have done it before; two, that have been pulled from job to job by someone else that loves their work and wants them to be with them at this new company. And then three, their values match the values of the founder and the business essentially, right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:11):
Yes. And for the recruiters out there, a really simple way to get rid of a lot of the crap that ends up showing up at the top of the funnel is just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):
So a couple of follow-up questions here. One is, this point of hiring people that have done it, obviously this implies don't hire junior up-and-comers as much. Thoughts on just when it makes sense to hire someone more junior that's really ambitious, real smart, you think they can learn the job, thoughts there?

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:55:53):
So one of our companies is hiring a team of reasonably junior account execs. We're looking for folks that have been out of school for two years. Now, that means they are highly unlikely to have had three years of quota achievements and a similar... you get the point. Okay, so how do you hire someone who's already done it? We know what success looks like 12 months later. For that role, they've learned how to hunt, they've been able to create pipeline of X and close Y in business, et cetera. What we are looking for then in their history, if they have any sales chops of any kind. They could be selling Girl Scout cookies, or tickets to some event, or they work for a non-profit for while. I don't care, but I want some evidence that they've sold. I want some evidence that they're comfortable getting on the phone or showing up at meetings or showing up at events. So, that they've done it before should be reviewed or thought of creatively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):
Got it.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:57:07):
Now for more senior roles, I want an explicit. We think of, for example, for executives, Lenny, we think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler. The architect, let's use sales as an example. This is someone who has to build a playbook. So they're going to uncomfortably stay close to the founder, watch and listen, and listen to recordings and pick their brain to pull the magic from the founder of like, oh, here's the dance that she or he goes through to actually close a deal and they write first playbook. And the goal of the codification of that is so you can bring on a first account exec and the next account exec because account execs back to our language earlier in this adult children dynamic are children. You need to give them structure for them to win. That's the architect. The optimizer, this is someone who's now going from a few account execs to maybe 10, 15 and we now have targets we have to hit. The business is now reaching a different level of professionalism and expectation and you have to optimize that earlier playbook to try and find more efficiency and performance out of it.

(00:58:21):
The scaler is saying, okay, now how do I find leverage? How do I have 10X more account execs or how to get other people to sell for me? They're all going to be called VP of sales or chief revenue officer. They're completely different archetypes, and that same person exists in engineering and in product, et cetera. In those cases, I only would want to bring on an architect if they'd been an architect before. If they'd only been an optimizer, they're going to fail because they've never written playbook from scratch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):
It touches on a conversation I had recently. It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the wrong one of those buckets, essentially. Like you enjoy certain type of work and your job is not doing that type of work, whether it's in your case scaling or optimizing. And so, it just reminds that if you're frustrated at work, you're in the wrong job in terms of the type of output they're trying to expect from you.

Jonathan Lowenhar (00:59:18):
The story in my head is that talking to me and my colleagues sometimes can feel a little like death by frameworks. We have one for everything and in this example, I think if you're going to be sustainably successful in any kind of job, I don't care what it is, three things have to be true. You have to be good at it, you have to like it, and the market has to give a shit about it. And if one of those is off, you're not staying in that job long.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):
Yeah. And this touches on the name of your firm, Enjoy The Work, got to enjoy the work to make it sustainable. Okay, one other thing. So one other follow up question real quick on the hiring and then I want to talk about one other bucket of work. And again, I think each of these could be like an hour, two hour long podcast conversation. I love that there's this recurring theme of working backwards to inform what you do today. So earlier you talked about working backwards from what the outcome you want next for your business, whether it's fundraising or exit or winding down. And for hiring, you have the similar advice, work backwards from what you want this person to achieve in the first year, whether it's drive this sort of growth in the product or drive sales. I guess anything else there of just the power of working backwards versus the typical approach for hiring, you talked about job descriptions.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:00:26):
Hiring is never the goal and it's often the first thing that we'll hear from a founder, "I have to hire this person." One, that is so dangerous for confirmation bias. The hiring manager is always the one most burdened by that particular bias, but it's also hiring is never the goal. We will pull them back to over and over and over again, which of the three milestones matter, right? Fundraise, exit, profitability. What has to change about the business, for example, to get to that fundraise? How do we quantify that change? Some sort of goal setting framework. OKRs, EOs, I don't care. All goal setting frameworks have the same bones. There's some description of it, there's some quantification of it, there's some work that has to be done. There's some accountability rituals with clear owners and clear agreements.

(01:01:18):
So once I actually have the quantification of here's what work needs to be done, I now know what resources I need to be able to pull that work forward and therefore now I know what kind of humans I need, whether I'm hiring or renting. And that should drive the conversation, not the, "Oh God, I need another PM." It's no, here's the set of features that we've said matter most this year. Here's the gap in the resources we have and the resources we need, that's why we're hiring this role. And here's what success would look like 12 months from now or six months from now. So they're tying back to what would change about the business.

(01:01:57):
And this is this recurring theme of our work with our founders. They're so in it Lenny that they rarely have time to sit above what they're working on. This notion of working in the business versus on the business. And so much of our work is to separate them from the day-to-day, which is enormously important, not in any way denigrating it, and I need to know where I'm headed and why, and how I'm going to measure progress along the way. And so, so much of what we're doing with them is to say, I want to hear from you what you think success looks like. I'm going to push back and pressure test a bunch of things. Can we define that in a way? Can we agree on who needs to do the work along the way, and how we're going to keep checking on it to keep feedback loop short? Now we can go back into business and then we'll check again in a week or in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):
I love that. That's actually a great segue to the final bucket I want to spend some time on which is growth and go to market. Another area that many founders have never worked on before. A lot of founders are like, Hey, I have this awesome idea. I'm going to build this awesome product. I know how to do that. I know what market needs. But building a go-to-market motion to get it into people's hands is a whole different skill. We spent a lot of time on this on the podcast, you have a really cool simple framework of just how to think about go-to-market. There's all this like, oh, you need a go-to-market strategy. Talk about how you talk to founders about thinking about what it takes to put together a go-to-market plan and how to make it a repeatable motion versus just I'm just going to go to people and try to sell them.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:03:37):
Our founders, even the most capable of them find this topic pretty overwhelming because it branches into so many areas. So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks. We think of it in four pieces. The first piece is ideal customer profile. Who do we really want to sell to? What are their qualifications? What are the discovery questions we would use to get to those qualifications? What are the kill criteria to know that this is [inaudible 01:04:10] fool's goal, this really isn't the human?

(01:04:13):
Second bucket, loosely called marketing. But within that marketing is also positioning. So what is our uncommon denominator from the enemies? So who are we competing against? Is it actual companies or is it status quo in some sort? What are they great at? What are we great at? What are we great at that they're not? Then how do we represent that in the world? That's branding and artifacts and identity work, et cetera.

(01:04:44):
Next is demand gen, which we'll simplify to say, how do we go find the humans we want? I've long loved the book Traction that Gabriel Weinberg... I'm going to forget unfortunately the co-author's name right now, Jason Mares? Sorry. Where they talk about the 19 channels that all companies have availability to, they're the same ones. Now the book has got a couple of years on it, so there are a couple of new channels that have popped out since, but what we then try and expand the aperture for our founders is rather than just think about meeting your next customer through however you did at your last company, availability bias, instead, which of these might make most sense next? A simple two by two matrix can work here like some experimentation, some brain writing. Love brain writing, not brainstorming. I know you've talked about that on prior pods. And then high impact, low effort. Can we think of the three or four experiments we want to run by channel? Let's go play.

(01:05:48):
And then fourth, sales. And this is the codification of a playbook. How are we having the conversation? How are we doing discovery? How are we handling objections? How are we doing demo? How are we moving to close? If we can get through those four, then we can start to talk about deployment and customer success and upselling and account management, et cetera, et cetera. Those are good problems to have. Oh my god, my install base is so large, I need to manage it. Great, great fricking problem. But we try and break this complexity of going from individually selling to building a machine into just these four buckets. Who am I selling to? What do we want to say about ourselves? How do we reach them? How do we close them?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):
Amazing. I was going to summarize that. You did an excellent job there. Before we follow up on this, you mentioned this term brain writing. What does that mean?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:35):
Oh, first time I heard of this was Adam Grant. I don't know if he's the originator of the idea. Brainstorming, you talked about this a bit in your Annie Duke podcast as well of how horribly coercive meetings can be.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):
For brainstorming, especially.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:06:56):
For brainstorming especially. And so, what many of our founders don't recognize because they just see like, Hey, I'm just sitting around a table with a group of folks I respect, so we can just debate things as peers. No, you can't. You're a founder. Your voice has a megaphone attached to it even if you can't hear it. So you have to turn down the megaphone if you actually want to learn what your people have to say. So brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... it could be in a survey, it could be in a shared doc, what have you, my preferences in through some sort of methodology, you are now sharing your opinions, comments, edits, dreams, in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified.

(01:07:50):
Then when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass. Let everyone read the thing. I even like the Amazon, take the first 10 minutes of a meeting, let's just go read so we're all fully present and then have a debate. What it allows for is the dampening of the founder effect in meetings.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):
You're just so full of golden nuggets. That's just like a random tangent that I think could be really transformative for a lot of teams. So the advice here is just when you're trying to ideate and brainstorm, don't go in a big room and put post- its on a wall and talk throughout ideas and have a discussion. Instead, just everyone individually sits and thinks and shares their thoughts and the founder presents, here's a problem, here's a question we're trying to tackle.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:08:39):
What it also allows for is an evening of the playing field between fast processors and slow processors, introverts and extroverts, because they're all equally potentially talented in your room, but if you do live brainstorming, you have diminished all the folks that prefer to sit and chew on something first.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:02):
That's very much me. That's exactly how I operate. I need to think and process. I'm not on the spot quick thinker person. So 100% fan of this approach. Let me come back to your go-to-market framework. I have the notes pulled up here. So basically if you're a founder or even a product builder and you're trying to think about how do I... people keep telling me I need a go to market plan, I need to grow this thing. How do I think about this? You're basically saying there's these four buckets to think about; who are you selling to? How are you going to motivate them and get them excited to buy your thing? How do you reach them? And then how do you close them?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:09:37):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):
Luckily I have podcasts and newsletter posts on every single one of these buckets, if folks want to pursue each one of these. I have templates for ICPs, marketing advice, all these things. So that's good news. There's a lot of content for people to read if they want to explore this stuff. Let me ask you, where do you often find the biggest bang for your buck when you come to a founder or if founder comes to you and they're like, I need to figure out, go-to-market motions? Just start from the top and work your way down. Or is there, here's where maybe you want to spend a lot of time.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:10:10):
Early stage founders, and this is certainly more true for the first timers Lenny than the veterans 'cause they learn this problem. The first timers are like twenty-something year olds in a bar and they're being social for the first time in their lives, and anyone that makes eye contact with them is enough for them to say, I want to go on a date with you. That's it. There's no discrimination of any kind, like, oh my god, they like me, I'm in. That's the mistake that hounds first timers. The veterans and those we get our hands on. Instead, we say, let's imagine you could build your perfect customer in a lab, like a Petri dish and you grew them, what do they look like? And if you have any kind of install base, I'll ask the question. I just did this with the founder the other day. They are enterprise whale hunting business. They have four large customers.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:13):
Wait, actually whale... okay, whale hunting in terms of large wealth person or actual whales?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:21):
The extreme of enterprise selling.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Okay, okay, got it. I want to see a whale hunting startup. Okay, go on.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:11:29):
I said, so which of your four customers is your favorite? Which one, if I got them on the phone, they would rave about you. They would be salivating openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them. And they was like, oh, that's clear. It's this one of the four. Great. Tell me about them. And what you start to see and pull apart from that is the founder does have an ideal profile. They do have a dream. Now, there are all sorts of risks about is the world too small? Is it not a big enough market if they get too tight, and founders get so caught up in that and it's a mistake because all we're-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:12:00):
... so caught up in that, and it's a mistake. Because all we're looking for in the beginning is a white-hot center of opportunity, a small population that is an enormous fan that's getting enormous impact. We can worry about adjacencies and expansion later. I like to remind them that Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it. So where the founders often get hung up on for us is that they've moved towards selling without contemplating ideal customer profile, without contemplating qualifications, without contemplating discovery questions that get to that. And most importantly, kill criteria, if this is true do not sign them, even if they want to go out on a date with you.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):
I'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I believe and I hear often on this podcast is how underappreciated picking your customers in early leads are. And if you think about this funnel you described, figure out who you're selling to, how do you motivate them, find them and then sell them, all this trickles down from who are you going after. You will know how to motivate them if you know who you're talking to versus the opposite. If you're talking to everyone-

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:11):
It's the most expensive mistake of those four.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:15):
Okay. Is there anything else on go-to-market or growth you think might be helpful just to touch on before we close up our conversation?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:13:25):
The one thing I'll share, this goes back to the ready, fire, aim that we talked about earlier, is that there's implicitly a funnel, mathematical funnel, to what we just described. And founders often make the mistake when planning for the year ahead of I need to be at this revenue to justify this multiple. And then all of the funnel math is a plug, and that's death, as opposed to here's what's been true for the last three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. And then what assumptions can I reasonably make with ways I'm going to influence that funnel going forward, to go build up to where I think I'll be a year from now? And it just lowers the bias that your planning process operates with.

(01:14:15):
But when a founder starts from a place of, "I have to get to 3 million or we're dead," you're already dead. As opposed to what do I really believe I can do to get there, changing top of the funnel, changing conversion rates along the way, changing a deal size or deal length, et cetera based on my recent history, and then have a conversation about the gap between where I think the business reasonably can get with some ambition, and where I think I need to be financially, because that's the more mature conversation and that's the one the ready, fire, aim CEO doesn't have. That's the one most founders have only started to learn to have over the last few years when capital dried up.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):
I love that. I love just how practical and real talk your advice always ends up being. Speaking of that, I emailed a founder that you work with and asked him, "What should I ask? What should I ask Jonathan when he comes on the podcast?"

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:14:57):
Uh-oh.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):
And he said something that was really... That's great. It was really unexpected what he said. He said that the biggest lesson he learned from you is to, as a founder, to trust his intuition more throughout the journey of his startup. Can you just talk about that as something you've learned, something you've seen, that maybe founders under appreciate?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:15:31):
It's impossible not to be a startup CEO and not face many existential moments. Is my company going to survive? Did I make a mistake? Will I ever be hired again? Should I sell the company now? Should I break up with a co-founder? Should I fire this critical employee? They happen to all of us. And fear is not a good decision maker. Our lizard brain is a really bad decision maker in those moments.

(01:16:07):
And so what we'll often share with the founder who's facing one of these scenarios, and I know the CEO you're describing and he's facing one of these scenarios, we'll say to them, "Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one." And most of the time, Lenny, when I frame it that way the person across me says, "Yeah, I know that voice." And I'll ask, "How do you hear it?" And they're usually some version of, "I have to get really alone, really still, really quiet, walk on the beach, listen to music, work out, play with my pet."

(01:17:06):
I said that voice is who you are. It's not your brain. Your brain is a tool. It's our hands, it's our feet, just a tool. It's a pattern recognition machine. But who you are, if you can watch your brain, you know what you're thinking, like, oh, look what my brain's doing. That means you're not your brain. It's something else. And that's the little voice, and that little voice is going to be right. And where we get screwed up in life is when we stop listening to that voice, when the mania of our chaos of our lives get in the way of that voice.

(01:17:42):
And so whenever our founders face one of those moments, it's not a framework, it's not a playbook, or even a directed piece of advice from us to say, "You should just go left. I've seen this before. Go left." Nope. I trust founder intuition. If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in. We're just here to support them. And we try and be the only person in their life that is fully on their team because we're not on the preferred side of the CAFS table. We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, "Can you get really quiet?"

(01:18:21):
And the founder you're talking about, I have the story in my head, he was facing a breakup moment with his co-founder, and I asked him, because he's good at getting quiet, "What did the voice say to you way back when?" And the voice said to him, "This is the wrong fit. This isn't going to work. He believes in different things than I do, and that's going to go badly." But the lizard brain didn't want to believe that, and so it took another year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:18:58):
Wow. I had tingles throughout that entire piece of advice. I love how it's also very applicable to just life, not even just being a founder. It's a good reminder to trust that voice more. It's interesting that this also connects to founder-mode a little bit, and I'm curious how you think about that where a lot of the founder-mode advice is like trust your judgment, don't hire people to delegate things away. Do you see a difference in the core idea of founder-mode and just like, but you should actually trust your intuition more?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:19:35):
Intuition comes from, in my point of view, a deep understanding of self, and the capacity to get quiet and be well resourced, meaning you've slept well and you've eaten well and you have enough love in your world. And I think what founder-mode can confuse is my intuition says I should just do this job for them and fire these three people. That's not intuition, that's reaction, that's a fear response. And when the founder says, "I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it. I need to terminate my whole go-to-market team and start over. This isn't working, and I have data that supports it, but I know this isn't working." I'm like, "Let's go with that. I'm in. Let's do it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):
And I think you described a lot of times people feel this, and it takes a year, two years, three years, many years to actually realize that. And your advice here is try to listen to that more and trust it more. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, Jonathan to pivot our energy, is there anything else want to leave listeners with, last piece of advice, anything that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:21:04):
To be a founder is a state of being. It's an attitude, it's courage, it's instinct, it's a capacity to push through, despite all sorts of evidence suggesting you're wasting your time. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be. And so what I would encourage every founder out there that wants to go build something substantial, go work on your craft in addition to working on the business. Be honest with yourself about here's the shit I'm bad at. I don't know how to read a financial statement. My board meetings suck. Half my meetings that I have with my leadership team we all walk out of there saying what did we just accomplish right now? Or I get to the end of my workday and I'm like, I didn't get anything done. Those are all examples of just not taking the craft seriously enough. I'll leave with that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):
I love that. And I think I've made the mistake during our conversation of confusing founder and CEO and assuming they're the same thing, and I really appreciate you just again pointing out to folks that that's the big distinction you got to start making is there's the founder and there's the CEO. Often they're same person, but different parts of your brain and different skill sets.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:36):
And I'm now fully off the very awkward soapbox I've been sitting on for a long time, so we can go to lightning round whenever you're ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):
With that, we've reached our very exciting lighting round. Jonathan, are you ready?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:48):
I'm ready. I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):
First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:22:54):
My number one business book that I've recommended would be Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. I do think it always comes back to team. The right team can solve all the things. And that book is a beautiful distillation of the most common problematic archetypes that show up in a leadership group. So that's the number one.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):
Amazing. Anything else you'd recommend?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:19):
The second one, it goes more personal. It's a book called Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. It was, at least for me, the first introduction to this idea that I am not my brain and that my brain can be a tool that serves me well, and at times doesn't. So that would be number two.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):
I've started to read that book and then I never finished it, so this is a good reminder to give it another shot. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:23:50):
I just watched and really enjoyed, because by the way, I have a three-year-old at home, so the amount of content I now consume is reduced tremendously. Well, my wife and I just watched Will & Harper. This is the documentary between Will Ferrell and his very dear friend who just recently transitioned. They road trip across the country together, and it was freaking delightful. It was sweet and endearing and one of the better things I've watched in a while.

(01:24:19):
TV show, Slow Horses, I'm utterly addicted. I'm only midway through season two, but I've been voraciously sleeping less and watching more.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:31):
I love both those. I just watched Will & Harper, and completely agree with your sentiment about it. I wasn't planning to watch it. My mother-in-Law started watching. I'm like, wow, this is really fun. It's also funny, meaningful funny.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:24:43):
There's so many moments in it that are really sweet. As an aside, this was '20, I don't know, April 2020, and a group of our very close friends said, "Hey, how are we going to keep in touch?" And so we started what we called Movie Club, and we routinely either pick a TV show or a movie. We all watch separately and every two weeks we get together on Zoom at night, we talk about what we just watched.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):
I love that.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:07):
And some have been great, some have been terrible. But Will & Harper was our most recent.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):
Oh, such a cool tradition. Okay, we'll keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:21):
Two, and one is I'm going to talk my own book, but I still love it. The first one is Aura Frames. These are digital picture frames. They're amazing. The UX for them is incredible, the quality of it, they're pieces of artwork. So grandparents, in-laws, parents, we have multiple in our house, just love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):
Just to clarify, it's a frame that has picked digital photos and you can give it to your mom and show photos of your kid wherever they live. Is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:25:55):
And the combination of the ease of the software and the quality of the imagery is better than anything I've tried, and I've tried a bunch of them. A-U-R-A Frames, and this is not an Enjoy The Work company. This is just one I'm a giant fan of.

(01:26:08):
The second one is an Enjoy The Work company called Augie Studio. A-U-G-I-E Studio. This is Canva for video. It can turn anyone with no engineering skills whatsoever, no code video creation, with full editing tools. So suddenly you can create branded high fidelity, high quality commercial video in minutes, with no effort. It's amazing. It was built by two media tech co-founders that were building this thing pre-ChatGPT, and it's just growing like this, and it's super fun, and the guys are great. So A-U-G-I-E Studio.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):
Sounds amazing. Augie Studio, I could use that. That sounds awesome. Two more questions. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work on in life?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:27:04):
The first one, and the one that I probably most commonly refer to, is that there is only one life. The quick backstory, and I know it's a lightning round, but I'm guilty of these stories. I went for a walk with a girlfriend of mine a bunch of years ago. And we did this once a month and we would always have a pretty typical ritual of giving each other life updates to begin the walk. And so I started the conversation with, "So there's the family update and then there's my work life and then there's my social life." She's like, "No, no, no, no, no, stop. That's all bullshit. It's one life. Stop assuming that there are these pretend walls between them or among them." I've lived that ever since.

(01:27:42):
So I try and show up. That phrase lets me show up the same way, no matter my setting. If you and I were having a beer or a meal, or if I'm sitting with one of my co-founders or clients, it doesn't matter, I show up the same way everywhere. Part of the way I enjoy the work is by having a real friendship, a real intimacy with everyone at Enjoy The Work, and including our clients as well, I want that level of conversation. I don't want the sterile stuff over here with my work environment versus my personal versus my family. It's just one version of me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:15):
And the phrase is, it's just one life.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:17):
Just one life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):
It's just one life. Final question. So you ran a casino at one point, I believe, and it was like a Harrah's Casino, is that right?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:28):
My first career was in the casino business.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):
Okay.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:31):
But before I go on, what's the question?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:32):
The question is just is there a fun story, or experience, or lesson from that time in your life that might be fun to share? Maybe a mob involvement, or cheating, or something? I imagine that's a unique life experience.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:28:48):
I'll tell one of my favorite family stories then briefly. But yes, my family goes back in casino gambling in one form or another, several generations. My great-grandmother ran a illicit poker game. My grandfather ran numbers out of a gas station. My father's been in the casino industry since Atlantic City in the 70s. My sister is a prominent gaming attorney, and I worked in the industry for a dozen years, so this is my family. And Lenny, I didn't know any of this was weird until I was in my mid 20s.

(01:29:18):
I turned 21, and I'm old, yes, I'm going to just hide the year. I'm kidding. Anyway, I turned 21 and we take a family trip to Las Vegas because that was normal for us. My father was doing a lot of work out there, so he got us hotel rooms, etc. I'd never been there before, and I was newly 21 and so my parents said, "You have $300 to gamble with. We're going to be here for five days." This is a vacation. My grandparents are coming in. My uncle and aunt were coming in, and they're encouraging me, "This is all up to you, but try not to lose it all on night number one," which was good advice to give me. I was 21 and I was pretty much a schmuck at the time. But also, part of my experience being there was to interview for a summer internship. I was a college going to be junior.

(01:30:06):
So we go and I immediately go sit at some table and start playing some games. And I turn $300 into a few thousand dollars in the very first evening. And that was exciting and it was crazy and it was wild, et cetera. On the third night, which happens to everyone who goes to Vegas for too long, we're all delirious because all of us are staying up all night and being silly and being stupid. And my parents ask me, by the way, this is pre-cell phones, they ask me, "Hey, can you stay awake? Your uncle and aunt are going to arrive late tonight. They'll call the room. You can come down and just greet them and say hello?" Sure. So I get the phone call like 11: 30 at night. Go on downstairs, they're here. I go downstairs in the casino floor. We're staying at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's since been renamed, but I go downstairs and I can't find them anywhere. I think, okay, well I have cash in my pocket and I'm now awake so I might as well gamble.

(01:30:53):
Shortly thereafter, Lenny, I have an experience that happens one in 369,000 occurrences, and I win $35,421.92. For the trip I ended up winning $40,000 that I turned $300 to, and I was just 21 years old, which has left me with one of my mantras that I've had for the rest of my life, which some people roll their eyes at, but that is gambling does pay.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:20):
I love that you remember the exact amount. What games did you end up playing that helped you win so much money?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:27):
The primary game that I played was Caribbean Stud Poker, where there's no skill of any kind. You get five cards, the dealer gets five cards, whoever wins wins, and if you have particularly unusual hands you get odds on the hand. And I got dealt 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of spades in five cards.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:44):
I thought you'd say slots or something. I love that you're just sitting there playing poker and went from $300 to $40,000.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:31:51):
It's not even real poker.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:53):
That was a great story. I'm glad I went there. Jonathan, this was incredible. I think we've helped a lot of founders through this conversation. Two final questions. Where can folks find you guys? Who would be a good fit? What should people know about Enjoy the Work? And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:32:10):
Love that. So let me unpack those three. The first one is enjoythework.com, or just find me on LinkedIn. I'm not hard to find. Send us a note.

(01:32:22):
Who should ping us is very simple. If you're a founder out there, or a CEO out there, and you know in your heart that there's some gap between how you're running the business and how the company's going, and how it could be going, and how you could be running the business, if there's some gap there, we're here to help. Now our expertise, as we talked about in this call, is company building. So if you just have an idea on a napkin or you have a science experiment that you're not sure, we're useless, that's not us. But if you have some breadcrumbs worth following, like the business is starting to work, you're a series A into B and beyond, and you know that there's better, you can see it, that's where we help. Send us a note. Love to chat.

(01:33:06):
How can listeners be useful to us? So we are ferocious readers. All we try and do is study how do the best startups do X? From tiny things, like how do they run all hands meetings or off sites to the big meta topics of what is going to repeatable go-to-market even mean? Or what is financial planning in a way that's useful? Or how do you set goals that won't make you roll your eyes? We consistently learn from the ecosystem of podcasters and authors and journalists, like, go look at this material. So if your listeners have a favorite X on whatever topic in running a startup, send them my way. All we love to do is read and chew on that stuff.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:54):
Awesome. And the best way to send that is either through Enjoy the Work or LinkedIn.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:33:58):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):
Awesome. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.

Jonathan Lowenhar (01:34:02):
Lenny, this was so damn fun. Thanks for listening to my crazy casino stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:07):
I want to hear more, but we got to go. Bye everyone.

# Competing with giants: An inside look at how The Browser Company builds product | Josh Miller (CEO)

## Transcript

Josh Miller (00:00:00):
We want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details. For other people, it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering headcount. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you get it. You give them a very exciting, ambitious product and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Josh Miller. Josh is the CEO and co-founder of a company called The Browser Company, which makes a product called Arc, which has quickly become my default web browser. I fell in love with this product as soon as I started using it and wanted to get a glimpse into how Josh and his team approached the craft of product. There's this cohort of companies like the Browser Company, [inaudible 00:01:09], a few others that are just laser focused on building the best possible user experience, almost above all else. And I wanted to spend some time exploring this trend with Josh. We cover how he thinks about prioritization, team building, storytelling, company values, metrics, shipping, building in public so much more.

(00:01:28):
Josh is such an earnest, genuine and humble human, and it was such a pleasure getting to learn from him. And, just to be clear, I'm not an investor in the Browser Company and I barely knew anything about the company before I chatted with Josh. So, I'm just a fan. And as a special surprise, Arc is normally invite only. But if you're listening to this now, check the show notes for a special link that'll get you right in to use the browser, if you want to play with it yourself. With that, I bring you Josh Miller after a short word from our select sponsors.

Lenny (00:03:57):
Josh, welcome to the podcast.

Josh Miller (00:03:59):
Thank you so much for having me, Lenny.

Lenny (00:04:00):
It's absolutely my pleasure. You are the CEO and co-founder of The Browser Company, which builds a product called Arc. Can you just talk about what is The Browser Company? What is Arc? And then whatever you can share about just like the scale of Arc at this point. That'd be really interesting to hear.

Josh Miller (00:04:15):
Sure. I hope you don't mind me doing this. I'm curious, I hear that you may, may or may not use Arc? How would you describe Arc to somebody?

Lenny (00:04:25):
The simple explanation is it's just the best web browser that I've used. So, to me it's a browser. I know that you have a bigger vision than that, but that's the way I see it as a layperson who hasn't seen the full vision.

Josh Miller (00:04:38):
Awesome. I think we can go home now. That's great. That's awesome.

Lenny (00:04:39):
There we go.

Josh Miller (00:04:39):
No. To be totally honest with you and your listeners, we have a really hard time describing Arc, which is something I'm not proud of. But it is, objectively, a replacement for your default web browser. And people who try it seem to really love it, and most people seem to have a hard time using the internet in the old way. So, that may sound like I'm being coy, but we have work shopped many a one-liners and the words have escaped us so far. So, to be honest, it is on our to-do list to get sharper about that.

(00:05:15):
And then in terms of our scale, since we have a lot of product managers listening, I'll give you the PM answer to that question, which is, we really focus on one key metric as it relates to tracking our growth or how we are doing. We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.

(00:06:01):
But so it tracks retention. It tracks engagement because five days a week is no joke. There are very few apps or pieces of software you actively use five days a week. And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week.

Lenny (00:06:54):
I love that we're already talking about metrics and retention. This is off to a good start.

Josh Miller (00:06:57):
You got to know your audience. Lenny.

Lenny (00:06:59):
We're going to talk about just how public you're about everything. But would you be for sharing your retention actual numbers? The D5 and D7 you just mentioned?

Josh Miller (00:07:07):
Yes. With the asterisk that I didn't prepare for that. So, Rebecca correct me on Twitter after this, if this is wrong. So once again, we don't look at DAU retention. We don't look at weekly active-user retention. We really just look at D5 D7 retention. Depending on the cohort, that's somewhere between low to mid-30s and low 40s. So really, really fantastic. Again, not going to continue. If there is anyone on this call that is going to check this in a year, it will be lower I'm sure. But so far, we're really thrilled with it.

(00:07:37):
And most importantly, in the same way, we don't look at absolute gross growth number, we don't look at retention in this moment. We look at, is it improving cohort by cohort? And so, what I think I am most proud of is that, if you go back a year, by all means our retention curve, we were really proud of it. And I think one of the best in our category of software. But, what I'm really proud of is, 12 months later we've been inching it up and up and up, despite getting further away from the earliest most passionate adopters. So, our retention curve's going up and up a little bit, which is-

Lenny (00:08:11):
All right. All right. If you haven't shared that, that'd be cool to share on Twitter someday. I'm a retained user.

Josh Miller (00:08:15):
I'm going to wait and you can share this clip. We'll share this clip.

Lenny (00:08:18):
Okay. Okay. I love it. We're just ready. We got the marketing strategy coming together. So, I told you this ahead of the chat, but the reason I wanted to have you on this podcast, even though, as folks may know, and as I've told you, I try to actually avoid founders and CEOs on this podcast to give other folks a platform who aren't often invited on podcasts. But the reason I wanted to have you on is, I just feel like Arc is a remarkable product. It blew me away the first time I used it. I don't know if you saw it, I tweeted as soon as I signed up? I had to share how awesome it was. I was like-

Josh Miller (00:08:47):
Of course I saw it. It made my day.

Lenny (00:08:48):
Okay. Okay, great. And, also as an outside observer, it just feels like you're building remarkable culture and team that's really unique. And, so I just want to selfishly learn from how you think about product and team building and all the things that go into it. So yeah.

Josh Miller (00:09:03):
Thanks for saying that, Lenny. What a cool way to kick off an interview.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Absolutely. First question I have along those lines is, you mentioned at some point that your product building philosophy is a reaction to the traditional Silicon Valley way of building product. I'm curious to hear what led you down that road? Why did you feel like you had to react to it? And then how would you just describe your product building philosophy at The Browser Company?

Josh Miller (00:09:27):
I'll share this caveat once and never again in this interview. But I want anyone listening to know, I'm someone who doesn't believe there is a single right way to do things. So, what I'm sharing today is truly just what we have found works for us in this moment for what we are doing. But, I remember when I was earlier in my career, I'd listen to podcasts like this and take it as dogma, because there are these people that had done it and I respected what they'd built. So, if any of this sounds like "better than thou," it's not intended to. This is just what we found works for us and what we care about. [inaudible 00:09:59].

(00:09:58):
Okay. So early in my career started a company also with Hursh, my current co-founder and CTO. We were fortunate enough to have that company acquired or acqui-hired by Facebook and spent a number of years working at Facebook. And remarkable organization, probably the best executing I've ever seen at that period of time. And, by the way, I'd never been a PM before, so I'm not complimenting myself, I was just learning for the first time. But what struck me at Facebook in call it 2014, and I've seen through to this day, is Silicon Valley, at least the most modern version of Silicon Valley, has this obsession with graphs, and has this obsession with numbers and metrics.

(00:10:36):
I mean, you saw me in the previous answer, I'm talking about D5, D7. What's a D5, D7? And, it is an incredibly effective way to achieve certain outcomes, to focus on numbers, because it's very quantitative, it's objective. You can see the graph go up or go down, or stay flat depending on what you want. But what we've found is that optimizing for metrics leaves a lot on the table and it misses a lot. And so, what we do at The Browser Company is we talk about optimizing feelings. How do we want to make someone feel on the other end of our software? Do we want to make them feel joy? Do we want to make them feel fast? Do we want to make them feel organized? Do we want to make them feel focused? What is it the feeling we are trying to evoke in whatever we're doing on a specific project, or a specific feature, or a specific piece of storytelling content?

(00:11:31):
And I can imagine what's going through the heads of your listeners right now, which is probably a number of things. But among others, that sounds really damn romantic. If they're like, "Okay. You optimizing for feelings." But if you allow me, I would posit that actually this modern way of optimizing for numbers and graphs, especially for what we all do every day, which is make things and put in the world, is what's fairly odd. Because, if you just to yourself daydream about, what are your favorite products or product companies and brands, while it may sound cliche for me, Nike. Nike was one of the first companies that at a very deep level resonate with me as a child. Disney? Disney, same thing. Apple? Before I was a professional in an industry, these were the brands and the products that they made that really made me love something that was ostensibly a commercial product I could buy.

(00:12:29):
What do you think Walt Disney was optimizing for when he was crafting Disneyland? What do you think Phil Knight was thinking about when he made that first version of the Nike running shoe? What do you think Steve Jobs was imagining and daydreaming about when thinking about the iPhone or the Macintosh? By all means, numbers are a fantastic way to be honest with yourself about whether or not you are achieving what you aim to do. But at the moment of creation, at the stage as product people, wondering what should we do, and why, and how? We think it's much more important for us to think about the human, the person at the other end, and how we really want to make them feel.

(00:13:10):
I think one tangible example of that is when I was at Facebook, I joined in the midst of Snapchat's ascendancy. And, there was a lot of feelings about how are we doing, should we be worried? And the way that we would have that conversation would be, how many times per week do people share on Facebook? Do they post something? We even had an acronym OBPS. It's like seared into my memory. What is OBPS? And how is it trending over time? Well, I think we should have been asking, and what we at least would ask at The Browser Company and our way of product development is, "Do we think people feel closer to their friends and family?" Or something of that nature?

(00:13:52):
I think that's what Snapchat got so right. They weren't obsessing about something like, "How many people put an image into the composer and hit the plus button. And the number of times per week means success." They were thinking about something much more human and essential. And so, that is what we've [inaudible 00:14:07] The Browser Company. Don't optimize for metrics, don't optimize for graphs. Use that as a way to keep you honest, and use it as a tool in your toolkit. But fundamentally, none of us are here for that. We're there to make people feel something.

Lenny (00:14:19):
As you pointed out, I think a lot of the people are listening are like, "I love that. I wish I could do that. I want to optimize for feelings, but then I got to drive the business forward. I got goals to hit. I want to keep people accountable." I'm curious how you operationalize this approach? How do you actually implement this idea? I imagine you still have goals and metrics and you guys, you talked about retention and things like that.

Josh Miller (00:14:42):
Yeah. Obviously it's difficult to do that in the abstract for another company, and it may not work for every company and every product. But, for example, one of the reasons we found this to be so effective so far is, if you pick the right feeling, it typically tracks pretty closely with the metric you care about. So, for example, we don't have a growth team and we have no semblance of growth projects. However, in many of the new features that we put out into the world, we want people to feel surprise or joy or an emotion like that. Guess what? When people feel that way, they go, "Oh, my God, what was that?" And they start telling their friends and family about it, and they start dropping a screenshot in Slack, et cetera. So, there's one example on the consumer side. I've never built traditional enterprise software selling to CIOs, et cetera. But I can imagine maybe someone in the IT department of a large enterprise wants to feel smart, or wants to feel ahead of the curve or wants to feel secure and ease at what they're doing.

(00:15:54):
I think sometimes we just forget that whoever your buyer is, or whatever your business objective, at the end of the day we're a bunch of people in a bunch of rooms at the other side of these screens. And just thinking about that person, it could be a buyer, it could be a customer. But I think the truth is the answer to the question Lenny is, when I was earlier in my career, I was searching for the answers or the way to do things, the right, the wrong, the binary. I think anyone that's been doing this or anything for a while learns that it's all nuanced. It's a spectrum. It depends. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

(00:16:26):
But I think the true answer, Lenny, is just optimizing for metrics so purely is deeply flawed in my opinion. Optimizing for feelings so purely is flawed as well. And it depends on what you are doing, what the project is and a lot of other things. But I think the reason we come out so strongly is, I do think Silicon Valley has tended so far towards optimizing for graphs and metrics, that if we can reel it back in a little bit, at least as just one company, I think that will be good. But the truth is, it's both. We need to use all the tools we can get, but I think hopefully that's one way that people can operationalize.

Lenny (00:17:05):
I'm curious, just to poke out a little bit, how you actually implement that? So maybe as an example, you recently launched this Peek feature, where you mouse over, I think, a link and it opens up in a little browser that doesn't last. Do you put together a little spec of some sort of, "We're trying to create surprise, and maybe here's a metric we think about it." What's actual day-to-day operational approach to a new feature, in terms of feelings versus metrics?

Josh Miller (00:17:32):
Yeah. The truth is I don't think we've operationalized it as formally as we should one day. And we'll probably need to one day. The lucky thing is we are a very tight group of individuals that have now worked together for a long time. So not so formal as there's a PRD at the top of it, we list out the emotions. It's much more, with that project, get Ben in a room and whoever else is working on it and say, "All right. So here's what we're trying to do for people. Here's the problem we're trying to solve or the way we fit in their day. And in that moment people want to feel very light and airy."

(00:18:05):
So, for the Peek feature [inaudible 00:18:07] he's referencing the use cases. You're on Hacker News and you want to probably in pretty quick succession check out five to seven URLs. And you're not really sure which one you're going to spend time on, but you're going to open a bunch of stuff really quickly. And Peek allows you to effortlessly just peek into it, without leaving Hacker News and context switching to this whole new tab and going back and forth. So in that scenario, the conversation was how do we make it feel really airy and effortless to just whoop, pop it up, pop it back down, lightness, airiness, speed, agility. So again, it's not that we have a, "What is the number one feeling and the number two feeling?" It is much more conversational at this stage, but I am actually really excited. Hopefully we got the privilege one day to have such a large team that we have to figure out a way to do it. So, that's an example of how we think about it.

Lenny (00:18:57):
It's a good segue to a question I wanted to touch on. So, I asked Scott Belsky what I should ask you. He's a big fan of yours. I don't know if he's an investor? But he's just like, "I love Josh." And asked him, "What should I ask Josh?" And one of his questions was about, you guys ship very quickly. You're shipping meaningful features every Friday. And you also close the loop really well with customers when they come ask for something. You're like, "Hey, here. We did it." What is it that you do, and what can people learn from the way you all operate that allows you to ship quickly?

Josh Miller (00:19:26):
Well, first of all, thank you Scott, if you're listening. It's somewhat of an awkward question admittedly, because it's like someone complimenting you about your product. It's always impossible to really take and accept the compliment, because you see all the blemishes. Of course we see all these ways in which we don't ship fast enough and could be doing a better job listening and building with members. But, at risk of sounding a bit cliche, I really think we ship our values. So, we thought a lot about our values as a company. You can read about them online. And I think if you examine those values and then you look at your compliment or Scott's compliment, you can see [inaudible 00:20:05] one-to-one. So the first, and I really think the most important is, we hire people that show up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:11):
And, a lot of companies I think obsess over craft details. They'll be a value like, "We obsess over the details." What we say is, we want people that show up to our company with some fire in their belly, something that they are out to do. And for each person it's a little bit different. For some people it may be UI Craft details, for other people it may be achieving double the performance with a quarter of the engineering head count. Everyone has something, but they show up with this heartfelt intensity. And I think even relative to everything else, I'm going to say, that's it. If you have a team that has heartfelt intensity and is there for a purpose and something to prove, you give them a very exciting, ambitious prompt and get out of their way and they will do remarkable work. So, showing up with heartfelt intensity.

(00:20:54):
Our second value is assume you don't know. Assume you don't know. And the value "assume you don't know" is, even if you're a subject matter expert. We have someone in our company that literally built the first version of Chrome and ran it for 16 years. But he more than anyone embodies this beginner's mind of, "I have no idea how this should work or what will happen." And the follow up to that value is, "So we got to get going." It's like dropping in a new city. You just got to walk out the door of your Airbnb turn left and ... Maybe you'll turn right and then you'll hop on the subway, but you just got to get going and see what you find. And so, we have this attitude of, you're showing up with this heartfelt intensity. But you start by saying, "I've no idea what I'm doing. I have no idea what's going to happen." So we've just got to get going. And that biases in a default to action.

(00:21:44):
We have another value of, start by asking, "What could be?", which is pushing ourselves to be as aspirational, ambitious as possible. So the Peek feature that you mentioned, we just didn't want to solve the problem of context switching. We wanted to almost blur the line between native and web software, and make it feel like a sheet of paper. And really pushing ourselves to be as ambitious as we can be, which is the consequence of blowing back around and more deeply motivating the people working on it.

(00:22:13):
So, I mean, I could keep going. We have a value, "You're doing it for the crew when you got to swarm. When you got to swarm," and we have value of, "make them feel something." But I think what it all adds up to is, a team that has a lot of heart, has a lot of intrinsic motivation and a, "It's the first day of my career. I wonder what's going to happen?" attitude. And I think all of those things add up to a culture which is, "Let's get something out there. Let's see what happens."

Lenny (00:22:46):
How did you come up with these? What was the process to come up with company values? Because I know a lot of companies are like, "We should come up with these." How do you do that?

Josh Miller (00:22:54):
The secret is I hate corporate values. I've never resonated with them. And I'm fortunate, we're fortunate enough, to have a lot of really spectacular, experienced leaders in our corner. And I got hammered to the first year, two years on, "Josh, where are your values? How can your team operate without values?" And I always experienced them on the other end as almost corporate propaganda, these cliche fortune cookie, Panda Express-like, "You should care about the detail." It didn't resonate with me. And the thing that clicked was maybe a year and a half, two years into working, I just kept hearing the same things from the team. And I would do things like a year into someone joining, "How's it going? What's going well? What's not?" And I realized that there are some traits that define our team, extremely organically and naturally. No one told people what our values were.

(00:23:51):
Again, because I was this naive, ignorant 31-year-old being like, "Values are a corporate, late-stage capitalism creation," and just very, very hardheaded. And it was really special two years in, hearing from the team why they love The Browser Company, why they think we're doing ... Just the passion there. And then we challenged ourselves to what became a value. Well, if something about the five one-liners on the corporate webpage feels off, start by asking what could be in dream a little bit. And what I realized was, all of the statements people would say about what they loved about The Browser Company, what they thought defined the way we work, they reminded me of how I like to take road trips. I'm a big traveler. I'm a big fan of dropping in somewhere new and just exploring. And so we just had this "Aha!" Moment. Let's, instead of having a corporate landing page with five value titles and subtitles, let's write a manual for how to take a road trip.

(00:24:54):
So we wrote an essay called "Notes on Road Trips" that use this semi-biographical, but mostly fictional, story about a person and their father taking a road trip when they're a teenager, to tell the story of how we do things at The Browser Company. And share these values, but in a way that hopefully won't feel so propagandary and feel a little more, you're reading an essay. So I say that, again, not to say there's anything wrong with traditional values. I'm actually sure I'm going to get an earful for a lot of people that coach me and give me advice that I sounded too indignant on this podcast. But I'm pretty proud of that story because it was a great example of assuming you don't know. We were sure that corporate values were not for us. And then very organically without trying it turned out, "Wait! They run through this company in a pretty profound way. We should put some words around it, because it's happening whether or not we like it, or say it is or not."

Lenny (00:25:49):
That's awesome. I have the page here and it's quite beautiful. And, pulling to it in the show notes just very briefly and tactically, did you just sit down and start writing this thing and then people gave you feedback? How long did this process take? Just for folks that maybe you want to go down this road?

Josh Miller (00:26:03):
Yeah. Warning downside of this process that it takes a lot longer than we thought it would, because we put so much heart into it. So, what it started with was again, in my natural one-year, check-in type conversation, starting to notice these patterns. And then we actually very comprehensively were like, "Okay. Let's sit down and interview everyone at The Browser Company. But no survey. One by one, talking to people, asking questions. And then we pulled out those words. So, actually what's really cool about these values, if my memory serves me, I believe every single one, with the exception of maybe a word or two, was something that someone on our team said. So we interviewed the entire team and then these are meant to be a mirror. The putting it in road trip essay form? That took a long time. That that was a lot of ... Yeah. I don't recommend the way that we did that, but-

Lenny (00:27:02):
How long is long?

Josh Miller (00:27:03):
Probably three months.

Lenny (00:27:06):
Oh. That does not sound that long. Okay.

Josh Miller (00:27:07):
Yeah. Maybe this goes back to Scott's comment that maybe our bar to how quickly we should ship stuff including values is, it's like I don't know. But, yeah. It felt like a long time. And this was not just me. Just for anyone listening, this was not CEO in a corner writing a missive. This was a team effort. There's a woman Abby on our team that did so much work on this project. The words themselves came from our team. So, it has my name I think somewhere on that webpage, but by no means was this me writing this essay in a corner with the fireplace on, or anything like that.

Lenny (00:27:40):
Okay. Awesome. That was really helpful. As you also saw, I asked on Twitter what to ask you, and I got a ton of questions. People have a lot of questions for how y'all do stuff. The most common question turned out was from Ched Khan who had the most likes of all the questions that people asked you. And it was around hiring, that basically you've been able to convince some of the most amazing people in the world to join The Browser Company. Like you just mentioned, you hired the guy that built Chrome, basically, to work on Arc now. What is it that you do that convinces amazing people to join? Because everyone wants to learn from you and copy you, and do that themselves.

Josh Miller (00:28:15):
Thank you for that question and for all the legs. I will admit, this is also a fairly awkward one to ask. I actually just came from an interview with a candidate and they asked me a fairly similar question. And I said, "You know what? You should go ask the people that work here. It's not me. I don't know why they ultimately join." But what I will tell you is, the intentionality, which is another secret, sharing a lot of secrets. This one will probably get me in trouble. I don't care about web browsers. I've never cared about web browsers. I never wanted to build a web browser. If you had told me a decade ago that I'd be working on a desktop first web browser at 32, "I'd say what in my career went horribly wrong?" The origin story of this company was Hursch, who I met when I was 20. We started a company together. Lots of mistakes, a lot of successes, a lot of growing pains and figured out who we are. And a decade later we were still friends, we went to each other's weddings.

(00:29:10):
We'd worked in all these different industries and different-stage companies and we just realized, "You know what? There are a lot of ideas that get us really excited. There are a lot of shapes and sizes." But as we were nostalgic for looking back on the decade prior, it was groups of people and moments in time with those people that were our best memories. And so, what Hursch and I decided, long before the company started was, we want to build a company, but we want to build a company where we feel like we can hire whoever we want. And I don't mean whoever we want in terms of who would dare say no. But we want to work on something where the greatest minds in our industry and adjacent would want to work on that prompt in a hypothetical sense. And then build an organization, build a team where we can work in the way that, after a decade of trying on a bunch of hats and ways of doing things and metrics this and [inaudible 00:30:04], we could do what was right for us.

(00:30:06):
And so, where we went to with a new web browser, let alone a web browser as a new form of computing, which is our true aspiration, to build an internet here. You can look up the internet computer YouTube video on our Browser Company YouTube page. But our ambition's even higher than a web browser. The intention of that is, we just want to go hire our favorite people that we know and don't know and build a team that, we'll never get bored working with this crew, because of how incredible they are and how humble they are. And so, when you think about it like that, I as the CEO as notionally the head of product, I view our product as our team. And I know a lot of companies say that. I actually think they probably all mean it. I don't think anyone's being disingenuous, but we really meet it. It is the genesis of this company.

(00:30:55):
It is not a new web browser. It is, let's build the dream team, our dream team. And let's build a way of working that is really fun for us and really speaks to our values. And let's go find people that resonate with that. And that trickles down to everything we do, whether it's our policy about this or the way we do that. I'll give you one example. Our goal of interviews is to convince people not to join The Browser Company. If I have an interview with someone, I don't pitch them and say, "What do you want to ask me? Anything you want? I'll be super honest, most people shouldn't want to work here." So I think it all starts with us viewing our product as the company, as the team, not Arc itself. And then, I think being self-aware, that that's how I think that's how we think.

(00:31:43):
But again, flying back things that I've heard, we have been fortunate. We've hired a lot of really remarkable people, especially on paper and especially off. I mean, all around. I'll just give a couple examples to share one thing that I've heard. A few recent hires, we hired someone named Darren who, as I mentioned, he co-created the first prototype of Chrome and then ran it for 16 years. I think hundreds if not thousands of people reported to him. He joined the Browser Company as an IC. We just hired a woman named Tara. She was on the original Paper by 53 team, one of my most inspiring products at the beginning of my career. Most recently she was actually, I believe, Senior SVP of product at Vimeo and a senior director of engineering. She joined our engineering team as an IC. We just hired someone named Peter Vidani. When I was 20 building consumer social software, he was the coolest, most impressive person. He was the first designer at Tumblr. Ran the design team at Tumblr for seven years and the most recently was SVP of design at Slack. Joined the team as an IC designer.

(00:32:48):
And though that sounds like I'm bragging, the thing that was really interesting and perplexing to us was, these are people that have made a lot of money, that have had really fancy titles, that have worked on transformative projects. Why are they joining this team? And I think something that people show up to The Browser Company with is, in addition to heartfelt intensity, this aspiration that their work at The Browser Company will come to define their careers. And that's coming from people that have done really remarkable things, by all accounts. And I think more than anything, we've realized that, in order for people like that to join and to show up with that, there are a number of things you have to promise and provide them, that make folks like that gravitate with the intention of doing their work of their career, ranging from an incredible and ambitious aspiration, really empowerment to act on the prompts that they're given on behalf of the team in the way that they see fit, and truly trusting and empowering them.

(00:33:54):
A very kind culture. I think if you've been doing this for a decade plus, your intolerance for bullshit is very, very low. And so, by no means do I think we're perfect. I don't think everyone shows up The Browser Company saying, "If I'm not on the equivalent of the early iPhone team, I'm going to be bummed." But I think generally speaking, Hursh and I, and everyone that was on the early team showed up with this aspiration of making The Browser Company the product. And I think that's carried forward to this tumbleweed of people saying, "[inaudible 00:34:23]. That's where I'm going to finally do the equivalent of building the iPhone." And we all know we probably won't, but there is that, "I want to give it one more shot. I want to go for it." And that just tumbleweeds, I think, at some point.

Lenny (00:34:37):
That tumbleweed is, I think a big part of it is, once you get amazing people, more amazing people want to join. So I think that's very much helpful. Something else this resonates a lot with is, just the mission of a company is such a powerful tool for pulling people in, the best people. I've seen that a lot with founders. If they have a meaningful mission, it's so much easier to hire, versus not. And clearly you're really good at sharing that vision and mission. And then you also have a really interesting mission and vision. I think there's also, you're just a charismatic founder and that helps a lot too. And you're a great storyteller.

Josh Miller (00:35:08):
Well, the other thing I want to add Lenny is, again putting myself in the listener, I imagine a lot of what I just said probably sounded a little bit ... Could come off, if you don't know me and you don't, as a little bombastic or a little again romantic. Very tactically, I'll give you something that was just who we are, but I think has helped contribute to this tumbleweed. From the very first person we hired, we celebrated them publicly. The fact that they joined. And in a very heartfelt way, telling you about them as a person and what they did. Long before we had anyone that anyone would've heard of before working at The Browser Company, just because it was earnest, we were really proud. Again, if you think of our original mandate as building the companies, the product, when our first designer joins, we want to tell everyone about it. That's a product launch. That is the product launch.

(00:35:57):
And then, whenever we ship something, we go out of our way to celebrate the people that worked on it publicly. I think there's a CEO-hero worship sometimes in Silicon Valley. I do very little at the company. Or sorry. I do very little as it relates to the thing people fall in love with Arc. I do a lot for The Browser Company, but I don't make Arc. I didn't make Peek. And again, that's just who we are, which is, "Alexandre. She killed me! Look at how cool this is!" because it's earnest and it's honest to who we are. And then I think it creates this reinforcing cycle of you're someone that's done something incredible, which is, "I'm going to be celebrated. They truly want me here. I'm going to be recognized for the work that I do.

(00:36:39):
It's not going to just accrue to this like CEO figurehead who everyone thinks is some genius visionary. And so again, by no means are we perfect. By no means do I think we get it right all the time. But, because it's such an authentic expression of who we are and what we were trying to do, I think we do little micro implementations like that, that ladder up to that principle I got so excited about but are as simple as someone tweets about some animation. They're like, "Woo! This was fun." Tag Sherry. Sherry made that, Sherry's incredible. And you don't see that that much in Silicon Valley. You see corporate blog posts and the CEOs more than anyone else. That's probably why you don't have CEOs on the podcast, because you don't want ... You know this Lenny. That is why that's your policy. You don't want to hear from the CEOs. They're not the ones building the product. You want to hear from the people actually doing it. That's why I love this podcast.

Lenny (00:37:26):
That's right. That's right. Thank you. I'd say just hearing everything you're saying, The Browser Company sounds like an incredible place to work. I could see why people want to go work. It's pretty simple. You touched on being public and sharing everything that's going on. And that's another area I wanted to spend a little time on. You guys are very transparent about what's going on and inside the company. You bring cameras into the board meetings. I watched a half-hour meeting you had with your head of design talking about a project that's behind scheduling. You're trying to figure out how do we get this out the door. You just share actual things you all are doing within the company, publicly. And I'm curious just, why did you start doing that? What have you seen as a good or bad that has come from that? Is there anything you've shared that maybe you regret like "Oh, maybe we shouldn't have put that out there." What's been your experience with that?

Josh Miller (00:38:17):
Why don't I start with the regret. It's not yet a regret, but the thing that I wonder ... Because this is very much ... I may have hopefully spoken with a lot of earnest passion to some of the questions before. This is one that I would really characterize as a prototype. We really have a prototype-driven culture. And this is one that I'd put high on the list of, "Maybe we'll regret this later." And specifically what I hope is that, I'm uncomfortable putting myself too central in our story. But, naturally, when you're doing storytelling publicly, there's a gravitational pull for the CEO and the founders to be at the center of that. And so, sometimes even this morning, we had our best-performing YouTube video ever. The first one that really broke out of people that already follow us. And it's a reaction video in classic YouTube form to MKBHD talking about our product for the first time.

(00:39:13):
And I honestly watched it right before this again, and I was like, "What the fuck am I doing? What are we doing? Why am I trying to become a YouTuber?" So, to be totally honest, I don't regret anything yet. But I wonder if we could take this too far? So if anyone's listening, if you see us starting to take this too far, especially as it relates to me, we want to hear about it, because that's keeping me up. But I do think the intentions are pure and earnest, which are ... And another thing that defines people that have joined The Browser Company, in addition to wanting to do the work that defines their careers, is I would characterize it as a little bit of hopelessness, maybe feeling jaded, questioning this industry that they've worked on or products that they've worked on and wanting to rediscover. But, at the end of the day, we are a group of idealists, of optimists, wanting to rediscover what we fell in love with when we were kids, whether it's the part of our craft or the potential of technology, the internet and software.

(00:40:19):
And, as part of that, I would view Arc and the Browser Company as an experiment in we can do it. Better is possible. And as we were thinking about better as possible, rediscovering what we love and believe in deep down and trying to express it in the world, one of it related to trust. I remember when I was a teenager using the internet for the first time and early on to college, just the hopefulness of what was possible, and the belief that these people building these tools, they were like heroes to me. Not just the leaders, but the teams, the companies, the brands. And somewhere along the way, I'm not blaming a single company, I'm not even saying that anyone did anything wrong, but culturally ... I was a sociology major. Culturally, we have lost trust in tech companies and in tech brands.

(00:41:10):
And so, building in public showing you our meetings, uncomfortably so, is an act in, "If we were them, why should they trust us? Why should anyone trust us?" We have your most sensitive personal data. We have your most sensitive professional data. Why should you trust us if we've had our trust broken again and again? And I think our hypothesis in this prototype, in this experiment is, we can have the best privacy policy in the world, but at the end of the day, again, it's just people behind the screen. And so, even if I think about ... I haven't done interviews like this, because I worry that if you don't know me, I come off the wrong way.

(00:41:51):
A lot of people tend to. I've noticed a lot of friends in my life that I know them behind the scenes, but the way that people perceive them publicly here don't know them. They interpret it the other way, because there's not that trust. And so our bet is that if you get to know us, Nash, Dina, me Hursch, and you really feel like you get to know us as person and all of our imperfections, we're average looking, we're average to all that stuff. Then when you see that we're asking for a permission, you might trust it is because we want to make you feel a certain way that's better. And if not ... I'll say someone tweeted something yesterday, who apparently we didn't earn the trust yet and they haven't gone to know us. And their interpretation of what we were doing was the worst possible interpretation you could [inaudible 00:42:40]. And, at first honestly, I felt a bit of anger, like, "Who was this person on a Thursday just saying we're doing X and Y?" And then I realized, "You know what? I'd have the same feeling because of the experiences I've had with technology in the past five to 10 years."

(00:42:53):
And so, the intention with these the building and public experiments are radical trust building. Not radical transparency, we can't share everything, but radical trust building. You get to know us as humans and I worry that we'll regret that, and that it could potentially turn into, "Oh, they're trying to be internet celebrities that they're so important, they should share everything because ... Thank you, them, for gracing us with their opinions." It's not the intention and it feels worth taking that risk. But that's the intentionality behind it.

Lenny (00:43:24):
That is a really interesting insight. It makes a lot of sense for a browser to find that so important, to build that trust.

Josh Miller (00:43:31):
I haven't done podcast interviews, I haven't done this. I really like you. I really like the feeling of your conversations, the intentions behind them, the warmth, even your intro music is a friendly jig. So, I mean, it's a great example, where I think it's one of the most wonderful things about the podcasting medium is I've had you in my ear for a year and the people on your show and you feel a sense of trust in you and your intentions here. And your intentions both in this interview, in terms of what you're trying to do for listeners. To some extent your show, and the warmth that you bring to it and the perception I have as a human being ... We've never met. We've maybe DM'd briefly, maybe five messages exchanged. But I feel like I know you and that makes me trust you. And so, in many ways this podcast, at a meta level's an inspiration for it.

Lenny (00:44:23):
I feel the same way in reverse. You made this point about being worried about being two front and center for your company. I have the same exact feeling. Even though my newsletter's called "Lenny's Newsletter," I only named it that because that was the default recommendation when I was signing up for Substack. I didn't want to be this, "I know it all. Come to me. Welcome to my know-it-all place." I really dislike that. And that's why I created this community that lives along the side, where people can help each other, because I'm not going to have all answers. And so, I've had to lead into that. "All right, people." They want a person to help them understand what's going on, learn about ... And in your videos you do a great job highlighting other people. I was watching your board meeting video and it's like, "Here's all team members coming along. Here they come. How are you doing?" So, anyway. All that to say, you're doing a great job finding the balance.

Josh Miller (00:45:14):
Oh, thank you. You as well.

Lenny (00:45:15):
I appreciate it. You talked about storytelling, and you mentioned that you have a whole bunch of odd teams at The Browser Company. One of them is a storytelling team. And that actually explains, I think, how you're so good at making these really amazing videos, because making great videos is hard. Can you just talk about some of these odd teams that you have, that probably other companies don't?

Josh Miller (00:45:34):
One of the other things that, hopefully, you're picking up in this interview, so far, is we are a very prototype-driven culture. It goes back to the "assume you don't know" ethos. We try a lot of experiments, and we try them related to product features related to how we work together, related to the stories we tell. So, this isn't a category of, "I'm not sure it's going to work, but we're trying it," and it seems to be working so far, at least for us. What Lenny's referencing is, we have a handful of teams. I'll pick two just as an examples. We have a membership team and we have a storytelling team. And though you probably recognize or are obviously familiar with those terms, those aren't historically startup orgs, or startup disciplines and teams. And let me tell you about the intention behind both.

(00:46:16):
Membership. Membership was, when I was at Facebook, the most impressive thing to me about how Facebook built product was their user research team. Shout out to Lowie and Jane. I don't know why you'd be listening to this podcast, but you deeply inspired me when we were at Facebook together. They had the most incredible team of user researchers. And it always felt odd to me. And this isn't Lowie and Jane's fault. Actually, in fact, they suffered from this. That user research almost felt like a service organization, relative to product engineering design. There'd be a PM. The PM would get assigned a researcher and the PM got to decide how to use the researcher, and ask them what to do and ask them questions. But seeing the potential for when you really get to know the people that you are building for, that you're serving, at a really deep way, it is extraordinary. How do you build product any other way?

(00:47:09):
And so, we took that to the extreme at The Browser Company, which we said, "Let's not think of it as customer support, customer service, customer success, user research. Those are just business terms. Those are just industry terms." At the end of the day, what we're saying is if there is a human being, from the moment they touch our software or our products for the first time, to, if they have it last, we need to have a deep, genuine, ongoing relationship with them.

(00:47:36):
And on day one, that may be air quote, "customer success." "How do I use this thing?" On day 37, that might be, "I have a bug. Do you mind helping me fix it?" And on day 58, that may be, "Hey, we're shipping the mobile app soon. What do you want from mobile? What do you want on your phone?" Other companies view that as different orgs and disciplines. We view that as, there are a bunch of people at the other end of this that we are serving from the moment they touch our product the first time. Let's own that relationship full stack and think about it holistically. And so that's the membership team.

(00:48:07):
On the storytelling side, very similar, different type of person. Again, we're a humanistic the company. So, the theme here is the people on the company, the people at the other end. So if the membership team takes people from the moment they touch our product for the first time to the last, the storytelling team is about people we don't have the privilege of serving yet. They don't use Arc, they don't know what Arc is. That could be an investor, air quote, "investor relations." That could be members of the press, air quote, "PR." That could be just people out in the world, air quote, "marketing" and one-day sales. But at the end of the day, it's telling our story to people. It's telling our story to people and thinking about that holistically in full stack.

(00:48:47):
So that's how we think about teams is, we start with first principles asking, what are we really trying to do here? And what is the most direct way to manifest that, even if it's not how other people do it? In practice, one of the benefits of that is I do think it leads to certain pieces of content. For example, that people go, "Oh, wow! I've never seen that before." But again, I think anyone's capable of this. I think we have an extraordinarily talented storytelling team and membership team, but I really think it's as simple as the intentionality of what is the team? What are their incentives? What are the disciplines on the team? Even hiring a video editor, for example, as a small company. But the video editor, not having make a TikTok account go viral. But think about it more holistically in terms of the people.

(00:49:33):
So, again, there's a lot that breaks down. There's a lot that's not going well about it. I have no idea how the scales, the 500 people ... Yeah. So this is not me saying this experiment is ultimately going to be a huge success, or right for everyone or even us at different times. But that was the intentionality of the membership team, the storytelling team and others. And even product management. We don't have PMs at the company. My title at Facebook was Product Manager. I love product management. But, we view it not as a team. We view it as a leader, a role on a project, on an effort.

(00:50:07):
And depending on the projects, different types of people should be a PM. So, we have a performance-related project going on where, of course, an infrastructure engineer should be that air quote, "PM." We have a product project, where actually I think someone from membership should be the PM, because ultimately, yes, we're building software product, but it is really about serving our members in a specific way, so we should have someone for membership be a PM. Again, as you can imagine, as is going through the heads of everyone listening, "That must break down in 18 ways?" Oh, it definitely does. And so I'm not promising one day it won't change. But again, continuous through the company is, assume you don't know. Start by asking what could be, and let's just try some things and see what happens.

Lenny (00:50:48):
Start with what could be. I love that value. This episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, this sheet tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you, instead of working for you? Why does it feel like such a chore to use? Well, Linear is different. It's incredibly fast, beautifully designed, and it comes with powerful workflows that streamline your entire product development process, from issue tracking all the way to managing product roadmaps. Linear's designed for the way modern software teams work. What users love about Linear are the powerful keyboard shortcuts, efficient GitHub integrations, cycles that actually create progress and built-in project updates that keep everyone in sync. In short, it just works. Linear is the default tool of choice among startups and it powers a wide range of large, established companies such as Versel Retool and Cash App. See for yourself why product teams describe using Linear as magical visit linear.app/lenny to try Linear for free with your team and get 25% off when you upgrade. That's linear.app/lenny.

(00:52:00):
So, I was going to ask you actually, you talked about why you don't have PMs. Do you think you'll hire PMs in the future, having a PM background? Do you think you'll get there or do you think you'll try to stick to this? People do the PM role, depending on the project?

Josh Miller (00:52:12):
Yeah. We've increasingly hiring people that at other companies may have a PM title. I'd say we have two to three right now, that could have a PM title at another company. I don't think we will have a pm organization, or a PM role, because again, we believe depending on ... If you unpack the verbs that a PM does, I think those are verbs that anyone that we hire could do. And it really depends on what is the project? And what are we trying to do? I think the thing that will be unwavering is we like to hire mutts. And I haven't yet figured out a term that comes off as more endearing, because it's meant to be very endearing, but ... For example, there's a woman in a company named Rebecca.

(00:52:58):
Rebecca was a data scientist we use at Cora. She got her PhD in MIT in I think behavioral psychology or something. I'm probably going to misquote that. But, got some crazy degree at MIT, and then was a software engineer at Stripe. And I'm talking about Rebecca through her resume. There's so much about Rebecca. She plays effectively a PM role right now. She is effectively PMing our effectively our multi-player team. But what was so awesome about meeting Rebecca is her and other people at this company have the mindset of, "I make things, and I will do what I need to do to make what I want to make. Whenever that verb is, whenever that discipline is." And that requires people that are multidisciplinary in practice and multidisciplinary in approach to their work. It's not that we don't hire PMs, but we want to hire people who have a multidisciplinary approach and view things as, "I like to make things. Tell me how I contribute to making it." And sometimes they may play the verbs of a PM and sometimes it may be something else.

Lenny (00:54:07):
This can be a really interesting story to follow. I've seen this journey a few times at different companies. What I find is a lot of times people that are good at other things like engineering or design, for a while, they're like, "Yep. We don't need PMs. I'll do the PM job." And then eventually they're like, "This sucks. I hate doing this stuff. I want to design. Leave me alone. I don't want to sit on a [inaudible 00:54:29] all day. I don't want to be in meetings." So eventually, it turns out, they're like, "Okay. Let's find someone to do this thing that loves it." And so that's one thing that happens.

(00:54:36):
The other thing I find is, I'm sure you've seen this, a lot of people are wary of PMs. They come in and they're like, "Here's what we're doing," and they're just adults process complexity. What I find is those are just bad PMs. If you have an awesome PM, everything just gets better. Everyone's happier, things move faster. So I think companies often get to that stage. And then also there's just career development stuff, eventually as you scale. It's like "What happened to my career path," and they're like, "All right. Well, we got to go on one road or another." It's hard to stay in this hybrid role. But I super respect the first principal's approach of let's just-

Josh Miller (00:55:08):
And, for what's worth, Lenny. I think you're almost, definitely right. And I think it will almost definitely happen with us. And again, this goes back to the "assume you don't know." The "assume you don't know," is try a prototype and then assume it's not going to work. So, even in my own experience, I remember getting to know Evan from Snapchat just enough to know how he talked about PMs at Snap. And it was, "We're never going to hire PMs at Snap. Everyone's a designer." And, I have no relationship with him anymore, but you can look, there are a lot of PMs at Snapchat.

(00:55:37):
So I know from my own experience with people that I respect from a product perspective that were indignant, they would never hire PMs, their organizations now have PMs. And that's probably for a really good reason. I would tell say also on our team, if any of our designers are listening, they'll tell you these, whatever you want to call it, "These verbs are taking up a lot of my time, and I do not have as much time to think and dream and design and do user research." And so, we're already feeling it breaking into our company.

(00:56:04):
I think the intentionality, whatever comes next, whatever it is, is leaders of the project should be picked for the projects, not because they're in a certain org at our company. And, if we ever hire people to do the PM role, we want them to think of themselves as people who make things and have lots of different disciplines and tools in their toolkit, not just the PM discipline. And, of course, even that could be wrong, and maybe in a year we cave. I got it totally wrong. We got it totally wrong. So, we'll see. But I would also, that that of all the things I shared on this podcast so far, this is probably the one I'll come crawling back to your podcast in a couple years, being, "Lenny, you were right. It all blew up!"

Lenny (00:56:47):
But it's a fun experiment and Snap is a good example. Stripes another, where they waited a long time to hire their first PMs. And I think it's because their designers or engineers were just incredibly good at that element. And it was also very design-forward or very edge-forward, so they didn't need as much PM skill initially.

Josh Miller (00:57:03):
If I had to predict, I would predict that if we found that we were missing this discipline as a team, I think we would evolve Rebecca's team, which is technically the data team, and do something closer to a technical PM or data plus [inaudible 00:57:19] Again, it's all live, but the thought has even crossed our minds recently, that we may be wrong, and what org might we create if we need folks that have more of a background of [inaudible 00:57:29] like this.

Lenny (00:57:30):
I'm excited for the video of this discussion that might happen. It's also interesting, your PM that you mentioned, Rebecca is very data oriented. And then, the initial discussion we had around focus on feelings and that sort of thing. So, that's cool that you have this really interesting balance of people that are very data focused and then this, "Okay. But let's not obsess with that. What are the feelings we're trying to create?"

Josh Miller (00:57:50):
Yeah. Because again, the point of optimizing for feelings is not hire people who make feelings. It's like Rebecca's title is Data Lead. She runs our data team. But, Rebecca's one of the most humanistic people I know. You meet her and you feel the warmth that you feel when you talk to you, and you ask her what she does outside of work. And so, it's not that data doesn't have a role. Actually I'd say, for better or worse, data is part of our practice. It's more about what's that top-level intentionality? What are we trying to do here? But, yeah. We have a lot of people that, data is either a noun they've had in their resume or it's been a part of their practice a lot in the past.

Lenny (00:58:29):
Awesome. One very tactical question with the storytelling team makes me think about Airbnb's video team. A lot of people are joking internally for years and years that the videos Airbnb put out in the early days accounts for half their market cap, because they're so good. And you're just like, "Oh, my God, I want to go on an Airbnb." They just make you feel so much and they're soul made. So, what is the makeup of your storytelling team? Because I imagine some companies maybe listening, like maybe we should do something like this on our team.

Josh Miller (00:58:57):
We have a three-person storytelling team. It's run by a woman named Nash. There is a gentleman named Ellis, who is a ... Background, started as a reporter at The Verge. Maybe there was a publication before that. But I met him when he was a reporter at The Verge covering social media. And then he ran marketing strategy for Snapchat for seven years. And then we have a person named Josh Lee, who I actually met as an intern. He was an intern at Facebook as a designer, that an intern for me at the White House when I worked at the White House, and then decided that he was over product design and over design, and totally just jumped and be like, "I'm going to be a filmmaker," and has been making really fascinating indie films for a few years now. And he's our video editor on the team.

(00:59:44):
And it's so interesting. Nash's background, she had a brief stint at NBC. But again, you get to know her and she writes poems after hours and her dream is to write a fictional book. I mean, anyone that knows Nash, especially [inaudible 01:00:00] is just a force. A force. And the three of them, what's so interesting about them, which also relates to our design team ... One of the things I also found at Facebook is there was a tendency toward homogeneity. As you know, there's a stereotype of a Facebook PM for example, or a Google PM, the contrast between them and the way they work. And one of the things we also have purposely done on the storytelling team and otherwise, let's hire radically different archetypes. Ellis cannot be more different than Nash. Nash cannot be more different than Josh. There's some shared values, there's some shared beliefs, but they're very different.

(01:00:35):
Ditto on the design team. Our design team? They are all over the place in terms of who they are, what they've done, their sensibilities, their aspirations. And whether it's the storytelling team or the design team, that can be hard sometimes, just to be honest. It's a lot easier to say, "Hey, we're the Acme Co storytelling team, we're Acme Co design team. We hire designers like this and storytellers that." We hire people all over the place. We have an extremely diverse team, but in all senses of the word. But again, the no PM thing, it's not without flaws. I can see why a lot of large companies over time tend are like, "It's the Facebook way or no way," or "You're not good for here."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah. It's actually I think, exact makeup of Airbnb video team. I forget what they were called. They didn't have a cool name, the storytelling team I think. But it was a videographer, an editor and then their producer, basically.

Josh Miller (01:01:26):
Yeah. I mean, I remember going to Airbnb's offices early in my career and seeing the storyboards lining the walls and just being like, "I want to work here." So, I'm actually not familiar with the ... I mean, I'm familiar with Airbnb's videos and brand marketing, fucking fantastic, excuse my language. But, yeah. I remember just walking around that office being like, "Oh, my goodness! Are they making a movie or something? I want to [inaudible 01:01:53] here."

Lenny (01:01:54):
Funny you say that. And for folks that want to find that, we'll link to it in show notes. But if you Google "Snow White Airbnb," you'll actually see these storyboards. They basically hired a Pixar storyboard artist to draw out key frames of the journey of a host and a guest. And that became a central element of the strategy of, let's make each of these moments as amazing as possible. And it was based on the movie Snow White. You can read about it.

Josh Miller (01:02:15):
For what it's worth, this is a great moment to share. All of the beliefs that I've shared here on behalf of our team, these aren't things that we just originally came up with. They're moments like when I went to Airbnb's office early in my career and saw these Snow White storyboards lining the walls. That had an impact on me. Even the idea that you would think in terms of that moment, you could actually see the lineage to, well, how do you want that person to feel when they open that door for the first time? So, I think it's just a great moment to shout out that we've accumulated a lot of doses of inspiration, like that day at Airbnb, that trickle down to us talking about optimizing for feelings. But that didn't come in a vacuum. That's our expression of what we've seen in the industry. This is building on the backs of so many people and companies that we've been fortunate to see.

Lenny (01:03:03):
And now the trickling is happening from your lessons and experience and your unique approach.

Josh Miller (01:03:07):
I hope. There's a documentary that I highly recommend called General Magic. And it's one of the best pieces of media I've seen related to technology industry. And it's really interesting. I think there are two types of people to just be very ... There are people that watch that and view it as, "Wow! What a missed opportunity," or almost like a sad story. And I view it as, "If only we could be so lucky to assemble a group of people like that." And the thing about that documentary, for anyone that hasn't listened to it is, essentially was the iPhone before the iPhone, with the most legendary group of technologists working there. And it totally failed, completely failed by all traditional business definitions.

(01:03:50):
But, what stuck with me from the documentary, how proud and nostalgic and passionate those individuals were in reminiscing about their time there. And then, what they all went on to create. And the fact that even today on this podcast, I'm sitting here talking about General Magic. So, I mean, to your point of hopefully Browser Company will have ripple effects. That to me is the ultimate goal, for me personally, at a very emotional level. If we could only be so lucky. That, to me, seems like success in many ways.

Lenny (01:04:24):
Yeah. What's cool is you're getting a lot of footage that will be very useful for a future documentary on the history of The Browser Company.

Josh Miller (01:04:30):
[inaudible 01:04:30] I didn't think about it like that, for better or worse.

Lenny (01:04:32):
One last thought, I was going to mention it in terms of the storytelling movie-making elements of Airbnb. Fun fact, there was a period where product managers were actually called producers, because one of the founders was like, "We don't want to manage product, we want to produce beautiful experiences," like a movie producer. And so that was a year and a half maybe of Airbnb's history, where product managers were producers. The problem is, we got a lot of job applicants from Emmy-winning producers and they're like, "oh, I want to work at Airbnb."

Josh Miller (01:05:01):
I know this podcast is about very tactical advice. So, one tactical piece of advice I'll give is, whether or not you like the idea of the storytelling team or something else, a byproduct of some of these experiments that we've found works really well is when you give something a new name, it sheds a lot of preconceived notions of what the thing should be. We found that even with product. So if you say you're building a browser history feature, then the benefit is everyone knows what you're talking about. And the downside is, everyone knows what you're talking about. And you show up with these preconceived notions of what it has to be. And so, if you go back again to revalue ask what could be ... In many ways the point of calling the team, the storytelling team or the membership team, or not having PMs as an organization ... All of this stuff isn't meant to be novelty for novelty's sake. It's meant to almost be a rhetorical tactic, to make people think truly first principles about what are we trying to do here?

(01:06:00):
And again, if at the end, producers are called PMs, that's fine. But I assume when it was called a producer, a much more intentionality was given to you communicating and talking and discussing, what does a producer do? What's their relationship with design? Because no one knew what the heck a producer was. And so, ultimately, that may have been failure in other ways. But that's one of the things we found tactically to be really helpful is, whether it's a product feature or a team, or whatever, give it a made up name just to really get to the root of what you're trying to do there. Or not borrow too much from wherever you worked before, whatever you've seen, popular media or whatever.

Lenny (01:06:36):
I love that. And it's very undo ... Like, you've got to undo it. It was-

Josh Miller (01:06:41):
Exactly.

Lenny (01:06:42):
It's a two-way door. And I like just the vision, the value you have of just prototyping things and whatever. It didn't work. Let's go back to what everyone else is doing. You mentioned great product and there was something I definitely wanted to chat a bit about, which is just, there's this group of companies who are just focused on, "Let's just build the most amazing product experience." And I feel like The Browser Company is at the forefront in a lot of this. But it's like you guys, Linear, Raycast is this product, Cron. There's probably a few more and I'd love to actually hear if there's others that I'm not thinking about. That are just obsessed with the user experience and less focused on drive metrics, drive revenue.

(01:07:24):
And I'm curious, just where do you think this goes? What's your take on this trend? Why isn't every company thinking this way? Or is this just like, "We don't know if this is a good idea in the end?" So what's your take on this cohort of just like, "We're just going to build the best possible product and hope it all works out,"?

Josh Miller (01:07:41):
Yeah. Well, I'll say first, I love those products, or many of those products you mentioned. There's some I haven't really used. But, for example, our company runs on Linear, and has run on Linear since day one. So, I'm a big fan of that. So, the way that we think about it is ... So, I actually spent two years at a venture capital firm as an investor, called Thrive Capital. They've invested in Slack and GitHub and a lot of really transformative companies. But I was an investor there. I was a venture capitalist. It even feels weird to say that. And I learned a lot. A lot. A lot. A lot from that experience. It has made me, I think, a better CEO and a better product leader. And one of the things I learned is different ideas, product ideas, business ideas, company ideas come with different attributes and things that will matter to their success.

(01:08:34):
And so, when thinking about starting The Browser Company and picking this category of software, Hursch and I were incredibly intentional about what that would mean for what would need to matter for our company. And so, if you think about the web browser category, traditionally ... I'm not saying forward facing, I'm not saying it is what we are doing. But, if you were to look backwards and take The Browser Company out of it, and look at the web browser category, you'd notice a few things. The first is, it's actually one of the most consumer pieces of software out there. People forget that. That's the opportunity to us. If you ask someone in the street, "What's your web browser? What do you think?" They either won't know or they won't care, "[inaudible 01:09:15]. I don't know."

(01:09:16):
But what pieces of software do your parents, do your little nieces and nephews and you use? What's at the center of that Venn diagram? Your parents hopefully don't use TikTok and Instagram, or probably don't. Your nieces and nephews, I hope don't have a reason for email at the tender age of 16, or a calendar. And a web browser's one of the few things in the middle. So it's an incredibly universal piece of software consumer, unlike very few other things outside of a smartphone and messaging, and maybe video calling in 2023 and a web browser. So, it's very consumer, very universal.

(01:09:52):
The second attribute is, it's a commodity. I'm not saying that Arc is a commodity or we want it to be, but objectively web browsers are interchangeable. They all do the same thing. Increasingly, they're literally just carbon copies of the exact same code chromium, with little tweaks, little tweaks around the edges. So, they're all the same. It's a commodity market. And they're unbelievably lucrative. Browsers print cash. There is a reason why they're owned primarily by Google, Apple and Microsoft. They're incredibly high margin, they're incredibly lucrative. Low marginal costs. The cost of revenue is incredibly low, et cetera, et cetera.

(01:10:30):
So we have a product that everyone in the world uses, where they're all identical, essentially, interchangeable commodities. And if you can get people to use it, you're going to print money. So, the attributes of that business and that product category mean, you have to win on how much do people love your product and feel an emotional connection to it, and choose your brand, your product over the other, almost not rationally, but emotionally. And so, if you tie that back to everything I've said before, bingo! That is what we want to work on. That's what we want. We want to create emotional connection with people. We're creating that emotional connection with as many people as possible and delighting them with surprises and animations, is the way you win. It's not romantic, it is practical. In many ways it's capitalistic. This is how we win this market if you want to think about it that way.

(01:11:30):
So, the reason I hesitate to answer your question directly is, I don't think that applies to every category of software. And to be totally honest, I don't know enough about the ticketing space or the calendaring space or the whatever other space to know, honestly, off the cuff, if that approach is good for those industries. As a human being, at the other end, I'm really grateful that they picked some reason to do it, whether or not it is part of their business strategy or not. It's a really wonderful trend as a human at the other end that cares about feelings. But I would say, we actually think about it not as a, "We're focusing on the user experience over revenue or growth." We, in fact, picked a category of software we're focusing on brand and user experience is how you get growth and revenue.

(01:12:14):
And, because we knew that this is who we are, and if we were building cybersecurity software that you sell to government agencies, they are not going to give a shit about rounded edges, or what color the button is, or how surprised you feel with every member update. So, we didn't build cybersecurity software to sell to the government. So, I hope that more people build things at the craft bar of something like Linear, but that's how we think about it, is less of a "this versus that," and more "could we pick something we're going to work on, where that's how you win."

Lenny (01:12:48):
I think that's a really powerful insight, that for consumer software especially, and for commoditized consumer software especially, experience is a differentiator. You need to give people a reason to even try it, and then end up sticking with it when there's awesome alternatives. And so, just an obsession with the experience is a really smart strategy. If you get that right, people use it and continue to use it and you win.

Josh Miller (01:13:13):
I've seen this with a lot of ... And COVID is, I'm sure everyone listening, has a lot of the remote-work collaboration tools. A lot of them obsess, to their credit, over really interesting design details and product feature concepts that were imaginative and brought people together in new ways. And then the latency of the video of the audio audio was horrible, because they relied on some third-party API that was significantly worse than Zoom. And so, that's a great example where in that market, that category software, you better nail latency. I think a great example of this ... One of my favorite products these days, but past years is Tuple. It's ostensibly a paired programming tool that just lives in your menu bar. I'm not paired program with anyone. It is the fastest way to talk to someone at your company. And they have an unbelievably simple user experience.

(01:14:00):
The designer, based in Lyon, France, is incredible. It's a beautifully designed product. And it is the best audio quality I have ever experienced in a communication tool. Better than Zoom. So, that exact same product with all their craft details, sand latency, not going to do it. But also Tuple wouldn't have beat a lot of the other competitors for me if it wasn't unbelievably beautiful and easy and simple to use as well. So again, I think it's like, what are the attributes you need to win and picking a market that the ones that you want to excel at and work on, are key to that.

Lenny (01:14:34):
And also how much better you need to be. Like, if there's a 20% better than Chrome product, people are just going, "That's fine. I don't need to learn something new and everyone's using something else. I'm just going to have all these problems." So, you got to be significantly better. And that's a high bar for consumer products. Final question I wanted to touch on. You talked about the big vision for Arc and The Browser Company. And you mentioned this idea of the internet computer. And this is another question Scott Belsky suggested. By the way, Scott is the CPO of Adobe and just an awesome product-thinker person. And he just wanted to make sure that we touch on this, because I think there's a big idea here that maybe people don't realize. So, if you could just give us a brief overview of, what is just the actual vision and plan for The Browser Company and Arc, long term as a final question?

Josh Miller (01:15:19):
Yeah. So, we call it The Browser Company of New York almost as a misdirection, because as you know from the intro, we view Arc as a replacement for your default web browser, but we're hoping it will be much more. And so, to start at the highest level and bring it down to reality, one of the things that I've done many times in my career already is underestimate pretty foundational changes in how we use technology. I've appreciated them but underestimated them. Great example is mobile. I think me and Hursh's first company would've been much more successful if we really appreciated the tidal wave that was mobile. And I think one of those macro trends we're underestimating right now is the shift to cloud computing. The shift to the internet, which may sound weird because every big public company mentions Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services. You hear about cloud, cloud, cloud and cloud. But again, that's this business term.

(01:16:13):
What I mean by the shift to cloud computing is, everything in our technology, in our computing lives is moving to the internet. It has been moving, but it's going to move even more. And what I mean by that is, your applications are almost all today web-based, internet-based applications. And they will all be soon. There's very, very few pieces of truly local-only software or even local-first software left. All of our files are moving to the internet, if they're not all already there. So if you really think about your files today, and again you ignore the word "files," the stuff you need for work in your personal life. They're not sitting on your desktop, they're all URLs. It may be an air quote "PDF," but that PDF is probably out on Dropbox somewhere and you're accessing it as a URL.

(01:17:03):
Your photos may seem like they're on your iPhone. They're not on your iPhone, they're on some iCloud server somewhere. When you get a new iPhone, they'll be right there. The manifestation of that actually is, if you smash your device that you're listening to this on right now, whether it's a phone or computer, other than being sad that you lost the resale value and there's a chore of replacing it and a cost of replacing it, you would not lose any of your stuff. So, imagine in five years our entire computing lives are not on our devices, on our computers, on our phones. They're out there somewhere. They're out in the internet, they're out in the cloud, which begs the question ... I remember when I was 10 and I got my first computer. It was a see-through iMac. And I wonder ... My son is two. When he's 10, what will his computer be?

(01:17:52):
And I mean computer not in the technical ... Again, going back to words and the words that we use. I don't mean computer in the literal sense of my MacBook Air, but computer in the human sense of, what you need from your computer, your stuff, your applications and tools that people ... Where is that going to be? Where is his computer going to be? I think it's obvious at this point that we're going to have airflow computers everywhere. We already do. My car has CarPlay, my TV is a computer, my laptop is a computer. I think that's going to be even more true in five years, where hardware is commoditizing. And it will commoditize even more. They're becoming empty shells that don't have anything on it. They're just vessels. They're just interfaces to viewing our real computer, which is out there on the internet somewhere. And so, our view is that what we are building at The Browser Company is an internet computer, is a air quote "computer," where the move to the internet and move to the cloud accelerates and continues the tsunami as much as we think it will.

(01:18:57):
And the way we represent that is, we say we want to be to the web browser, what the iPhone was to the cell phone. Yes. The iPhone replaced your cell phone, but it really was something much more. And so, we want Arc to be the iPhone for the internet, and that yes, it replaces your default browser. But whether or not we call it the internet computer or something else, it really is that interface, this new type of computer. If you play that one step forward, then what we're building today is, we're building our equivalent of multi-touch gestures and the first party-notes app. But, on any new computer, any computer or computing device, the developer platform itself is much more interesting and lucrative and world changing than the first-party computer itself. And so, we have no doubt that in the next decade, if we're successful, if we still exist, Arc as a development platform is going to be much more central to what we're doing, building on top of these internet computers, ours and others than anything else.

(01:20:00):
So to bring that down from reality. If you think about it, the internet, the web, is really the best development platform out there in many ways. It is accessible on every single device. It doesn't matter who makes it or the shape and size. It is free to access for individuals. You don't need money to access it. It's free for developers. You don't have to pay a license to use it. There's no 30% tax on what you make. And it's democratic. The best frameworks can win. And so, in many ways, if you were to say, "Hey, in this future we want to see, what is the platform that we should be developing on top of, what has the best attributes?" The web has that. And that's why you're seeing today. Why do you think Figma is in the web browser?

(01:20:41):
Why do you think Figma's blog post was "Meet us in the Web Browser"? Because as the development platform, developers cross platform in one click. There's no tax. Everyone should want to and wants to make for the web. The challenge, though, is there's an experience gap. Native software feels better for whatever reason. And the problem is the people that control our interfaces to this development platform that is the web, that is the internet, have incentives to keep it from being as good as local software, from truly native, immersive software. Apple? They don't want you making web apps or applications for the web. They want you making them for the Mac and the iPhone so they can taxi you when you do it through the app store. And also surprisingly, Google doesn't want you making stuff, more native and immersive for the air quote "Web," because they want it to be indexed by their search engine.

(01:21:37):
So, there's a reason that the Chrome extension platform is one of the most underutilized opportunities. They view it as a loss leader. They built chrome extensions just so they could have parity with Firefox. They don't want you making extensions, because you have some immersive extension experience that's not something that you could index in Google. And that's taking away from doing searches. And so, I think we look at this and say, everything is heading to the internet, which means we need interfaces to the internet that are truly more robust than a browser, that are more of a computer. And if we do that, then the most interesting opportunity on top of that is actually the things other people were built on top of this development platform. And if you look at this development platform, which exists today, the worldwide web, the open internet, what is missing is an interface and a set of capabilities and APIs to make web-based experiences as immersive and rich and powerful as native experiences, which require that interface to the internet to provide those.

(01:22:34):
And our interfacers to the internet today are the web browser companies. They have perverse business model incentives as big public companies that have lost the soul of the founders, that they don't want to do that. They don't want to do that. So it doesn't mean we're going to do it. And in fact one of them may win. And I actually think that this is something [inaudible 01:22:51]. We're trying to sell anyone in our vision. We feel fully confident there are going to be many types of internet computers and Arc may or may not be one of them. But we feel very confident that that is the future and the development platform on top of the web and the internet, and these new interfaces will be the most exciting opportunity.

Lenny (01:23:09):
My next question was going to be how do you make money with a browser, which people get for free, really well? And now it makes a lot more sense where y'all are going. And so, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Josh Miller (01:23:26):
Ready.

Lenny (01:23:27):
Okay. So, ready? What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Josh Miller (01:23:34):
Harold and the Purple Crayon, Seeing Is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees, which is a book about Robert Irwin. That's my number one PM book. So, if you're asking from the perspective of the disciplines of people listening, that book is absolutely fantastic. And then God Saved Texas by Lawrence Wright, who's one of my favorite authors, who if you're interested in road trips, politics, food, culture. So, three very different types of books.

Lenny (01:23:58):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Josh Miller (01:24:01):
The first TV show episode I've cried from in recent memories, episode three of The Last of Us. I thought I was watching a zombie violence thing and I just was sitting there bawling. So that one. And then I've been re-watching all of the Adam Curtis documentaries on YouTube. I'm a huge Adam Curtis fan.

Lenny (01:24:20):
I have not heard of Adam Curtis. I will have to go check that out.

Josh Miller (01:24:23):
Hyper-normalization is my favorite. And I would view his work as less non-fictional documentaries and more video art.

Lenny (01:24:32):
There's been a meme of everyone saying White Lotus is the show to watch. And I feel like it's about to transition to Last of Us. And so we will see how that goes.

Josh Miller (01:24:40):
Can I get it first? Was I the first guest to say it?

Lenny (01:24:43):
I think you might be actually. I forget, but I think you might be.

Josh Miller (01:24:45):
All right. Well, I'll say episode three, specifically.

Lenny (01:24:47):
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. People love that one. But every episode's awesome. Next question. Favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?

Josh Miller (01:24:56):
What would you like to ask me? That seems like a non-answer, but my interviews at Browser Company are all, "Ask me anything," and I find what people ask, and how they follow up, is as revealing about who they are and what they care about than anything I could ask them.

Lenny (01:25:12):
What is it that you look for in an answer that tells you, okay, this is a good candidate?

Josh Miller (01:25:17):
Authenticity, probably more than anything else. Do they really believe what they're saying?

Lenny (01:25:21):
Awesome. What are some SASS products that your company uses and loves, other than ... ? I don't know if you consider our SASS, but probably not. So, yeah.

Josh Miller (01:25:29):
I want to plug Tuple. I think I'm going to put everything on Tuple, relative to ... We run on Notion, we love Notion, we love Linear. But I'd say the closet hit that I just cannot believe is not a hundred times larger company is Tuple. It is ostensibly a pair programming tool, but don't go in with that mindset. Go in with, "I need to talk to a colleague right now," or "a couple of colleagues right now, to do some work together," and it is absolutely fantastic.

Lenny (01:25:58):
I love it. I love these products I've never heard of that are super cool. We will link to that. Next question. What's something relatively minor you've changed in how you build product, that has had a significant impact in your team's ability to ship and execute?

Josh Miller (01:26:11):
This past January, a couple months ago, we have started removing me from a lot of the product development process, which seems to be really healthy. So, that has been the big shift this year.

Lenny (01:26:22):
That's a big transition. I went through that at Airbnb and it's great. It's great for everyone. Final question. Best pro-tip for using Arc, that people may not be aware of?

Josh Miller (01:26:32):
Try your best to not think of it as a browser. And have a beginner's mind about how it works and how you might use the internet.

Lenny (01:26:40):
Whoa! Big idea.

Josh Miller (01:26:42):
Yeah. Big takeaway from this conversation, we got to get much better at describing what the heck we built. And why it's good for you. So, I'm not proud of my first or last answer, but it is what it is.

Lenny (01:26:54):
And, actually, I mentioned this in the intro and if you listen to this already, you probably heard it already, but we're going to link ... In the show notes, we'll have a link to actually get into Arc, because right now it's wait-listed and we have this link that will get you straight into Arc. And so go check it out. Josh, you've shown up with heartfelt intensity. I feel like I want to go apply for a job at The Browser Company now. But you're not hiring product managers, so I'm not going to do that. Just kidding. Thank you so much for being here, for being so genuine and insightful and warm. And thank you.

Josh Miller (01:27:29):
Thank you so much, Lenny. I really enjoyed this.

## Transcript

Julian Shapiro (00:00):
Why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness. Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold.

Lenny (00:37):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders, and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies today. My guest is Julian Shapiro. I actually spend a bunch of time introducing the wondrous Julian at the beginning of the episode. Instead, let me just share some of the things that we talk about. We get into a framework he calls product-led acquisition, which is work that has come out of his working with thousands of companies, helping to figure out their growth strategies.

Lenny (01:10):
We get into ways to increase your product's retention. Then we talk a lot about writing, the importance of novelty in your writing, how to choose a topic when you plan to write, and then a framework that Julian calls the Creativity Faucet. Julian is such a fascinating human, and I'm really excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Julian Shapiro. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.

John Cutler (01:37):
Hey, Lenny. Excited to be here.

Lenny (01:39):
John, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics. But now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?

John Cutler (01:50):
Well, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform that, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. The big aha was seeing how many customers we're using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.

Lenny (02:11):
Supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?

John Cutler (02:15):
Yeah. Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.

Lenny (02:24):
Absolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to Amplitude.com to get started. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (02:38):
At least 40%.

Lenny (02:40):
How many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?

Ashley (02:42):
Well? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. If your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock- full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (03:03):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (03:17):
Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (03:34):

He's an amazing writer, marketer and growth mind, investor, community builder, podcaster, tweeter. He's also an expert on building muscle. He's maybe most known for being the founder of Demand Curve, a YC startup that trains people on growth and marketing. Prior to that, he was a part-time columnist at TechCrunch. He was also VP of marketing at Webflow, which I had no idea about.

Lenny (04:09):
He also created a JavaScript web animation engine that is used by Uber and WhatsApp and Samsung and thousands of companies. Currently he is a full-time investor with his own fund and as a partner at Hyper. He's also one of the most hilarious and generous humans that I know. With that, Julian, welcome to the podcast.

Julian Shapiro (04:28):
This is the greatest honor of my life. Thank you.

Lenny (04:31):
Wow!

Julian Shapiro (04:32):
I'm crying from that intro. Very nice of you.

Lenny (04:35):
That's the idea. This is the greatest honor of my life. We match.

Julian Shapiro (04:40):
Excellent. We'll cancel each other out and we'll see how interesting this is.

Lenny (04:43):
That's right. There's a lot of hype. I know you have something like 250,000 Twitter followers. You're very good at Twitter, but I've noticed that you've only tweeted three times this past year. What is going on there?

Julian Shapiro (04:58):
There's a few things in parallel. One is a lot of people are writing threads and I found this to be very cringe. They're like these fortune cookie threads like here's 21 ways to rework your startup or something. I found them all cringe. What they actually do when you write that stuff is they attract people who think that's valuable information, and then they cause people who you actually want to follow you to unfollow you. I remember just seeing people unfollow me early days of threads when no one was doing them and I was experimenting. They were pissing off people that I actually cared to have dialogue with.

Julian Shapiro (05:36):
I kind of lost the momentum and enthusiasm for writing that sort of stuff. And now I'm only writing anything when it's basically a reflection or a condensed version of a blog post that I happen to be writing from my website. I know it's high quality. I know it's original. I know it's thoughtful. It's not for the click bait. That was part of it. The other thing is that it's kind of like too... Here's a mental model for thinking about the quality of your followers. You have people who follow you for the quality of your brain, and you have people who follow you for sort of you being a glorified curator. If they're following you for being a curator, they're sort of what I call labor followers.

Julian Shapiro (06:16):
They're following you for the work that you're doing, where you're finding cool, funny memes. You're posting cool, funny jokes. You're doing these fortune cookie threads. In contrast, if they're following you for your mind, which is category one, it means they're following you for the original thoughts and insights and takes that you have on the world. Someone like Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, is doing original takes. He's not trying to write threads for the sake of gaining followers. He's trying to write interesting novel ideas. When he does that, he strengthens the affinity that his followers have for him and his mind, because like, "Wow! That was an original interesting take."

Julian Shapiro (06:49):
They're following you for your mind, not for the labor you're doing, putting together a virtual Buzzfeed to count on Twitter. When people follow you for your mind, when they're mind followers, not labor followers, higher affinity means more loyalty, means they pay closer attention to what you're saying. And if you actually try to get them to do something with you, you have an event offline, there's something you're selling, there's a cause you care about, they're way more likely to indulge.

Julian Shapiro (07:12):
Whereas if they're following you for your labor, you're interchangeable with all these other meme accounts and there's no real affinity for you as the individual. I just care more about the quality of the follower than I do the volume.

Lenny (07:23):
I love that. That's such a good reminder, not to just focus on follower, follower, follower. I'm curious if someone... You have a lot of followers at this point and it's just so valuable to have Twitter followers. I've learned for me, anytime I have a question about anything, I just ask and I get so many amazing answers from people. There's this power to having a large following. I'm curious while we're on this topic, if you're just starting out on Twitter, do you have any advice for someone that's just thinking about building their following?

Julian Shapiro (07:50):
I mean, generally speaking, threads, despite everything I've said, are the primary way to get followers. There's a reason why people do threads as opposed to single tweets is because when people get exposure to a thread, they're basically getting exposure to the length of thoughts equivalent to you having sent a newsletter edition or a blog post in many cases. The more exposure, the more surface area you have, the more you give people of your brain in a single tweet, the more they're able to confirm that what you're sharing is actually a consistency from you.

Julian Shapiro (08:21):
Whereas if you just tweet one clever thing, they're like, "Oh, that's probably just a drop in the bucket. Who knows if that person can consistently generate clever stuff?" But in a long thread where it's 30 tweets and they're all good, they're like, "Whoa! This person is a machine. If I follow them reliably, I'll get more great stuff." It reaffirms to readers they should follow you, which is why threads trigger more follows. Basically you do want to do threads, frankly, and that's the backbone of it. Threads with very clickbaity opening tweets kind of how it works.

Julian Shapiro (08:52):
You can also port followers over from other places like your website and newsletter, just to start giving yourself an initial sample audience through which the threads can actually take fire pretty much.

Lenny (09:02):
Awesome. I wasn't expecting to go into Twitter as strategy, but this is interesting because you're really good at it. As you've said, your stuff is actually very thoughtful. It's not just a thirsty Twitter thread trying to find followers and retweets. Thanks for sharing that.

Julian Shapiro (09:18):
Well, it sort of started that way, because me and a few other friends of mine, I felt like we were the first people doing threads at scale. And then when we realized what it turned into, that's when we just stopped.

Lenny (09:28):
I love that. I know what you mean about these cringy Twitter threads. Anyway, what I want to do is instead of asking a bunch of random questions is to focus on five big topics and kind of go deep on these topics. These are topics that are maybe most popular of the stuff that you've put out across your handbooks and writing and courses and things like that and also things that I've found to be most interesting. Does that sound good?

Julian Shapiro (09:51):
Yeah, I would love to.

Lenny (09:53):
Cool. First, a little context, you write these super in depth handbooks on a bunch of different topics on growth and writing and muscle building and things like that. First of all, could you just explain what these handbooks are and why you create them?

Julian Shapiro (10:05):
They're forcing functions for me to hold myself accountable and to be thorough when learning something for my own benefit. That's all they are. Basically if I want to go learn growth or writing well or some other topic, I will go ahead and do a ton of research, read everything I can get my hands on, do a ton of experimentation to try to build a set of novel insights that you couldn't find from other people's research hopefully, and then the next stage is try to make it as concise and actionable as possible so that I can reference it for my own selfish benefit. Here's my guidebook for myself on writing better blog posts, for example.

Julian Shapiro (10:40):
And then by the time I've done that work, what usually happens is its only like, I'm going to make up a number here, an extra 30 hours of work to make it palatable and digestible for the public. If I've done all this work privately, why not make it accessible publicly? At that point, it winds up being acquisition fodder for essentially building an audience and distributing my thoughts further. That's why I do that. But the thing that I pride myself on with them is by no means are they thoroughly unique, but in every one there's a lot of original stuff folks on average have never heard of before.

Julian Shapiro (11:14):
And that's what I'm proud of, is coming up with those insights between the lines that make that thing, whatever the topic is, much more approachable. I've succeeded, in my view, if I've made something that people often mistakenly think of as overwhelmingly complex very simple for them to follow. I think that's where the dopamine hit comes from for them.

Lenny (11:34):
Well, my experience, you definitely hit the nail in my head with the handbooks you put out. It's an interesting middle ground between a newsletter and a book. It's cool to just have a digital way of doing that, of just kind of consolidating a bunch of ideas and going really in depth, but not having to write a book. Well, speaking of the contract there.

Julian Shapiro (11:51):
You have a very large newsletter that goes very in depth. That arguably is a more valuable asset than my handbooks for someone building an audience, because the newsletter has this built-in form of retention recurrence, where they get pinged in their inbox when you have new content, and then it becomes a referable thing and people refer each other and then they sign up for the newsletter. I do love the emphasis on longform via newsletter, but the reason I do it on the web is, and we'll talk about the trade-offs in a second, is it's much more digestible and referencable.

Julian Shapiro (12:24):
No one's going to go refer to the epic guide in their email inbox that's very hard to navigate for building muscle or something. One, it's a UX decision. Two, I get the SEO traffic, which you don't. And then three, it's basically a living asset that I can keep updating over time. It's not stuck in someone's inbox and getting printed out. One of the things that might separate me from other writers, at least many other writers online, is I'm spending as many hours going back and rewriting old blog posts and handbooks as I am writing ones.

Julian Shapiro (12:55):
If you come back to anything I've written over the course of a year or year and a half, it'll be updated, because I consider everything I write to be evergreen. I avoid writing things that I feel like are a drop in the pan, just like talking about a trend or something, something very newsy. I avoid that altogether and I'm just interested in writing stuff that'll be relevant for a long time.

Lenny (13:13):
I didn't know that. That is very cool. I love that you do that. You should make that clear. That's so interesting that this is not stale. Last updated, last week. I don't know if you already do that.

Julian Shapiro (13:21):
Yeah, no, I actually don't and I probably should. People have complained to me that I haven't, so maybe I will one day.

Lenny (13:25):
All right. We got a good idea out of this, if nothing else.

Julian Shapiro (13:28):
There you go.

Lenny (13:28):
Okay. The first idea that I want to chat about is something that you call product-led acquisition. I believe it's the most popular page in any of your handbooks. It comes from you working with thousands of companies to help them figure out their growth strategies through Demand Curve. I'm curious to hear what this concept is and how people can use it to help their products grow.

Julian Shapiro (13:51):
Product-led acquisition to your audience will be more commonly known as product-led growth, but I think product-led growth is a bit of a misnomer. It's often used, as you know, to basically refer to SaaS companies who are using self-serve sales funnels where a salesperson isn't required, right? Bypassing sales and allowing the product to grow itself. That's fine. But I think the term we really care about as growth marketers is product-led acquisition, meaning the use of the product grows the product. For example, if I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000.

Julian Shapiro (14:31):
By me trying to use PayPal in its everyday intention and me getting value out of it to settle a debt, I'm automatically enticing someone else, very strongly so, to also become a PayPal customer. That's product-led acquisition. There's a few different categories I've identified, and I think the reason why people like this part of this article I wrote is because it's, in my opinion, the absolute best way to grow any startup. If your startup can grow via product-led acquisition, not all can, maybe some are enterprise-base and all they're going to make work is sales, then it is by far the best way to grow because zero marginal cost to have users invite other users.

Julian Shapiro (15:12):
It's scalable. It creates network graphs typically and has compounding effects there in terms of both moats and the ability to acquire more customers quickly. Basically to the point I just mentioned is basically viral. The other interesting thing here is there are far fewer dependencies. Let's say your company primarily grows via content and SEO, where you're at the mercy of Google releasing an algorithmic update let's say twice a year, which occasionally will absolutely tank your traffic and most people know what I mean by that if they've experienced that. It's awful.

Julian Shapiro (15:41):
Or ff you're a paid acquisition-led company, as opposed to a content-led acquisition company, meaning you're running Facebook Ads, let's just stick a Facebook for now, Facebook and Instagram, you're also at the mercy of the volatility of CPMs and whatever weird updates Facebook introduces or whatever targeting options they suddenly remove. Your entire acquisition strategy is anchored on something that is completely out of your hands and very volatile. Product-led acquisition is like the better you craft your product and the incentive structures for existing users inviting other users, that's entirely in your control and the better you grow.

Julian Shapiro (16:19):
That's the quick context. Now, I'll go into some examples. We started with the example of... Actually one thing that came to mind that I love is Paul Graham, who we mentioned earlier, Paul Graham from YC, has this quote which is "don't start a startup where you need to go through someone else to get users." That always really resonated with me. Here are the categories of product-led acquisition that I've identified. Number one, like I mentioned, is users inviting other users to settle debts.

Julian Shapiro (16:51):
If I'm going to pay you money I owe you for splitting dinner on Venmo, or a business expense that I'm paying you, you're my vendor on PayPal, or anything that's allowing me to just pay you money I owe you and I have to use a product to do so, whoever is collecting the money from me is going to make an account on that product if necessary to claim their hard earned money. Almost guaranteed way for you to have user-led growth, product-led growth. Now, it doesn't have to be money. It can be settling a debt of like an NFT, for example.

Julian Shapiro (17:19):
Someone buys an NFT from you on OpenSea and the only way for them to receive their NFT, I'm just making this up right now, is to also have an OpenSea account or a wallet that's specific to that collection. Again, making this up. The point is if you're settling the debt of something you owe someone and they must make an account to capture the thing owed, they're going to sign up. That's category one. Category two is when you're inviting someone to join the product you're using to partake in a conversation that the otherwise cannot access. Why does Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, all these chat apps, Discord, grow so quickly?

Julian Shapiro (17:58):
Pretty obviously because if you and your little clique of friends are having your conversation in that app, then the person who's also in your real life friend group, but who hasn't yet installed the app has to install the app in order to have the conversation with you. Inviting people to critical, social, or business conversations in an app is the other way that you can nearly guarantee you'll grow very quickly from product-led acquisition. The business version of this is Slack. You sign up for Slack. You invite all your friends or all your coworkers. Then you even invite all your vendors via Slack Connect.

Julian Shapiro (18:34):
Slack Connect was a brilliant Slack feature where they're saying, "Hey, we're now going to encourage you to invite people who aren't using Slack who are outside of your work." I don't know how that's done for them as a feature, but in theory, it's a brilliant way to expand the surface area for inviting people via product-led acquisition. Just to recap where we are real quick, one of the ways of acquiring customers is to encourage existing users, to pay other people or to encourage them to come into your app to have conversation that's only happening on the app.

Julian Shapiro (19:04):
If I'm a product person and I'm road mapping my product, I will think, is there anything in my product conducive to either one of those two functionalities, settling debts, or can I introduce chat within my product? And if so, you might be cracking open an amazing channel. When I tell people about product-led acquisition, I'm usually doing it in the context of let's rethink your product feature roadmap to prioritize features that facilitate these things that can lead to explosive growth. I'll pause if there's anything you want to dive in there, but I have three more categories we could chat about if you want to, three more ways of doing PLA.

Lenny (19:44):
Yeah, absolutely. I just want to lob a question over there as you're going through these to maybe touch on this. Most founders would love to find a way to grow through virality and invites and all the things you're talking about. I find that it's often hard to lop onto something they're doing, if it's not a natural fit. As you're going through this, I'd love to know how often have you seen startups succeed adding something like this when their app is not a money exchange app or a chat app? I'm curious how often it works to add something like this when your app's kind of something else, if that makes sense?

Julian Shapiro (20:17):
Well, the real lesson is don't start a company if you have no idea how it's going to grow. Now, that's not categorically true for all startups. It's irrelevant for deep tech and biotech and climate tech and all that stuff, but for a lot of these people starting SaaS companies where they intend to grow very quickly among B2B customers or B2C. The real point of what I'm saying is if you have three ideas before you as a founder and one of them lends itself to product-led acquisition really beautifully, then lean in that direction perhaps if you think that growth is the key differentiator between them for what's going to lead to success.

Julian Shapiro (20:51):
It's like make life easier on yourself. Because if we're relying so heavily on SEO and content, which is extremely saturated, or paid acquisition, meaning ad channels which are extremely saturated, especially if you have low LTVs where we can't really tolerate the volatility of paid CAC or just the cost in general of those CACs, then we have to be thinking more strategically at the product level. It's less about tacking it on later, but sometimes this will work brilliantly if it's very organic. When we cover my next category, we'll actually see some examples of how you can pack it on more seamlessly.

Julian Shapiro (21:24):
But the other response to your question, which is a great question, is people mistake product-led acquisition for referral programs, which it is not. Because the referral programs are a tact on incentive trying to give people something to encourage them to invite because they otherwise are not inviting. Whereas PLA, as I've currently defined it, is through the natural use of the product, you get more value when you invite others. You settle your debt with the payment recipient. You get have a better conversation because now your friend Jack is part of the conversation. You don't have to incentivize them with anything artificial, with any rewards.

Julian Shapiro (22:00):
Referral programs generally are not exciting to me because you're usually trying to... Again, you're like self-selecting for folks who just want the reward very often. And then the people they invite might also just want the dual ended reward and they're not even here for the app really. And then they can bounce. And then they don't invite other people typicall.y. It doesn't have the same compounding sticky retentive nature of PLA. I'm not a fan of it. If you can make a work though, fantastic. Anyway, third category is what I call billboarding. Billboarding is this idea that the use of the product is inherently visible to people around you.

Julian Shapiro (22:40):
The product advertises itself. A few examples. Actually, where I got the term from is I was looking at these billboards above the highway in San Francisco, where I was seeing the company that actually hosts the billboards advertise their own logo on the billboard while also showing you whatever ad they were being paid to show. They were using their own surface area to advertise themselves. Another example is when you're seeing an ad network across the web, like Google banner ads perhaps, and it says they're brought to you by Google Ads, they're using their own surface area to advertise themselves.

Julian Shapiro (23:14):
That's billboarding. It's a brilliant free way to get a ton more exposure. There's a few ways to do billboarding. One is the classic example of Hotmail and iPhone. When you send an email via Hotmail, at the end, it pens a signature saying sent via Hotmail. Same thing, sent from my iPhone. Every single email sent from an iPhone device, unless you remove that signature, is a free billboard for Apple itself, which further furthers the brand awareness and gets more people buying.

Julian Shapiro (23:45):
For example, if you have a feature in your application where people are sending emails or communications to other users outside of the org, like it's an app for sending SMS messages or it's like a way to send invoices to your vendors, when you're facilitating that generated messaging, say brought to you by the name of your startup in the signature of it, really use your own surface area to increase your own awareness. That's billboarding in two different ways. The third way is the very obvious way of having something unmistakably recognizable out in the world.

Julian Shapiro (24:21):
If I drive a Tesla, if I wear Nike shoes, if I have Apple AirPods, all of these are immediately visible to everyone around me, which is why sometimes physical products can really explode because they're just free walking billboards all over the world. And then the sort of most topical hot example right now on Twitter is when you switch your Twitter profile to an NFT in a particular collection, you're billboarding for that NFT collection, right? Same phenomenon that occurred with the Bitcoin laser eyes.

Lenny (24:50):
And also for Twitter Blue, to be able to even do that.

Julian Shapiro (24:53):
Yes, exactly. Exactly right. Like Telegram right now, they released something like Twitter Blue. I forget, I don't know what it's called. But now when you're a Telegram premium paying user, it has a little star thing next to your name that everyone else sees. "Wait, what is that? Oh, that's Telegram Pro. Let me take a look at that." Last example, which is one of my favorites, is billboarding via the nature of your product being something people are compelled to share in order to use. If I have a Calendly account, I have to share my Calendly link with the world in order to create an event on my calendar.

Julian Shapiro (25:28):
If you're like me, you get a million Calendly links every week. That's the phenomenal form of billboarding, people are sharing it willingly. No wonder they've exploded. Same thing with Dropbox sharing file links and you're seeing the Dropbox URL, or GoFundMe, when people share the GoFundMe page. You get the gist. Billboarding costs you nothing, scales infinitely, can have compounding effects. And if your product lends itself to billboarding, it's just a phenomenal way to grow if possible. That's category three, I guess. We'll cover one last one, if you'd like me too, which is basically UGC, so user generated content.

Julian Shapiro (26:05):
Same sort of thing. Basically I hop on YouTube or TikTok or Insta or whatever. I make content. I share it with the world. In so sharing that content, the platforms brand themselves on the content. At the end of every TikTok video on Twitter that you've ever seen or Insta, at the end it'll say, "Here's the TikTok user's account." They're billboarding themselves into the content that users themselves are generating, and the users are incentivized to share that content off platform, which brings users to the platform, because users want to get customers wherever they can. They're going to cross-sell to their YouTube channel and so on.

Julian Shapiro (26:41):
If you have a marketplace like eBay or some marketplace for selling collectible shoes or something where you're encouraging users to create beautiful content of the items being sold, like these cool landing pages that show off the products, and they share it elsewhere, then that's an example of users making content they're sharing off platform that is useful for their own followers. Another example of UGC that people often overlook is Quora or Reddit or Stack Overflow or TripAdvisor, where you're encouraging users to create content in the form of conversation that then surface itself on Google and SEO.

Julian Shapiro (27:23):
Basically if you just encourage users to have conversations that are publicly indexed, that increases your surface area on Google for hitting more keywords and you get way more search traffic. Basically the question that this boils down to is to leverage UGC in your product, you ask yourself, do users use my product to make content in any way, shape, or form? If so, what type of content that they make should we encourage them to then share? And then how can we make the page that they use to share the content as appealing and as easily to consume as possible? And that's basically UGC. We'll pause there, but basically that's PLA in a nutshell.

Julian Shapiro (28:03):
The thing that all of these have in common is you're not spending a dollar. They scale super quickly. You're not reliant on, well, maybe to some extent with SEO, but you're not relying on third party volatility. It's a much healthier narrative for how you're going to grow and scale.

Lenny (28:17):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.

Lenny (28:57):
Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. I have many questions I'd love to ask, but I also want to make sure we get to the other topics.

Lenny (29:34):
We talked about acquisition, which we'll link to in the show notes, by the way, this whole post. The flip side you could say is retention. If you're a reader of my newsletter, you know how much time I spend thinking about retention and how important that is. I know that's a second topic that we wanted to chat about, because you've also helped a lot of companies think through their retention strategies and to help them retain more users. I'm curious to hear what you've found to be the best strategies for retaining users and increasing retention.

Julian Shapiro (30:01):
Yeah, sure. The way I think about retention, my favorite strategy is what I call building state. It's a concept I stole from video games, where basically the more you play any given game, the more state you're accruing. That might be your armor, your weapons, your character skins, and whatever. As a player of the game, the more state you build, the more you're compelled to stick around, because you don't want to lose everything you've worked so hard for. The more state you have, the more you can exploit that state to get more. The rich keep getting richer. The same mental models apply to let's say SaaS retention.

Julian Shapiro (30:38):
This is as old as time, or at least as old as modern capitalism. If you think of credit card rewards or frequent flyer programs, you spend money. You accrue points. You convert the points into rewards. Once users build momentum doing that, they're less likely to switch to a competitor. That's the age old example of building state. Software, it's unbelievably powerful. This building state concept is why mediocre companies like eBay or Craigslist remain completely unbeatable for decades. Even though the UX is bad, people don't like using them, they fail to innovate, no one topples them and it's because of state.

Julian Shapiro (31:16):
Let's walk through some examples. State, kind of like my PLA mega spiel, mega rant there, subdivides into a few categories, but I'll make this one shorter and less boring. The first subcategory of building state is when you're encouraging your users to accrue non-transferrable reputation, meaning they're doing stuff to build reputation on the platform and they cannot take that reputation to them off platform. They're stuck there to get the compounding advantage of that reputation. For example, let's say you've spent years getting 10,000 or more feedback ratings as an eBay seller.

Julian Shapiro (31:56):
You are not leaving eBay anytime soon, because that reputation's just too valuable. It's producing a huge boost in revenue because of the trust it engenders with buyers on eBay. It probably results in you ranking better in search results for an eBay query. Because you cannot move those 10,000 feedbacks to an eBay competitor, you're not incentivized to go use an eBay competitor. This type of stickiness, this non-transferrable reputation, basically applies to all marketplaces and directories. Same thing on Yelp. You as a restaurant build your reputation on Yelp. The momentum keeps you stuck there. You want to keep getting reviews and hone your reviews.

Julian Shapiro (32:32):
Airbnb with your properties, Etsy, for you as a seller, Alibaba, all of this stuff are examples of companies that are kind of old now, cannot be top old or haven't been yet. People are like, why? Well, because of this exact reason. This is why those companies pester you so much to leave reviews and provide feedback all the time. They want you to play into this game of in market reputation building. The second state building technique that a startup could adopt, and again, this is all under the guise of how do we maximize retention and build somewhat of a moat, for example, the second way you can do this is you encourage your users to accrue a non-transferable audience.

Julian Shapiro (33:14):
If I'm a big YouTuber and I've acquired a million subs, those subs can't be transferred anywhere else. I can't bring them to Twitter. In fact, YouTube doesn't even tell me their email, so I can't even bring them to a newsletter if I wanted to. The more subs you acquire on YouTube, the easier it is for you to go viral on YouTube. This is what I mean earlier by the rich keep getting richer. It's this momentum trap. It's very, very hard to convince any YouTuber to get off YouTube. If anything, they'll dabble with another network in parallel at best.

Julian Shapiro (33:43):
Basically if you have a startup where you're creating a marketplace or an audience graph, you want to encourage users to build a follower graph within that product that they can take advantage of by pushing their product or their content or their insights too. This is why Twitter... By the way, a big shout out to Substack, which actually allows customers to export emails off of Substack. Substack is not playing that same game, which is better for users and a very nice thing for the ecosystem. But this is why Twitch and Instagram and Twitter are just irreplaceable. I mean, not necessarily. Everything dies over time like Facebook, but they're just so darn hard to topple.

Julian Shapiro (34:26):
Let's maybe touch one more. I don't want to ramble so much about this. Well, this one's kind of similar. Basically if you spent a lot of time building a social graph in a product, like if I spent the last 10 years trying to remember the names of all my high school friends and elementary school friends and add them one at a time over the years to Facebook, or I've added all my colleagues for the last 20 years onto LinkedIn and I've built a social graph on these products where I've curated and found people, that's really sticky. You're building state in the form of taking time to expand the graph. The graph is a representative of the state, the work you've put in.

Julian Shapiro (35:04):
You don't want to lose those connections with people. That makes that product extra sticky. This is why social networks in general can be sticky. It's not just the fact that you have your audience there, it's that you've invested time. If Facebook doesn't allow you to export your graph out, then that makes it extra sticky as well, because you don't know how else to talk to old Jimmy from elementary other than Facebook. Anyway, there's actually many more of these examples of building state. I'm going to just stop with that. But the basic concept is what can you encourage users to do within your product that makes them more deeper entrenched in the product, and most apps just completely lack this.

Lenny (35:39):
I like that. It's a little bit like the concept of having skin in the game and just building more skin in the game with the product that you're using. One quick question, is there a company that you've seen do this, like add it on, and succeed and increased retention that you've worked with or out there? Just like is there a good example that comes to mind that added this piece?

Julian Shapiro (35:58):
Again, none of this is really under the context of telling people to add it on after they've decided what they're building. This is all in the DNA of the product you're choosing to build. I'm not sure. I haven't thought of those examples. I'm thinking more so in whose DNA, which company's DNA are they doing this brilliantly? For example, one form of state is... One I did not cover is when you're embedded infrastructure. If you're Twilio, Striper, AWS, it's really hard to move off or segment because it's so much work to redo your code and introduce all this risk to screwing up your code base. People have built patterns around how they work with your API.

Julian Shapiro (36:36):
A lot of modern API startups automatically capture the stickiness by virtue of being so deeply embedded into a product. Generally speaking, none of this is in the context of like, hey, add it on post hoc, pretty much.

Lenny (36:46):
Got it. I like that lens actually through a lot of these things you're talking about is maybe it's less like change your product to make this happen, and it's more idea selection. I know you're also an investor, and so it's a really good lens on how many of these things does this company have that I'm investing in.

Julian Shapiro (37:01):
Earlier I was mentioning why do I write handbooks, I wrote the handbook that PLA and state building come from to cement my diligence criteria for companies I believe might grow super fast and retain customers. You're exactly right. My investor's perspective is if you have a zero cost of acquisition mechanism for customer acquisition, such as PLA, and you can retain them through something like state building, but there are other ways to retain customers, then I lean in harder because I think you'll be more defensible as a company. Actually interesting little side note is you'll often hear retention and stickiness refer to as a moat, right?

Julian Shapiro (37:41):
But I find this term actually very misleading because very few companies have actual moats. To have a real moat, you're basically exploiting kleptocratic, meaning you're friends with the government and they're creating a literal barrier to entry for your competitors, or you have a scientific moat where you have an actual scientific breakthrough in the fusion energy space, plus protected by patents. Those are real moats. But the way most people use the word moat is wrong. In practice, your "moat" is just your mechanism for retaining users a little bit more than the average company.

Julian Shapiro (38:21):
I believe state building is one of the best ways to do exactly that. Really it just comes down to what are you doing to help users build state and get more value over time out of the product, not the same level of value over any time period.

Lenny (38:35):
Awesome. Shifting a little bit away from growth and into writing, which I know you've spent a lot of time writing about, very meta, and sharing on Twitter and all the ways, you have a handbook where you go into this concept of novelty and a framework for how to be novel and why that's important in writing. I'd love for you to talk about why novelty is important in writing and ideally share your framework for creating something novel that keeps people engaged in reading.

Julian Shapiro (39:03):
Sure. This actually goes back to your question about Twitter. What can one do to build an audience on Twitter? It often comes down to writing things that are novel. Novel is what powers click bait in most cases. The other way is via curiosity gap, where you raise a question you don't answer, but the other half is novelty is what gets people to click into a thread and read it. Novelty, I define, as new idea, so something I haven't heard of before, that's also significant, so it's not some trivial fact about Kim Kardashian, and it's something that I wouldn't have easily intuited on my own.

Julian Shapiro (39:44):
When you have those ingredients, it's new, it's significant, and you wouldn't have easily thought of it on your own, that's when you trigger that dopamine hit reaction, I'm not being scientifically accurate here, but you're going to get that dopamine hit like, "Whoa! That's super cool." The more you have readers pausing going, "Whoa! That was interesting," the more novel your writing is. My whole approach to writing is write something out, and then point out all the points of novelty. I do that by actually having 20 friends read something I've written and highlight the sentences that made them go, "Whoa."

Julian Shapiro (40:17):
And then I have this visualized map in a given blog post, where are the areas that people go, "That's really interesting," and then I can see all the white space between the interesting parts. I go in and I condense that white space. I chop it down so that the frequency of novelties as high as possible. This is how you get a blog post that just has this phenomenal momentum that gets the read to completion rate to be very high. The question is, what exactly does novelty look like? I've identified about five different categories for it, and this is the backbone of how I write in many cases.

Julian Shapiro (40:51):
The first category of novelty is what I call counterintuitive information. You tell people something and they go, "Oh wow. I never realized that the world worked that way," or different categories and you tell people counter-narrative information. That's where people respond, "Wow. That's not how I was told the world worked." Whereas counterintuitive novelty is, "That's not how I would've thought the world worked," counter-narrative novelty is, "That's not what I've been told. I've been lied to. Now you're telling me the truth." That also triggers a dopamine hit. Third category of novelty is just pure shock and awe like, "That's crazy. I would've never believed that's true."

Julian Shapiro (41:30):
For example, there's a volcano that's going to erupt the next 15 years that's going to swallow this whole island. Wow, that's shocking. Holy moly. Next category is what a lot of popular Twitter users do is what I call elegant articulation, where you're taking an idea... Naval does this, Naval on Twitter, the founder of AngelList. He'll say something that's a complicated rich thought and boil it down into a very concise sentence. And then the reader goes, "Wow, that's beautiful. I couldn't have said that any better myself."

Julian Shapiro (42:02):
That also triggers that dopamine reaction. There's a few more, but the point I want to get at here is all of these are formats for identifying the types of things you could say to get people to go, "Whoa." That's what I think of as novelty.

Lenny (42:17):
Something I've found to kind of identify something that I've written is going to be interesting is I just read it myself and I feel what I feel when I'm reading it the first time. Often I find that if I'm like, "Oh wow, this is really good and really exciting," I've learned to trust that feeling wherever that comes from. That's just like another way of knowing if your thing is interesting is like, are you excited about it? Are you interested in it as you're reading it? And that fades after you read it like 10 times and kind of edit and edit, but that's just a small tip I've learned, just kind of trust your own gut feeling when you're excited about something that you're writing about.

Julian Shapiro (42:53):
I agree. And that's why I tell people when you first encounter something that to you is novel, write down with a score, like let's say out a five, zero to five, how novel that thing was to you when you first heard it. You want to remember and capture the degree of novelty, because to your point, Lenny, it's going to become less novel over time. And then if you pull that out of your idea bank for a blog post in two years, it'll like, oh yeah, that will blow people's minds, even it doesn't blow my mind today.

Lenny (43:16):
Good tip.

Julian Shapiro (43:17):
To your point, the way you basically get novel ideas is you go live your life and write down every time you come across something that interests or surprises you, or any time you come across something that makes you think, "Well, that's obviously not true," meaning you found something that people say that you know the lie and you're about to tell people the way the world really works. Some examples of novelty... I'm scrolling through Twitter up here. This is a tweet I wrote where I wrote, "Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults." I give zero kudos for reading a hundred books a year, but I give you massive kudos for learning efficiently and making interesting things.

Julian Shapiro (43:59):
This tweet is an example of me using novelty. As we read the key novel part, it's where I say, "Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults." That is counter-narrative novelty, because the prevailing narrative is all the smart people I've ever met, they read a ton of books. They always have a book in their hand. They're reading five books a month, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm saying no, that's a vanity metric how many books you read. That's counter-narrative. That gives people a dopamine hit. They lean in. They want to see what my punchline is and that tweet got a lot of engagement.

Julian Shapiro (44:33):
One more example. See if you can catch the novelty here. New tweet, "The world is not run by exceptional people. This is the hidden reason for imposter syndrome. We mistakenly think imposter syndrome is due to low confidence or low anxiety. No. It's caused by not accepting that your new world-class peers aren't that special. It's just discipline." The key statement there that has the novelty is the world is not run by exceptional people, and the type of novelty being used there is counterintuitive. Your intuition is the world's run by the best of the best or many of these experts are there for a reason.

Julian Shapiro (45:15):
I'm saying not in most cases. Anyway, those are some examples of novelty. Of course, these tweets took off largely due to that reason. People love having their eyes opened. They'll reflexively retweet you to agree with your worldview if they feel like you're finally speaking truth, the power, in some sense, if that makes sense.

Lenny (45:34):
We'll link to those in the show notes. By the way, I love your reading your own tweets voice that you have.

Julian Shapiro (45:40):
I'm adopting my... Who's the guy from Star Trek who's amazing, who reads the kids?

Lenny (45:45):
Oh yeah, LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow.

Julian Shapiro (45:49):
There you go. That's my voice.

Lenny (45:50):
Julian Shapiro, the new LeVar Burton. I know you have to run in not too long from now. We have two more topics. How about I set up both topics and then you kind of talk through as much as you want with each? That sound good?

Julian Shapiro (46:01):
Sure.

Lenny (46:01):
Cool. The fourth topic we want to talk about is topic selection, how meta, essentially picking what to write about, and you have a bunch of great advice on what's worth writing about and the framework around that. And then the fifth idea is something you called it the Creativity Faucet, which is essentially how to get more creative. I will turn it over to you to share your thoughts on these topics.

Julian Shapiro (46:22):
Sure, sure. My pleasure. The way I think about topic selection, meaning what is it you should write about for your blog posts, for your newsletter, Twitter, company blog, whatever, books, is you choose topics based on two factors, what would you actually be able to complete so you're not going to give a pathway through and what will actually be high quality. I have a framework for helping you figure out what that is. Basically I believe that your likelihood to follow through on something you start writing is a function of the objective you have with writing that piece and how strong your motivation is for seeing that objective to fruition.

Julian Shapiro (47:00):
Here's what that looks like more specifically. Anytime that I write something, I'm first trying to identify what is my objective. Here's a few examples of objectives that I'll use before sitting down to write. Number one, I want to open people's eyes to prove the status quo wrong, or two, I want to articulate something that everyone's thinking about, but no one is saying. I want to cut through the noise. Another objective might be, I want to contribute original insights to my own research and experimentation. Hence, some of my handbooks. Another objective is just telling a suspenseful and emotional story that maybe imparts a lesson.

Julian Shapiro (47:34):
These are all clear cut objectives that give me a guidepost. I know that I'm done writing a piece if I can read the piece and say, "I've accomplished that particular objective," because people don't know when they're done writing, "Oh, I petered out here and this seems like a good place for an outro." With an objective, you know whether you should actually stop. But then the question is, how do you sustain the motivation to see through an objective? Again, an objective might be something like open people's eyes by proving the status quo wrong. To do all the work necessary to accomplish that, you need a motivation in my opinion.

Julian Shapiro (48:08):
I'll pair one of those objectives that I've selected with a motivation. Some example motivations are, does writing this piece get something off my chest that I really badly need to get off? Or does it help me solve a nagging unsolved problem that I've been dealing with and this piece is way for me to explore and find the solution? Or is it like me obsessing over a topic that I want others to also geek out about? These are all powerful motivations that I pair with an objective to guarantee my follow through to get done writing the piece.

Julian Shapiro (48:41):
By the way, everything I've mentioned in this entire chat with you, the novelty stuff, the topic selection, PLA, state building, everything we've covered, I have tons of examples on Julian.com. That's why I'm not trying to go through every single one.

Lenny (48:55):
Yeah, and we'll link to all that.

Julian Shapiro (48:57):
Absolutely.

Lenny (48:57):
Awesome.

Julian Shapiro (48:58):
The flip side I'll point out is that I think writing quality overall is... Again, these are all me being hand wavy and these are not rules. There's no right way to write, just like there's no right way to paint. These are just frameworks I've developed, that when I use them, I'm more frequently arriving at success as far as I define it. The thing I want to point out though is that very closely tied to everything I'm talking about is my framework or my equation for determining how good any piece of writing is, is novelty times resonance. Writing quality equals novelty times resonance.

Julian Shapiro (49:36):
Novelty is like we discussed, here are all these things that are giving you dopamine hits where I'm opening your eyes about how the world really works and shocking you and elegantly synthesizing things, times resonance and resonance means I can tell you the most novel thing on the planet. But if I don't wrap it in a way that resonates and really lifts off the page and into your mind and is something you remember, then it's fairly ineffective novelty. It's more like just trivia. It's bland, dry trivia. When you add resonance to the novelty, now it becomes a beautifully written piece. Resonance is a matter of including examples, analogies, metaphors, stories.

Julian Shapiro (50:14):
Really writing quality is novelty times the storytelling power you have to make the novelty resonate in the back of people's minds. The way that I structure my writing process is draft one, I'm just focused on finding my novelty, just the backbone of what makes anything interesting. And then draft two, I come back and try to increase the resonance by embedding story and analogy and examples. That's basically my process there.

Lenny (50:41):
I like that a lot. Just to add real quick, something I've learned is that if your stuff is really useful, it doesn't have to be written beautifully. A lot of people I think are afraid of writing because they think they have to write really well, like be real good writers. What I've learned is it's okay if you're not like. You just be good enough and you'll get better the more you do it. The most important thing is the content is valuable and interesting, which I think you're describing as novelty. I just want to make sure people don't get scared away and be like, "Oh my god, I need stories and metaphors and all these beautiful writing." Initially you don't is my experience, but it helps in a big way.

Julian Shapiro (51:17):
I agree. In fact, the biggest criticism of my writing is that it is too dry, it's too novelty focused, and there's a lack of the resonance, but I do that purposely because oftentimes people can over-indulge in resonance and then it really bloats the piece. As a reader myself, I like reading super concise pieces, like reference manuals almost. I'm looking for the length from personal anecdotes, personal stories of people's lives or life lessons they've learned that they want to share with me, or actual fiction. To each their own. You're spot on. Do what you would want to read to me is the golden rule.

Lenny (51:52):
Awesome, and also don't be afraid. Don't feel like the bar's that high if you want to get started.

Julian Shapiro (51:58):
What have been your frameworks for sitting down and knowing that one of your newsletter editions is where you want it to be? And what do you think is the framework justifying that a piece is or explaining why a piece is good?

Lenny (52:10):
The thing that I always strive for is this needs to be actionable and useful. It's something someone could take and do something with that day versus just a bunch of theory and pontification and philosophy. It's like, oh, here's a thing you can go do today.

Julian Shapiro (52:25):
That's kind of my bar is make it very actionable, which I think is specific to the type of newsletter I have, not necessarily broad writing the way you're describing, but that's what I try.

Lenny (52:35):
I love that. I agree with you, my rules of thumb are like it has to be actionable, concise, and novel. I'm not sure if you've seen this as well, but to make something truly actionable, I have to leave them with a cheat sheet. Because if I have all these actionable steps, but they're spread throughout a monster newsletter edition, it's too much mental work to go and make my own cheat sheet out of and have a quick to follow series of steps. I feel like compression is a key part of making something actionable as well.

Julian Shapiro (53:06):
There's a book called On Writing Well that taught me a lot about cutting two-thirds of what you've written to get to the core of it. I'm curious, what else are you doing to try to harden each newsletter edition to make sure it's good? Is it just like, hey, this is actionable and we were pretty comprehensive and I checked it past experts? Is that the extent of it, or what are you trying to do to feel like it's fantastic? What's your review process when you pass it by others as well?

Lenny (53:30):
I'm happy to answer that, but I also know you got to run soon. I guess we could touch on... We could just save the fifth topic maybe for a follow up episode is one idea, or we could touch on it.

Julian Shapiro (53:40):
Sure. Up to you. Anything you want, my friend. If you want me to cover the next topic, super happy to. Up to you. Everyone listening right now is like, "Man, Julian's just been fucking rambling for an hour." I realized we were not having a conversation. Now I feel bad because I was so in my momentum of sharing some concepts that I didn't really have a conversation with.

Lenny (53:59):
This is very normal for this podcast, so do not stress.

Julian Shapiro (54:04):
All right. Good. Actually, you should leave this all in here so they know I feel bad. I'm not cutting anything. What was the last topic again? Remind me.

Lenny (54:12):
I was just saying, I think one of the things people really like about this podcast from what I hear often is they like that I'm not talking a lot. They kind of like that I'm letting the guests speak mostly, because a lot of podcast, the guest thinks they know at all, or sorry, the host and they just talk, talk, talk.

Julian Shapiro (54:27):
Oh, got you. The thing is you are brilliant. You're an actual host who is a useful, amazing human being and we want to hear your thoughts.

Lenny (54:35):
What was the last topic again?

Julian Shapiro (54:36):
The last topic was the Creativity Faucet. We can save that for another talk, or if you want to touch on it, we can do that too.

Lenny (54:43):
Sure. Yeah, let's do it.

Julian Shapiro (54:45):
The quick version here is that this is an idea that I saw recur across three of the most prolific creators in the world, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Neil Gaiman. Ed Sheeran might work with other producers and so on, but the basic thing between the three is they're very independent creators who are constantly making blockbusters in large part on their own. I was curious, what on earth are those three doing that very few other people are doing? Taylor Swift also. One day I actually found the answer, what is their approach to consistently making phenomenal content? The way I found it was interesting.

Julian Shapiro (55:23):
I was watching a masterclass, like Masterclass.com, with Neil Gaman and he explained his process for writing fiction novels. And then in the same year, I watched the documentary of Ed Sheeran explaining his process for writing songs and they were identical. And then a year later, I came across a YouTube video that I posted on Twitter with John Mayer spinning his process, also identical. I'm like, fuck, there's the answer. They don't have a name for their process, so I just call it the Creativity Faucet. Very quickly, what they do is they visualize their creativity as a backed up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater, and this wastewater has to be emptied before the clear water behind it can arrive.

Julian Shapiro (56:10):
Because your creativity pipe or Creativity Faucet only has one faucet, there's no shortcut to achieving the clarity, the clear water of good ideas, until you first empty the wastewater out. If we apply that to creativity at the beginning of every writing session, write out every bad idea that comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, you have to recognize bad ideas is progress. Because once they are emptied out of you, the better ideas begin to arrive. Here's the key part, why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness.

Julian Shapiro (56:53):
Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document, and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold. Like Neil and Ed, for example, they know they're not superhuman. What they're doing is in every creative session, they simply have the discipline to allot time no matter how long it takes, it could be an hour, to empty all of the bad ideas.

Julian Shapiro (57:28):
And then they're not worried about whether good ideas will come after the bad ones because they know the following process. You start with a weak imitation. You identify what makes your invitation weak, and then you iterate the imitation until it's finally original. And that is the process you have to just throw yourself into.

Lenny (57:46):
I love that. I feel like I don't do that enough. I feel like when I get to writing, I'm just like, "Okay, let's make this awesome." This is a really good reminder just to get stuff out. It connects to the concept of the shitty first draft. Just write. It'll be bad. And then you edit. You asked me this question, what my process is for writing, and most of it is just refining like a thousand times. I just kind of take a first pass and then I look at it, make it better, look at it, make it better, and just kind of keep editing for days and days and days until it's not bad.

Julian Shapiro (58:15):
I love that. That's what I've always done, until one day I was like, "I need a process here." Anyway dude, pleasure chatting. You're a gent. Sorry to all the listeners for rambling so much at a high pace. Cut anything you want. You can cut all of that. I don't care. Whatever you find interesting, go with. We're just going to have this final goodbye and that's it.

Lenny (58:36):
That was very anti-climactic. Cool, man. Where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?

Julian Shapiro (58:41):
Sure. You can go to Julian.com. It has everything, Twitter, handbooks, all that good stuff. And that's it. I hope you guys find the handbooks useful.

Lenny (58:50):
Amazing, Julian. I know you don't do a lot of podcasts. I really appreciate you being here. This was awesome. I'm excited to get this out.

Julian Shapiro (58:56):
Dude, truly my pleasure. I think you're awesome and you're why I'm doing the podcast. Really my pleasure, man. Have a great day.

# From managing people to managing AI: The leadership skills everyone needs now | Julie Zhuo

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):
Bye.

# How To Win Friends & Influence Decisions (Julie Zhuo) | Lenny & Friends Summit 2024

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
We're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:04):
It used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
I also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.

Julie Zhuo (00:00:22):
Management is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
What do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?

Julie Zhuo (00:00:43):
It's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
You have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.

Julie Zhuo (00:01:05):
You want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):
Today my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.

(00:02:18):
Having worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions. There's something in this episode for everyone. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It helps tremendously.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:26):
Thank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):
Can you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.

Julie Zhuo (00:05:46):
I'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):
So funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:12):
I even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, "We'll record it, but it's really about the audio." And now we moved into the video era.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):
So as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:32):
It's very cozy. I love it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):
That's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.

Julie Zhuo (00:06:43):
It's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):
My pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?

Julie Zhuo (00:07:24):
It honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.

(00:08:11):
And just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):
I feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.

Julie Zhuo (00:09:20):
I 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?

(00:10:07):
And these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.

(00:10:59):
So really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):
So along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]

Julie Zhuo (00:11:28):
That's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):
I'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, "Thank you. That was really helpful." So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?

Julie Zhuo (00:12:16):
The first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.

(00:13:06):
It's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):
Okay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?

Julie Zhuo (00:14:42):
So I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.

(00:15:34):
And I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):
That's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?

Julie Zhuo (00:17:01):
So we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, "Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too."I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.

(00:17:54):
And so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, "Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.

(00:18:32):
And I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):
That's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.

Julie Zhuo (00:19:30):
It is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?

(00:20:13):
But it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.

(00:21:01):
They have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):
I love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, "I should check it out." I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.

Julie Zhuo (00:22:04):
Yeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, "Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis."

(00:22:59):
And their first thing is like, "Oh, I don't really know analysis." This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, "Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me." And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, "Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn."

(00:23:43):
I am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, "These examples don't make any sense." We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):
That's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?

Julie Zhuo (00:24:49):
So I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...

Julie Zhuo (00:25:00):
... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, "Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, "Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.

(00:25:55):
And a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, "Okay, I read this, so this..." I try to explain back what I heard. "So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?" And ChatGPT will critique me. "Yes, that is right," or "No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact..." And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, "That's close, and then eventually it's like, "You were completely wrong." Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):
It's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.

Julie Zhuo (00:27:38):
So your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.

(00:28:25):
And so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, "What's going on? Why did it happen?".

(00:29:22):
And then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.

(00:30:16):
So for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.

(00:30:55):
If I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):
Yeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?

Julie Zhuo (00:31:47):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):
I had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:01):
Yep, yep

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):
Okay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, "No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition," all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?

Julie Zhuo (00:32:46):
There's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.

(00:33:32):
It just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, "Oh, my company's amazing, people love us," blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.

(00:34:07):
And if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.

(00:34:57):
So that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.

(00:35:49):
And I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, "No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure." And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.

(00:36:18):
It's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):
I was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, "Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?

Julie Zhuo (00:37:34):
I think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?

(00:38:25):
And so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?

(00:39:16):
If we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, "Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.".

(00:39:44):
So I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, "Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):
This reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, "Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, "How do you survive through this?" And his advice is just, he's like, "I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'" And he's always embracing with "This is good." And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.

Julie Zhuo (00:40:55):
I think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):
There's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:11):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):
What a time to be alive.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:12):
What a time.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):
Okay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.

Julie Zhuo (00:42:43):
The first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, "Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical..." People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.

(00:43:18):
There's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):
Pretty good.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:51):
How good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):
So-so. Okay, thank you.

Julie Zhuo (00:43:58):
How good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like "Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement."

(00:44:48):
And ideally you're not like, "Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk," right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.

(00:45:42):
I'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, "Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, "Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet." And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.

(00:47:18):
And so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, "Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.

(00:48:04):
So I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.

(00:48:31):
And that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, "Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):
I love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, "Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough," it sounds like, so one option is just like, "Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything." What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?

Julie Zhuo (00:49:54):
Oo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...

Julie Zhuo (00:50:00):
... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, "I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%," and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, "I want to be able..." Let's say your high level goal is, "I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing."

(00:50:53):
So again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, "Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?"

(00:51:03):
And if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, "Hey, do you want to be a manager?"

(00:51:06):
You're like, "Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that."

(00:51:13):
But if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, "Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion."

(00:51:43):
So I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, "But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet."

(00:52:12):
And then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, "Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?"

(00:52:26):
You can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):
This is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:01):
That's right.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):
Yeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, "I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone." And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.

Julie Zhuo (00:53:17):
Yeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, "You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP."

(00:53:33):
And at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):
And along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.

Julie Zhuo (00:54:26):
A hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, "Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired."

(00:54:39):
So there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, "Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about." You should suggest that to your manager.

(00:55:16):
But the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, "What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?"

(00:55:25):
And then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, "Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?"

(00:55:45):
That's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, "Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me." Even better, "If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill."

(00:56:11):
And so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):
It reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.

(00:57:49):
So along the lines of timeless manager, especially new manager advice, you've shared a bunch. Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?

Julie Zhuo (00:57:59):
Feedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.

(00:58:50):
And so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, "Hey, are you a better than average driver?"

(00:59:35):
And it's like 70 or 80% of people, "Yes, I'm better than average."

(00:59:38):
How could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, "Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here." Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.

(00:59:56):
So we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, "Hey, Julie, you have a leaf."

(01:00:33):
"Oh, wow, thank you." Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):
I love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, "Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?"

(01:01:06):
Could you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.

Julie Zhuo (01:01:18):
The best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, "Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'" And we've already established that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):
And this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?

Julie Zhuo (01:02:13):
It's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):
One trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, "Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?"

(01:02:53):
And everyone's like, "No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens."

(01:02:57):
And then that gives you that freedom to just, " Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here."

Julie Zhuo (01:03:09):
So if you get people to opt in, "Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback." That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.

(01:03:13):
Then the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, "Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.

(01:03:37):
But what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.

(01:04:16):
But if you've done that, you're like, "No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out," or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.

(01:04:33):
And so usually then if you're like, "Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?"

(01:04:44):
Then the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, "Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can."

(01:05:06):
That does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):
This is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?

Julie Zhuo (01:05:53):
I think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, "My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something."

(01:06:33):
And I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, "Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins." So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.

(01:07:32):
But there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.

(01:08:06):
And so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, "Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it."

(01:08:22):
That's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, "Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible..."

(01:08:31):
I'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, "No, you're wrong." And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):
Yeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, "Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you." But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, "This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else."

Julie Zhuo (01:09:27):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):
Okay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?

Julie Zhuo (01:09:41):
I think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.

(01:10:21):
I think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, "What are we here to do? What's our North Star?"

(01:10:28):
And I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, "Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?"

(01:11:18):
And if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, "I really believe in what I'm doing."

(01:11:29):
Because if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, "Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?"

(01:11:56):
Because if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, "I don't really think this is a good idea," there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):
This is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, "Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this." You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?

Julie Zhuo (01:12:44):
So I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, "My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea," you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, "Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?"

(01:13:20):
You can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, "Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones."

(01:13:36):
And so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, "Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that..."

(01:13:59):
And what we can also often do is like, "Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong."

(01:14:07):
I'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, "I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan."

(01:14:25):
But if I talk to you about it and you're like, "No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on."

(01:14:29):
Likely what starts to unfold is like, "Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states."

(01:14:45):
And so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it."

Julie Zhuo (01:15:00):
For sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, "Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):
This is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, "Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out." We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.

(01:16:07):
The first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?

Julie Zhuo (01:16:19):
Well, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):
By the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.

Julie Zhuo (01:16:34):
Okay. Yes, the birthday passed.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):
[inaudible 01:16:35].

Julie Zhuo (01:16:35):
That's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):
I haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-

Julie Zhuo (01:16:59):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
What is it called? The metha-

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Methaphone?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):
Methaphone, check this out.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:08):
Yeah, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):
It's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, "What the hell is that?" Methaphone.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:16):
Yeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):
No, I don't have that one yet.

Julie Zhuo (01:17:24):
... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, "Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?"

(01:17:35):
He's like, "Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot," and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.

(01:17:55):
I was like, "This is the best idea." My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, "I want a raccoon that can talk to him," so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, "Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an..."

(01:18:47):
I created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, "Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money." Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, "Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game." It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):
Wait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?

Julie Zhuo (01:19:37):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):
I thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:40):
No, I think I'm going to sing it myself.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):
Wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:19:43):
All of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):
Yeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?

Julie Zhuo (01:20:20):
I believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, "Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction."

(01:21:05):
Even, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, "Sit in front of a wall for an hour," and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, "This is the worst thing ever," but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):
Wow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.

Julie Zhuo (01:21:56):
It's hard.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):
Hard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.

Julie Zhuo (01:22:24):
That's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, "Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me," and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):
It's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?

Julie Zhuo (01:23:35):
I just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):
Well, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, "What if I charge for this?" That worked, and then I'm like, "What if I do a podcast?" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.

Julie Zhuo (01:24:22):
Yeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):
That's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:34):
I'm ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Julie Zhuo (01:24:39):
The first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):
Oh, wow.

Julie Zhuo (01:25:24):
I read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, "Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates." Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, "What conscious business?" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):
That is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, "Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it."

Julie Zhuo (01:26:28):
Yes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):
I am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.

Julie Zhuo (01:27:16):
Oh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):
Yes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:36):
I have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
So delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?

Julie Zhuo (01:27:49):
I don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):
The Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.

Julie Zhuo (01:28:32):
Oh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):
What? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:08):
No, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, "Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):
The app itself natively does that?

Julie Zhuo (01:29:36):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):
I did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.

Julie Zhuo (01:29:46):
Yeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):
Incredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:19):
That's awesome. That is super cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):
Holy moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?

Julie Zhuo (01:30:30):
I like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says "don't mistake Motion for progress". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):
The common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.

Julie Zhuo (01:31:02):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):
Final question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?

Julie Zhuo (01:31:20):
Emotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.

(01:32:05):
Technology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, "Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something," you got that.

(01:32:51):
But how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):
What a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?

Julie Zhuo (01:34:06):
Well, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.

(01:34:40):
But for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):
Sweet.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:16):
... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):
Just for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?

Julie Zhuo (01:35:37):
September 9th.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):
Okay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:46):
Yes, yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):
Amazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:49):
Thank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):
Hopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.

Julie Zhuo (01:35:58):

# Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen (co-founder, designer, CEO)

## Transcript

Karri Saarinen (00:00:00):
My belief is that, like any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. What happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, like the mobile or the web or something the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well designed necessarily because they are the first.

(00:00:19):
Then, as you build the 100,000 different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. It's like the bar is so high. I think today it's almost a very basic thing now. Pretty much from the very beginning, you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.

Lenny (00:00:46):
Today my guest is Karri Saarinen. Karri was the founding designer at Coinbase, principal designer at Airbnb, co-founder of two previous startups, and most recently is the co-founder and CEO of Linear, which I'm fairly confident is the fastest growing and most beloved issue tracking tool in the world and something that a growing number of product teams are using to build their own product.

(00:01:07):
Karri and his team are building their company and their product in a really unique way with a huge focus on craft and quality, no AB tests, no metrics-based goals, instead a focus on taste and opinions. Also, no durable cross-functional teams, instead teams assemble around a project and then disperse once it's done. Also, they have just one product manager as the head of product and that's it. In our conversation, Karri shares how he built a culture around quality and craft, how he makes trade-offs, and how he operationalizes quality and thoughtfulness where design can be a differentiator in competing against incumbents.

(00:01:42):
We talk about something called the linear method of building product, which is big on building opinionated software, working in consistent cycles amongst other principles. We also get into Linear's unique hiring approach, which involves a paid work trial where candidates work alongside the team for a number of days instead of just having an interview, also a glimpse into how Linear got their first 10 customers, found product market fit, and scaled their growth engine.

(00:02:06):
There is so much gold in this episode. I'm very excited for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Karri Saarinen after a short word from our sponsors.

Karri Saarinen (00:04:29):
Thanks, Lenny. It's great to be here.

Lenny (00:04:31):
Maybe to start, set a little context, can you just explain what is Linear? What does Linear do? Then, share maybe a few stats of just the scale of Linear at this point.

Karri Saarinen (00:04:41):
Linear is the project and issue tracking system that software companies and technical teams love to use. We help software companies to build software. We started 2019. Today some of the top growth companies like Block, Vercel, Ramp, Retool, Mercury, and Softstack are building with Linear. We also additionally have lots of other companies, thousands of other companies using Linear. These companies can be a very early stage team like some companies just graduated from YC or a public company.

(00:05:17):
Just briefly, why we created Linear is that, like you said, I worked with you at Airbnb and before that I worked at Coinbase. Before that, I had my own startup. All of us founders, there's three of us, we had a similar path where we worked in multiple different companies in different stages. What we saw often is that the tools available for managing software projects weren't really cutting it. I think a lot of them felt very clunky or complex or just like they had this legacy way of thinking about software development. We just felt like we should do something about it. With Linear, we set out to build this most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development. I'm also happy to share that we've been profitable the last two years. We also have this thing where we actually have this net negative lifetime burn rate, which means that we just have more cash in the bank today than we have raised. I think with a lot of startups usually the normal way is that you raise money and then you need to spend it to build it. I think since we were able to build a business pretty early on, we've been able to be in this position that actually we haven't spent any money on building the business.

Lenny (00:06:43):
That is insane. I didn't even know that. For all those reasons, a lot of founders and a lot of product leaders look up to the way Linear builds product and the way you think about product. To frame this conversation, there's three areas I want to dive into. One is just how you approach building product. Two is how you go about building the team and the business in general and then three is just how you grow Linear. To start, I want to talk about craft.

(00:07:11):
Clearly, one of the biggest reasons that people look up to Linear and use Linear is the quality of the user experience and the product. I know your team puts a lot of emphasis on craft and user experience. I imagine that also comes at the cost of some trade-offs like it takes probably longer to get stuff out the door. You're probably losing sales because people are waiting for a feature and you're not ready to launch it yet. You want to make it better. What have you learned about creating space for craft and building product that is really, really great?

Karri Saarinen (00:07:40):
I think it's interesting that those things you mentioned like hiring, building business, and building product and craft, I think that all of those are somewhat related to each other. What I can say about the product craft per se is it definitely starts with the people. On the hiring front, we always look for people that care about it. As a business, why we really care about it is that we see that cooperation only happens if people use the product and our product, which is supposed to help the cooperation, coordination.

(00:08:14):
If there's friction or the experience isn't that great or there's little paper cuts, I think it gets really annoying for people to use. We think for the business to be successful the quality and the craft is very important. There's definitely trade-offs sometimes. There can be for example timelines like we are about to launch something and then for example I or someone else goes to look at it and sees, "Oh, this doesn't feel right and we should fix it so I don't think we should launch this now."

(00:08:43):
Sometimes it does definitely push the timelines, but this might be days. It's not like we need to redo everything. The other way we think about it is we are actually very okay pushing things out to ourselves and for a small group of customers if they opt into that. Whenever we build a new feature one of the things is we don't want to spend tons of time upfront just designing it, then polishing it perfectly.

(00:09:13):
We actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work and how it should be better. A lot of times with the teams we tell them, "Just put it there in, I don't know, the first week almost. After you have some designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production." It's only visible to us so we internally can test it out.

(00:09:40):
Then, I think the next stage is we look for a customer that could be interested in this feature or we just ask people to opt in to some better program. In those stages, the experience can be a little janky or it's not that polished, but we're okay with it because we are saying, "It's not finished. We just want to get your feedback early so we can make it better." Once we get to the full general release, then we pay more attention to the actual polish or the craft.

Lenny (00:10:11):
That is so interesting. I didn't know you do that. You actually go ahead and launch things really early to a select group of people that want the early stuff. Then, did you say that you find one customer to co-create and help evolve the feature and change it?

Karri Saarinen (00:10:26):
Usually it can be one or it's three or five or 10. Often, especially with the larger company facing features, we usually do try to find a large company because sometimes it's hard to imagine these things, how they should work. It's better if someone is willing to work with us to explain, "Okay, this is how we do something." For example, we work this way with Vercel in that there was some changes they wanted to see in the roadmap feature. We worked with them to improve it and then they could give us feedback along the way.

Lenny (00:11:02):
That is so interesting because I think people seeing Linear from the outside, it feels like you just take the time you need to build something awesome. Then, it launches and it's amazing and it's great, but it turns out that isn't exactly how you build. You actually do launch things really early and people don't necessarily see it until it's done, but there's this whole process behind the scenes.

Karri Saarinen (00:11:21):
I think sometimes people think that craft is about perfecting things and perfecting them in a very organized way or very early on. The downside with this perfection mindset is that it can be sometimes hard to put anything out because nothing is ever fully perfect. We try to balance this thinking with the fact that we should be always pushing things out very quickly, but then also fixing them, improving them very quickly.

(00:11:51):
It's almost like the opposite idea, but then we try to combine that and I think it's been working well. Generally, in the company there's not necessarily a lot of reviews or something that we always review everything that gets shipped this way because we do want people to feel that they can put something in the app and then we can try it out. It's more like let's just try it out, but then we do need to look at it again before we release it to everyone.

Lenny (00:12:25):
A lot of founders, a lot of product leaders, a lot of designers definitely want to create space for craft and making products really great, something they're really proud of, but in practice it's really hard. Very few teams and companies do this. Is there anything else you've learned about creating space for this sort of thing and prioritizing it for founders that are listening that are trying to instill more and more of this or do you have to be a designer CO like Karri and really it's hard to do otherwise?

Karri Saarinen (00:12:53):
I don't think actually. It's not purely coming from me. I think all of us founders like Jori and Tuomas additionally, their background is engineering, but I would say I think they spend even more time on the details than sometimes I do. I think very early on when it was the three of us I would be the one doing the broad strokes designs like this is how the UI works and this is how some of the things work. They were the ones that were like, "Oh, there should be animation here and there should be this kind of thing here."

(00:13:27):
I think it's like that DNA I think comes from all of us. I think with the craft it always starts with people need to care about it. If it's not valued in the company, then it's very hard for anyone to do because people don't feel like it's valued. I gave this advice to some founder. He was asking me about it and in their case their founders were coming from different companies. Maybe this one founder came from Airbnb and then the other ones came from Facebook and Amazon. For example, I think Facebook and Amazon have a very different culture on quality or craft or shipping. I think it's what I said to them. You need to align on it. It's like you cannot run a company with multiple different kinds of cultures. I think I made some points like why the quality is important for certain products and you should all believe in that and then instill that with everyone you hire. The other thing I would say that we like to do is we actually don't have much PMs in the company.

(00:14:32):
We only have one and we can talk about more about it. One of the things I think that happens is when you build a team and you start creating these very specific roles for everything I think that often the PM can be the ones figuring things out and making decisions and guiding the team, but they're not the ones building the feature. They're not there looking at it the whole day like where does this button go or how does it work? I think a lot of that, this craft for us happens when we give the project team this ownership and the project team is just engineering and design.

(00:15:11):
Then, when they start building that feature they start seeing these opportunities that this thing could be better. A good example of this is one of our engineers, Andreas. When we were building this right click menu in the app so you can click different things and under that you have sub-menus. Mac OS does this well where it's when you open that menu you hover on the menu and then you want to go to the sub-menu. You hover to the right. You don't have to go exactly horizontally to get into that menu.

(00:15:44):
You can actually go diagonally or you don't actually have to hit the menu exactly. There's this safe zone, but a lot of software just implements like, "Hey, let's do this menu. Let's make the sub-menu." It only works if you exactly hover over the menu. Then, what happens is the user often misses with few pixels what they were trying to do. What Andreas did, which we didn't tell him to do, is like, "Yeah, this kind of sucks and we should make this better."

(00:16:12):
He figured out a way to create those safe areas that are dynamic based on the sub-menu positioning and everything. It's much easier now. You can go diagonally to the actual thing you want to go to. I think these things happen when you give people more of the ownership of the project and also the space to do that and then you also have leadership or generally the company culture that values the quality or the craft.

Lenny (00:16:42):
I got to follow this thread. There's a couple of questions I want to ask. You have one product manager. Would you call him the head of product?

Karri Saarinen (00:16:48):
Yeah, Nan Yu, he is the head of product.

Lenny (00:16:52):
Awesome, what made you decide to hire him and even have any PMs?

Karri Saarinen (00:16:56):
We started to see that we have enough features and areas of the product and also the team speaker that it's hard to keep aligned on all of these things or even keep track of things. Initially, we actually hired Nan as a contractor to help us with this insights data tool. We have this data tool feature built in Linear so you can get data on what's happening in the workspace. For us founders, we realized none of us, we are not super experienced in data tools. We need someone to help out.

(00:17:34):
Luckily, Nan, we knew him and he actually worked at Mode, which is a data tool. We initially hired him like, "Can you help us figure out what exactly should this data tool and how should it work?" I think there's different ways of doing that. I think always the easiest way is let's just copy what some other company is doing, but we didn't want to do that. We wanted to figure out what is actually a useful way to use this data or get this data?

(00:18:01):
He helped us with that and then we saw this could be useful in other larger areas or overall with the whole product it's like we might have these kind of questions. What should we exactly be thinking around here and why and how would we define this direction and then help the teams to also align on it? To us, it's more like he figures out the direction of the product and steers some of the efforts and not like he's there in every meeting and making every decision or writing every spec or something like that.

Lenny (00:18:38):
Another question along this line, because there's a lot of PMs listening that are going to be like, "Oh, shit, these guys don't need PMs or PM is over, product management dead." Just another question along these lines, somebody needs to do the work that a PM does basically, right? There's all these things that is on the plate of a product manager when they're at a company and if they're not there, other people have to do those things. What I'm hearing is basically you give those responsibilities to the engineers, designer, and maybe other functions within the team. Is that right?

Karri Saarinen (00:19:06):
Yeah, I mean definitely I think what it means is, and there's definitely a trade-off. I think sometimes when companies specialize roles a lot it's because it's more efficient. If the engineer spends 100% of their time coding something, then it's like they're using their skillset to the max. Then, we just think that in order to build quality things or build things in a certain way it's actually better if people actually also spend some time thinking about things and not just executing.

(00:19:35):
Yes, for every project there's a project lead. That lead can be engineer or designer. It's not a formal role or it's not based on your whatever level or it's just like you need to be certain title that you can be that. It's more like an assignment that now you are responsible getting the project started and working together with the team, figuring it out, and then communicating changes or communicating how that progress happens.

(00:20:06):
Definitely it means that the engineers or designers also have to do these things and they do need to communicate and they do need to think about the scope or things. It's a different way of doing things. Also, not everyone wants to do that, which is fine, but we on the hiring front try to hire people that are interested in the broader scope than just the specific skillset that they have.

Lenny (00:20:36):
I think those last two points are really essential. One, people often don't want to do this work and they are happy to offload it to a potential product manager. The fact that say engineers have to do all these boring PM things like communicate timelines and keep PR specs aligned and make sure timelines are hit and all that stuff and run meetings, a lot of people don't want to do that.

(00:20:57):
A lot of times they do and I think in this case people seem to really want to be doing that. The other is I think you need a really high caliber team that's very product-minded and the hiring bar needs to be very, very high for say engineers and designers to want to do all these things and be good at them. I think those are two necessary ingredients for this to work out.

Karri Saarinen (00:21:16):
Sure.

Lenny (00:21:16):
For teams that want to try this approach, especially startups that are starting out and maybe not excited about hiring product managers, is there anything else that you think is essential or important to functioning well without any product managers? You're at around 50 people at this point?

Karri Saarinen (00:21:32):
We're around 50. Probably the only thing I would say is it's the hiring front that you really need to spend more time on it. Basically, you cannot really interview engineers only for the engineering skills. You also have to interview them for the product skills. Obviously, you cannot I think expect that people have some. If you do some PM interview for them, they're not going to have the same skillset or the same understanding of the concepts or something.

(00:21:59):
The way we have done it in the past is basically I might interview them about the product. I'm not a technical person per se. I will just ask them questions about how did they do something or how do they think about something? It's similar to other roles too. We just look for does this person have opinions about products and how they work? Can they form opinions and can they use their own judgment at times? Then, can they communicate or articulate those things as well?

Lenny (00:22:30):
Awesome, I was just thinking it's interesting that a tool that, I don't think it's designed specifically for product managers, but essentially for building products like the infrastructure for building product in a team is built by a company that has one PM and very few PMs.

Karri Saarinen (00:22:43):
I mean I think in some ways I would say that with Linear we're trying to help the whole company and I think engineers is probably the largest user group of the product. I think in some ways we want to make the PM's job easier in that they have to spend less time managing everything or the day-to-day because the engineers are actually using the product and they're updating the things. For the PMs, it would be much more easier to get what is the state of things and maybe trust that much more because people actually use the product.

(00:23:18):
In some ways, I think we are trying to make it easier for everyone, easier for the engineers. They can focus more on their work. Then, for PMs I think we're trying to make it so that they can also focus more on other things than just, I don't know, managing the tool that they use. I think that's not the most important job of a PM. I think they should be thinking more of the, I don't know, bigger picture or the other problems or figuring out the next features or something.

Lenny (00:23:47):
Just one more question along these lines, there's other companies like Stripe I think waited until 200 employees to hire I think their first product manager. Snapchat I think is famous for something around that. Do you have any sense of if you think this might change, when you think you might hire more product managers? Is there a plan here or is it just see how it goes as you grow?

Karri Saarinen (00:24:05):
I think we'll definitely hire more. It's I think like what I said before. I think we like to see the PM's smarts operating on a higher level. The whole company, I think the way we are trying to build it is we have less people, but people who are more high caliber and can think about larger scope than what their current role is.

(00:24:29):
I think we're just trying to build smaller units, but more effective units, which is I think where the PMs go. There would be also less of them and they're not there at every level. I think in the future as the company grows and the team grows and the product grows, we might have several PMs that are focusing on or looking at specific areas or specific types of things of the product or specific customers or something like that.

Lenny (00:24:57):
Awesome, that was a tangent because I could not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft.

Lenny (00:25:00):
... not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft. So it feels like Linear, one of the reasons you guys have been successful is design and experience is basically a huge differentiator from other products and there's always this question of can design be enough of a differentiator in specific markets? Is there always an opportunity to build a significantly better product experience and have a real shot at disrupting an incumbent? Do you have any sense of when design can be enough of a differentiator? And this is coming from a founder trend aside, should we go big on design and experience or should we invest in distribution or new technology or something along those lines? Any thoughts there?

Karri Saarinen (00:25:41):
My belief is that any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. I think it's fairly easy to see in different, even in software or in other industries. It's like what happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, it's the mobile or the web or something, the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well-designed necessarily because they're the first. But then as you build the hundreds, thousand different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. The bar is so high.

(00:26:23):
I think today the startups, I don't know if you look at the webpage Google launched with or the webpage YouTube launched with or some of these older companies, they were very basic. If you launch that website today, no one would really pay attention. So I think the design is, it's almost like a very basic thing now, that from pretty much from the very beginning you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.

(00:26:56):
And I think it's not necessarily fair because sometimes it's like maybe the product is really good but they didn't have a designer or they didn't have time to do it and then people just dismiss it because it doesn't seem like something that they interest them. So I think that's the first thing is I think it is, and it's going to be more and more important. But I would also say design is never going to be the reason why a company is successful. It's like the company still has to have some other things. The product still needs to be something, it needs to be better in some ways or it needs to be different in some ways.

(00:27:36):
And then a design is just enabling some of these things, enable and similar to technology, it's like if you have good technology, it's easier to do certain things and the product works better in some ways than you having a bad technology or bad infrastructure.

(00:27:53):
So similar to design, I think if you have a good design or even a good brand, people are drawn into it and then it makes some user acquisition or user retention or just even people perception of the product better. I think an example is packaging and products, is like Apple or a lot of companies spend a lot of time effort into the packaging because it's kind of already sets the expectations for the user who is receiving the product. It's like even before you use the product, you start thinking that this is a high quality product and I'm going to love it. And then when you actually have it, then you actually might feel that way, unless the product is really bad and then you wouldn't feel that way.

(00:28:40):
So I think similarly, with startups or SaaS, it's like your landing page or some of the other things. It's like they are already communicating something to the user and they're setting the expectations and then I think that that can be very useful thing, especially early on when no one really knows you or knows the product or cares about you. So I think especially, I feel like design can be very good leverage in the beginning.

Lenny (00:29:08):
I think that's such an interesting insight, especially that first thing you said around how the more often and the more crowded the spaces, the more opportunity there is for design to be a differentiator. Is that roughly how you think about it?

Karri Saarinen (00:29:21):
Yeah. So I mean just think about, I don't know, any product category, basically people have then a lot of choices and then they how do they make choices? Maybe there's a specific thing they want, but a lot of people don't necessarily know what is the specific feature I want from this software. So it's more like, well what is the best one? What is the highest quality one? And if you put things side by side and people see things, people are visual. So then the design can be one of those things, it stands out, it's like, "Well, that looks the best or that looks the most quality product to me, so I'm going to use that one." When people have a lot of choices, they probably will pick the one that looks most interesting.

(00:30:04):
Then I think there is, the second part is the brand, which is something that if you can build a brand, then I think it's even the product almost doesn't matter, it becomes this kind of default. I don't know again, like Apple or Nike, it's like yeah, there's all kinds of shoes you can buy, but there's a reason for someone to buy Nike shoes other than some random brand. Even if the random brand would be actually a better shoe, they still buy Nike because they, I don't know, like the brand. So then I think both the design of the product but also the design of the brand can be very strong things that pull people to your company or to the product.

Lenny (00:30:48):
Is there anything you've learned about just building a brand over the course of building Linear, something you find to be really important in actually building that perception that Linear is really great and amazing

Karri Saarinen (00:30:59):
To me, I think the brand should be always authentic and it should, I think even if people can't articulate it, if people start to feel like something is off, I think there can be companies or startups, they think about brands like, oh brand is the logo or the colors of the website or something. And then they do the same thing and some other company does and then they think, "Okay, now we have a brand." But you actually didn't think about what's your brand, what is the message or voice you want to talk about? And it doesn't also, the brand doesn't happen overnight.

(00:31:34):
So it's basically just you start in the beginning and when you start a company you don't have no brand and so you have to create it and you create it over time by the things you do, the things you say, how you say them and how do you approach things, how do you treat customers, how do you build the website or the product? All of these things starts to build this idea, what does this company mean to me in people's heads?

(00:32:02):
I know we both worked at Airbnb and I think Brian Chesky is, I think the brand was probably the most important thing for him. And I don't know how many hours or meetings or conversations there was about the brand and the brand was always, it's part of everything the company does. Because it's true. It's like, yeah, you could book things like places to stay in a lot of places on the web, but when people think about, "Oh, I want to stay in some cool place," they're going to think about Airbnb. It's like they're not going to think about those other places. So that's the power of the brand, people stop thinking about the other things or they start understanding, okay, this is the thing for this.

Lenny (00:32:43):
And it's part of the reason Airbnb's been able to build a direct destination where people aren't Googling, I want to stay in a home. They're like airbnb.com, which gives Airbnb such a massive advantage not having to run ads on Facebook and Google or SEO. It's just like people know Airbnb and they just go straight there. And there's very few sites where people go, "I'm going to go straight there and look for some," knowing that they can also compare hotels on all these other sites.

(00:33:08):
Coming back to design briefly, just very practically, how do you guys do design reviews? Just how do you actually go about reviewing what's going at, and then this may be too big a question, but just whatever you can share here, is just how do you know when it's done? How do you know when it's ready and approved? Karri sealed, checkbox, ready to go.

Karri Saarinen (00:33:26):
We've been exploring different ways of doing this. I think today, I still run the design team, so I do see some of the designs on a weekly basis and then, or one of the other co-founders or head of product, we are basically the sponsors for the projects. So then we are responsible reviewing the work. And so we might just have a meeting where we go through, okay, well let's go through the demo and people can explain what's going on and how they think about it and why. And then we might have feedback, okay, this seems strange or something, and then just after that I might just go into the product myself and try it out. And then what happens sometimes, it's in the initial stages, obviously we're not going to start fixing everything, it's just more like let's try to get the main concept there and figure out how it works.

(00:34:27):
But then before we are launching it, I might just go in and try it out and try the different states and click it around. And sometimes I find things, like we were building this threading to comments and then when it looked all good in the demos and stuff, and then I went to try it and try different lengths of messages and stuff and then I start to see, oh, sometimes the animations are kind of janky or it's just off. They don't go the right way, the screen doesn't scroll exactly right. So then I just captured those things and send it to the team. And so we had to pull back the release a little bit until those things were fixed. That one was, it's very, I think a simple concept and it's very known concept like, okay, this is how threading comments works. So that was mostly about, okay, what's the execution of this?

(00:35:22):
But then we have projects where we are not sure exactly how this should work and we can try it ourselves. We also have to see how companies use it. So something like we built this feature project updates and it's a common thing companies do. It's like you need to write an update on a project. Is it yellow, green, red? And companies have very different ways of doing this in different tools and we just thought, well, I think it would be really nice if it's inside Linear and the team, when they work on a project, they can write the update, Linear can also capture some of the stats, what actually happened. I think with that feature it's been working well, but then also now it'd be exploring. It's like after using it a while we think, oh actually, if there could be more robust way of following these updates. Maybe the leadership could just get these updates over email or maybe when you have a lot of updates you should have a search or a filtering system or something. So I think a lot of times we just think, okay, this is the scope of it for now and we are okay launching this and the execution is good. But we know that this is not the fully figured out version and we just need to see people trying it out and see the feedback.

Lenny (00:36:36):
So it sounds like on the decision of whether it goes out or not, it's kind of this intuitive feeling from your actual experience trying it out, feeling gut level, this is ready or this needs a little work?

Karri Saarinen (00:36:46):
Yeah, I would say a lot of things that we do is more like that but we don't do AP testing or we don't do specific, go follow certain metrics or something. Sometimes we do have telemetry or we can look at how people use certain things and we sometimes do that, but that's not usually the goal we have in mind, like, yeah, we should move this number this much. So it's more about based on the understanding of the problem we have and based on the [inaudible 00:37:16], what we think is right, is this the right solution and is this a good enough solution to be released to the customers?

Lenny (00:37:24):
One more question along this thread is how do you actually structure these reviews? It sounds like you go straight to a prototype. Is there a design review phase? Is it all kind of informal and people just review, here's what we need your feedback on?

Karri Saarinen (00:37:38):
So projects don't necessarily have specific states to them, but I would say roughly, usually we do start with design. So there's some explorations on the design, there's different ways that we could approach this or sometimes there's just one way because pretty clear. But then what I said before, is that we do try to get into the building phase as quickly as possible because then we can also see is this direction actually reasonable and is there some problems it causes or how does it just generally feel here? So I think that there isn't specific review stages. It's more like, yeah, let's check on this project every week or every two weeks and then before releasing, let's also make a review of it and really test it out, is it the quality we want?

Lenny (00:38:34):
Awesome. So that's a good segue to another area I wanted to spend some time, which is the Linear Method. You espouse this way of building product that you call the Linear Method, which you publish online and willing to in the show notes. And I just want to ask a few questions around this way of building product. One is, you are big on this idea of building opinionated software. Can you talk about just what does that mean and then maybe give an example or two of how you actually have done that at Linear?

Karri Saarinen (00:39:02):
So first with the Linear Method, why did we create it in the first place? Is we just believe that there is more of this modern ways of building software and thinking about it. And we wanted to share some of our thinking on it. And that's also, it relates to how we built Linear as well. So you might understand why we make some choices because this is the way we think about making these choices. So we are trying to share our thinking behind the product and also just like, here's the product and figure it out.

(00:39:33):
So the opinionated piece, I personally have this belief that productivity software should be, and especially company software should be opinionated. I think that what the productivity software is trying to do is make people productive. And I think what productive means is you actually do something that matters for the company, which is, I don't know, build some new feature or fix something or design something.

(00:40:02):
All of those things are eventually, they provide some kind of value for the customer. I think there is this ideas or notions in the world that flexible software is great. I'm like, I think it can be great sometimes. But what happens is people start spending a lot of time figuring things out. Like, how does this feature work? You can use it in 10 different ways and then every team or everyone figures out the different way of doing it.

(00:40:27):
So our thinking is we like to provide this good default or good opinions. Like, this is how the feature works and this is how the workflow works. So you, as a user or as a team don't have to think about it and you can focus on the work you do. And the other thing is, my design mantra is always design something for someone. It is very hard to design everything for everyone because you just end up with a very generalized solution. So then what we are trying to do with the opinionated solution is that that's the best solution or at the most optimized solution we think of.

(00:41:06):
And then when you use it, hopefully you agree and you can feel that it's most optimized. So being opinionated, I think the value it provides people is you don't have to think too much or spend more time on the tool than you do on your actual work.

Lenny (00:41:23):
And then another core element of the Linear Method is something you call cycles. I know Linear is all around this idea of creating cycles and working in cycles. Can you talk about what is a cycle and how it works at Linear?

Karri Saarinen (00:41:35):
So for example, the cycles, it's optional, not that the whole team has to use it or not that the whole company has to use it, but it's there as you can turn it on or off. But basically, I think why we created cycles is that I think any team that works on software or some other products, you always have almost infinite list of things to do and that list gets longer every day. And it can be sometimes very distracting for the individual or for the team to decide, there's a new thing coming in, should we work on that or should we work on this other thing we decided in the past? So the cycles is just a way to say that for the next week or the next two weeks or whatever timeframe, we are going to work on these things and these other things we think are the priority or the focus for this timeframe.

(00:42:27):
And then the team can try to focus on those things. Now if something happens, like I don't know, we really need to jump on this other thing. At least there was some kind of initial state that we decided before we want to do these things and then now something else happened and so now we have to go on this thing. So you have an answer when someone comes to you to ask, "Why didn't you do this other thing before?" Then you can say, "Well, we did decide to do that, but then something happened and we had to do this other thing."

(00:42:56):
So the cycles, it's very similar to sprints, but we like to call it cycles because we are not really sprinting anywhere. The cycles also run on automated schedule. So it's like you don't have to think about which day does it start? Or every time, set it up manually so it just runs automatically. And so it's just meant to help the team to focus on, let's just focus on this few things and forget about the infinite list of other things that are in the background.

Lenny (00:43:27):
You mentioned earlier that you don't set metrics goals and so let me dig into that a little bit. Is that true? You don't really have number goals for features for launches and things like that? And so let me start there and then I have a follow-up question.

Karri Saarinen (00:43:41):
So we might have a company level goal sometimes, for example, weekly active users, that's a metric we want to increase or something. But in terms of specific features, we don't have goals for those. And the reason is that I think a product like us or a system that is used by different kinds of companies, and it's like a system made of multiple different parts and it's not necessarily like you want to optimize any specific thing about it. Also, companies are a little bit different, so their usage of different features can differ because they just operate slightly differently or their team size is different or the setup of the team is different or the culture is different.

(00:44:27):
So I think for example, I don't know, some Instagram or some of these apps, it's like, yeah, we need to drive engagement and that's the main feature. That's the main metric for every feature. We don't actually have that. We just think that there should be features that help companies and sometimes we can look at the metrics before we start working on it, like let's see what this state of things are, but we don't necessarily want to set, oh, we need to increase this specific metric by X. It's more like we want to solve this problem. And ideally, the success what it looks like customers agree that the problem is solved or they enjoy the solution and it's not like that the metrics went up.

Lenny (00:45:08):
So just to summarize so far, you have no metrics, you have no experiments, you have essentially no PMs, just one product leader. You spend a lot of time on design and craft and making things awesome. I'm curious just what you think it takes to make a company work in that way? Because this is pretty different from how a lot of other founders think and a lot of other product teams work.

Karri Saarinen (00:45:32):
We like to talk about this internally, I like this mixture of magic and science and how we described, there's always some level of science that we do. And I think some companies are very scientific on their product management that they like to measure everything and they do a lot of tests and things, but we just decided we don't think that's necessary or that's good for us. So the science for us, means that we do talk to users a lot and any project we start with, we do some level of user research and as founders, different people on the team, we might have weekly calls with customers or users. We also encourage everyone in the team, go to the customer Slack, they answer people questions. We have shared Slack channels with customers. Anyone, I sometimes go answer the questions there. I also see when they complain about something. I think the first part is the whole team has to be really understanding the product and the customers and the problems people are facing and have that empathy and as well as the understanding what is the state of things today.

(00:46:47):
And then we talk about that. And then sometimes we might pull up stats and see, oh, wonder, is there some kind of patterns we see, okay, these kind of companies are using this thing more and what do we think about it? But usually we have some kind of question we want to answer. It's like, I wonder what is going on. And then we look at it versus let's pull some metrics and then decide that we should increase this metric. And then the magic part is what happens when you build this understanding, everyone in the company builds. It's not like everyone has the same understanding, but everyone builds more of that customer and product understanding. Then we have discussions like what should we be doing or what decision we want to make here? Then everyone is much more informed of actual reality of the customers or the product.

(00:47:40):
And then we think you can much more use your intuition or thinking to do those decisions so you don't have to use data or metrics to back those things up. So I think the main thing is the whole company has to be with the customers or talk to them and then understand where the product might work well or where it might fall short.

Lenny (00:48:05):
That's what I imagined you were going to say, and I love hearing that. For someone that wants to create a similar culture, is there tactically anything you find, just understand if your employees and engineers, designers have enough of that context and really understand the problem?

Karri Saarinen (00:48:20):
I think it's always, different people in a company will have different understandings. It's not like you can expect everyone will every day go to see everything and has this. But we do sometimes sessions with the team or we do record videos with the customers, we write notes and we share this with people. I feel like again, it's fairly apparent, if you know your customers or the product, it's a very different way you can talk about it versus if you don't have any idea. I think if you don't have any idea, you probably don't even know what to say.

(00:48:59):
So I think it's apparent if people have that then, it's not like every project's like we need everyone to have this understanding. Probably, usually enough if one or two people have that understanding or have different understanding of different things. So I think again, I feel like it's a culture thing. I think the other thing is you just have to kind of believe in it.

(00:49:26):
I think sometimes people use data a lot or too much because they're worrying or they're afraid that, will I make the wrong choice? And I'm using data to make the choice for me. But then you might still feel like this is not the right choice, but the data is telling me is the right choice and then turns out maybe it was the right choice or not. But it's more like, again, like a practice thing. I think the company and you need to be okay that sometimes we make mistakes and we made the wrong choice and then we just can fix it. But at least we made that choice and the data didn't make that choice for us.

Lenny (00:50:03):
What's interesting about-

Karri Saarinen (00:50:00):
The data didn't make that choice for us.

Lenny (00:50:03):
What's interesting about this is if you've heard the episode on RAMP and how Ramp builds product with Geoff Charles, there's such different ways of building product. Ramp is all about velocity, shipping all the time, metrics, measuring everything. And your approach is almost the opposite. And I think what's interesting there, as a takeaway, is just there's many ways to do it. You just have to do it almost fully and you have to have really specific people. It feels like the people want to work in a certain way. And a lot of it I think also is the founder has to be natural to the way the founder operates and thinks about building and building a company.

Karri Saarinen (00:50:39):
Yeah, and for sure. And then if you look at successful companies and Amazon is very different than Apple in how they operate. And I think both of them are successful, but not in the same way.

(00:50:50):
So I think it's, again, it's like... Yeah, it's a decision you make as a company or as a founder, what kind company you want to build. I do think there is some aspects of the domain that you're in. What does that domain and the problem space require from that company? And for us, I think it's... I think we are in the retention business. And the trust business that ideally we have a company starting use Linear very early on and then they stay with us forever. And I think the only way we can do that is we need to continuously deliver them good quality product and maintain that trust that we are... That we don't fail them more or somehow otherwise mistreat them.

(00:51:36):
And I think some businesses are much more transactional where it's like, yeah, we just need to make this e-commerce sale. And then once it's done, we don't care what happens.

(00:51:47):
So our case, it's more like we really need to build this relationship over time. And then that's why I think some of the choices we make are also more about respecting the customer versus we're just wanting to drive the revenue of the company.

Something you're really good at personally is focus. I find that just trying to get you on this podcast was a lot of like, "Hey Karri. Hey, have you thought about this yet?" And I know that a lot of VCs are just reaching out to you all the time, all these really fan CVCs that are just trying to talk to you and get close to you. And I just know you're really good at avoiding shiny objects and staying really focused and really heads down. And I've always wanted to just ask you, how do you do that? Do you have any tricks, systems, processes, approaches to staying focused other than just ignore the inbox mostly?

Karri Saarinen (00:53:39):
Yeah. I don't think there's any complicated processes. And so I think one of the things, I was in YC in 2012 and one of the main things they say there is what you should be focusing on when you build a startup is talk to customers, build the product, exercise. And if you find yourself doing something else, then those three things, it's probably the wrong thing to do.

Lenny (00:54:02):
And the third one you said exercise or...

Karri Saarinen (00:54:03):
Yeah, yeah. And the exercise is that it's important for you to be healthy or not just burn yourself out. So I think it was a balance [inaudible 00:54:17] to that.

Lenny (00:54:17):
Love it.

Karri Saarinen (00:54:19):
So I'm doing those three things.

(00:54:23):
I think the thinking there is, I think we often as a company also talk about this, and very early on. And I use this the same way and I think the company can use it the same way. I think there's always things that you're supposed to do or it sounds like a good idea to do. And it could be like, yeah, come to this podcast. And I actually think before it wasn't like...

(00:54:47):
Or I always have this question, is this important to do now or is it important to maybe do later? So I think, for example, the question on this podcast is I didn't feel like it was important to do it earlier because we weren't at the stage or a scale or something that I think it'd be as interesting or something. So I think it was a better timing to do it later.

(00:55:09):
Similarly, when we built the product, initially we were just very focused on is this really important thing to do? There's always like, yeah, you could get SOC 2 security certificate. And we know that eventually we need to get it, but we don't need it today. So we just say no to that. And if customer asks for it, so we say we don't have it. And we'll have it one day but not now. And see, a lot of times people are like, "Okay, that's fine."

(00:55:38):
And then internally, we also talk about this, you knowing RPG games, you have the main quest lines and then you have the side quest lines. And we often talk about the companies avoid the side quests. There's always ideas people have and it's a good thing and it's like people have ideas, but then it might be like, "Yeah, let's make this T-shirt, so let's make this thing." And then we're like, "Well, does it help the customers? Does it help the product?" This sounds like a side quest to me, and basically means we shouldn't do it. This doesn't progress the main quest line, which is building this product and making it awesome for these customers.

(00:56:17):
So it's similar to me. It's like I operate this way personally too, that I think about "Is this important for the main quest line in building this company for me? Or is this something that I can ignore for now, or something that I can do later and it makes more sense then?"

Lenny (00:56:35):
That is such incredibly good advice. Basically ask yourself, "How important is this to do now? And is this the main quest or is this a side quest?" Amazing.

(00:56:47):
Okay, so let's talk about hiring. As with most areas, you're very, very, very deliberate about hiring. The bar is so insanely high at Linear, and you also hire very few people. So just a few questions along these lines, just one is when you're hiring people, what do you look for that you think maybe other people are not looking for enough? And where do you spend a lot of time?

Karri Saarinen (00:57:09):
I think one of the things all of us founders saw in this high-growth company is that sometimes the high growth, especially on the employee side, is not that great. It can create a lot of chaos or just messiness. Or just generally in my past and working in companies, it's almost never... It was always easier to work with a smaller team, very high quality people than with a very large team of more average people. It's almost like it's always faster and better output when you have a much more smaller team.

(00:57:43):
That was the thing with Linear too, is we just believe that you can actually build better with less people than you can with more people. So that's the basic belief we have. So then when it goes to hiring, we've been taking very slow steps on it that in almost the first year we didn't hire anyone. Then the second year we hired a couple people, and then the second year we hired a few more. We never more than doubled in a year. And that's been our guideline that we shouldn't more than double. And this might be something we change in the future that we actually might do less than that.

(00:58:20):
But when we look into hiring, it is a couple things. One is also that it obviously depends on the role, but basically I would say with every role, we often talk about there needs to be some taste or some this kind of understanding of how things are done or what's the... People have more a broader perspective than whatever their role is.

(00:58:46):
So we talked about the engineering before that they do need to do some of this BM type of stuff. And so what we look for in them is that if they have some of this skill set or product thinking, or they can articulate why some choices are better than some others, or in their past did they disagree with some of the company's choices or the team's choices, or... So we want to have this... Obviously they need to be good developers, but also do they have this a product sensibility, or do they have a judgment around that?

(00:59:22):
And this goes similar to, for example, a marketing hire is... We think about, yeah, we do need the marketing skill sets, but then we also want to see that this person also maybe is a good storyteller or they have this appreciation for writing or stories or they have a taste of what's interesting and what's not.

(00:59:46):
So I think, or when we hire operations person, we also like to see that they maybe have understanding on HR and maybe it's not their role, but they understand it. And what happens is when you have these people that are a little bit more than their title, it's like the company is, I think, much more easier to manage because it's like people can pick up things more easily or they can work together more easily because everyone has more like a shared areas or you rarely get to the point people say it's not my job. It's more like people understand, okay, yeah, I'm kind of in operations, but today I need to help on this HR thing, which is okay. And so that's what we look for people is they are more than their... They can take more scope than their skill set would assume, or what normally is expected from them.

Lenny (01:00:45):
So essentially you're looking for these Venn diagram overlappings across different functions and teammates.

Karri Saarinen (01:00:51):
Yeah. I think the other thing is, like I said before, is we want to build much... I think a company that has less employees, which means that it's... Like I said before, we don't want that many specialized roles or too specific areas of ownership or something. We just think that we could build this... We could have less people and those people can take on more scope and they can own more scope.

(01:01:19):
I think traditionally, I feel like in companies, how do you get more scope is that you advance in the levels of the company because there's a lot of different teams and different levels. And then to get any kind of scope, you need to rise into this higher levels. And what we try to do is you don't actually have to have that many levels, but people can just already, when they start, they can start owning more areas.

(01:01:45):
And I think that can be much more also interesting, not to everyone, but I think interesting to many people. And it's kind of like how I also always felt about us being a designer is I didn't feel like my job is purely just looking at the designs. I also thought I actually need to be helping this business or helping this other area as well. So I think it's just also natural to me.

Lenny (01:02:10):
Awesome. So one thing you didn't mention is you have a really unique way of interviewing, which is a paid work trial. Can you just talk about what that is? And also just while you're in that area, you talked about testing for product sensibility, so whatever you can share how you actually do that would be awesome.

Karri Saarinen (01:02:27):
Yeah. So we do with all of the employees, we've done a paid work trial and depends on the role, what it looks like, how long it is and depends on also sometimes on the person. But basically we do fairly standard interview loops where we test... We have some hiring manager interviews and then skill interviews or tests. And then the last step of the process is the work trial.

(01:02:53):
And basically, they basically come as a mini contractor to the company, and we give them a very usually fairly vague problem statements. If you're an engineer, it's like, hey, there's this feature that needs to be built. How would you build it? Then go build it. And so basically they need to first understand the problem. Then they need to scope it down to something that they can do in the timeframe that they have. And then they actually go... They get the access to a code base. They can actually go and go and build a version of it. And then at the end they can present the work they did.

(01:03:29):
And why we do this is that we just seeing that it's a very good way to see for both of us, both for the company and the candidates to see how we work together. And I think for the candidate, what they can see is, what kind of company are you joining, what is it like to work here, and what is [inaudible 01:03:53] ownership or how do I approach this?

(01:03:55):
I think a lot of engineers also like that they see the code base and they're like, oh wow, this is really clean and it's not some kind of spaghetti code type of thing situation. So I think it helps the candidates as well understand what are they signing off for, which I think can be very risky sometimes. Especially with startups, it's really hard to tell how the startup is operating just from the interviews. And in large companies, I think things are more standardized. So I think they're more similar and it's easier to make that choice. But with startups, it can be very different how companies operate.

Lenny (01:04:32):
Yeah. That is so unique and I rarely hear of a company being able to hire that way. I imagine one of the reasons you can get away with that where people don't have a full-time job for a while, while we're doing a paid trial is because Linear is such an enticing place to work. I imagine for a lot of companies they can't really do that. But I guess any thoughts on just maybe more companies can actually pull this off?

Karri Saarinen (01:04:51):
Yeah, I think it's always like if you don't ask, you don't know. I think in our case that's just been the standard and we try to work with the candidate. Let's figure out maybe we do it on the weekend or maybe we do it some other vacation holiday or something. So there can be ways we can schedule it so that it causes as little kind of problems to the candidate as possible.

(01:05:16):
And I think we only had only a few people probably have ever declined it. It's not like I think everyone else has been, at least after the fact, they've been happy that they did it because they felt like they had a much better sense of the company they're joining. And then also during that workshop, they can actually join our meetings, they get access to our Slack and Notion, and they also have one-on-one chats with some of the other people on the team.

(01:05:43):
So they already get to know people. So it's a good way for them to evaluate us as well. And then for us, it's obviously we can see... What is important for us to see is how does this person operate in this kind of environment and how do they approach problems? How do they think and are they able to make progress in a very short timeframe, which I always think it's very important for startups. In large companies, you have maybe all the time in the world to do stuff. But I think any kind of startup, even with us when we take our time doing things sometimes, it's still important. We can do things quickly if we have to.

Lenny (01:06:21):
Super cool. Just to close the thread on product sensibility, is there anything you could share of just how you actually help understand someone's strength and ability there?

Karri Saarinen (01:06:30):
Yeah. I wouldn't say we have some kind of very scientific or some special way figure it out for this. So I think a lot of it, it's like a discussion of... And I often think ask people that... Ask about their projects and I try to go deeper. It's like why was this decision made? Why do you think the decision was made? And I might ask, "Do you think it was the right decision or did you agree on it?" Or ask about what you think you would have done differently or something.

(01:07:04):
So I think it's more like I'm trying to... In this area and what their answers is. And people's answers can be very different levels. Some people might be, "Yeah, I didn't like it. Which yeah, it's not opinion, but it's not based on anything. It's just like you didn't like it. You should be able to expand on it saying well, I don't like it because in this case it would not work well for this kind of users or in this kind of context or for this kind of purposes.

(01:07:33):
So they have more of this reasoning or some kind of rational why they think this way and they can articulate that. So I think that's what we often testing for is can they do this and how well they can do it. Then there can be very wide ranges of how people do it. And when you see someone who really thinks about this stuff, it's very clear to see that they can just talk about it forever and they can go deeper and deeper. And then some people that maybe haven't had the experience or don't think this way, they're like, yeah, I don't really know. I just built it and then seemed fine.

Lenny (01:08:18):
Let's transition to the third area I wanted to spend some time on, which is growth. And basically I'd love to just understand how Linear grows and what you figured out around growth, especially in B2B SaaS.

(01:08:29):
So our first question here is just how long did it take from starting to work on Linear to launching, say, V1, something that a number of people can use?

Karri Saarinen (01:08:38):
So we started officially in 2019. Some, I think, months before that we were already exploring and prototyping the product. So I think we prototyped different kinds of designs a little bit.

(01:08:52):
And then we also, one of the things we really wanted to solve is we wanted to make the application really fast. And the way we figured out we do that is we have more of this local-based data structure where all the data lives in the client, and then it gets synced on the backends with this delta [inaudible 01:09:13].

(01:09:13):
And back then, we were just exploring different off-the-shelf solutions and systems, but there was nothing really there, so we ended up building our own. And so we spent some time prototyping that. And then once we officially, I think, started working on the company in April 2019, and then we announced the company roughly mid-April, and we had this little website up with the wait list. And then I think by May we could use it ourselves. And then we started inviting some friends to try it out.

(01:09:49):
But then I think in June, I think we started more inviting people from the wait list. And around June, July, I think we had about, I don't know, 100, 200 users on it and maybe about 10 companies or something. And then we were in this private beta stage for almost a year. And the way we did it was just like we had this wait list of people on the wait list. There was few survey questions, like what kind of tools you use today and then why do you want to use Linear and what's the company size?

(01:10:23):
And we invited people based on... We invited more smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. And then also I was trying to see who is more interested versus just, I don't know, I just want to try it out type of people. And then a year later, in June, we launched it publicly. And back then maybe we already had, I don't know, several hundred of companies using it. And then we also launched the pricing and I think almost all of them... Maybe one company didn't subscribe, but everyone else subscribed to that paid plan.

Lenny (01:11:01):
Okay. There's a number of really interesting things here. So one is you're in private beta for a year and then a year later, you launched. How long was that period between starting to incubate and starting to build to that private beta milestone?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:16):
Yeah, I think it's just a few months. I think just-

Lenny (01:11:19):
Just a few months of building the V1?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:21):
Yeah.

Lenny (01:11:22):
Wow, okay. I thought it was a lot longer. That is so interesting. Okay. What a team you've got over there.

(01:11:27):
Okay. And then this survey piece is really interesting. I've heard a little bit about this story. So essentially you launched it on Twitter. You had kind of a following. Your founders had a bit of a following, so I think that helped build up the initial wait list.

(01:11:39):
But what you did there wasn't just like, hey, go sign up for a wait list and you just add email addresses. It's a survey asking them what tools they use, whether it's GitHub or something else, and then also the size of the company and their interest. And that helped you basically prioritize who to go after and who to onboard. Is that right?

Karri Saarinen (01:11:56):
Yeah. And the reason we did it, because we know that we didn't support everything and what I said before and the focus is we want to also be focused on let's just build a version that can work for some people or some companies. We don't have to try to address everyone in the world in the first months of the business. And even before, after that. So it was very selective process. And I think we were fortunate that we were able to get people sign up on a wait list and I think after a month or so we had maybe 4,000 people on the wait list.

(01:12:34):
And then we had this internal... I think initially it was just a very manual process, but eventually we built this invite tool that we could just send invites. But in the beginning, I would go read the actual surveys in a spreadsheet, then I copied the email, and then I emailed them the invite link from my personal email. And then I would just email them after a few days or a week and it's like, "Hey, what do you think?"

(01:13:01):
And the reason we... And so we would invite only like... In the beginning, we maybe invited like 10 people a week. And eventually we increased those amounts. But the reason we did it that way was that we thought that if you just invite everyone at once or a lot of people at once, all of those people are going to probably hit the same problems in this kind of software that is very early stage. So I don't know. They hit the same bug or the same problem in the software. So then they will all send us feedback like, hey, there's this problem. And then we felt like it was a wasted effort.

(01:13:36):
So we would just do these cohorts. Let's invite these people and then they say, hey, this is a problem. This doesn't work, or something. Then we go fix that. Then after we fix that, we invite the next cohort of people. Then they say, well, there's this thing that is needed or this doesn't work, then we fix that.

(01:13:54):
So for that year, we did these cohorts and then always get the feedback from the cohort saying this is wrong or this doesn't work, and then we'll fix that. So eventually, I think it was much more... I think an effective way of doing the initial development than just inviting or letting everyone to use the product right at the beginning.

Lenny (01:14:16):
There's so many interesting lessons from this. I wanted to ask how you got your first 10 customers. And what I'm hearing essentially was from this wait list, you launched it on Twitter, people signed up, you picked people to let onboard, you worked with them over the course of a year to make it what they needed, and then eventually you started charging.

Karri Saarinen (01:14:33):
Yeah. I think the first 10 companies using it, I think maybe a little over half. Maybe there was three friends that have startups and they used it. And then I think the majority of them were just from this wait list. But they didn't pay us anything. We didn't have pricing in the beginning or during the private beta. At some point we started building the payments function, so we just added a page in the settings that you can optionally pay.

Karri Saarinen (01:15:00):
The page in the settings that you can optionally pay and then we just give you a slider that's, how much do you want to pay per seat? Then we just see if... I know some people paid $28 per seat and some people pay $1, but it doesn't matter, we just wanted to test the functionality and see what people think. After a year, when we launched, we already had... In the, I don't know, first week of launching, we had probably some hundreds of customers.

Lenny (01:15:34):
I have never heard of the approach to pricing as just an actual sliding scale where people can slide the scale themselves on how much they want to pay. Did that help you figure out what to charge, or is it mostly just an experiment?

Karri Saarinen (01:15:46):
I don't think it gave enough data to decide, but I think it was good to see that there was some people that went... I think that 20 was probably the maximum that people could pay, so I think there was some people that went to it and they felt like, "Actually, yeah, I really love the products. I'm happy to pay $20." I think at least it gave us some confidence that, if we charge for this and it's something under $20, there's going to be market for it.

Lenny (01:16:16):
I want to hear about the story of how you've started to feel product market fit, whatever that means to you. When did you start to feel like, "Wow, this is actually going to work and maybe this is going to be a real business"?

Karri Saarinen (01:16:31):
Yeah, I think we've always been, I don't know, some paranoid or... I guess maybe a paranoid is a good way about the product market fit. I think it's paranoid in a way, we are always wondering, "Do we really have it?" And, "With who do we have it?" I think it's true in our business, that... I think we started feeling it very early on, and when people first started using it and we could see, "Now the whole company is using it and they seem happier using it and the feedback is good and they might have some additional asks for us," but we started feeling like there was definitely a product market fit with certain customer and these were more smaller, early-stage companies maybe where the founder is still running the product and they care about the speed of the shipping or they have certain values in a way, so it was a good fit with them.

(01:17:27):
Then I think we always know that we want to address the whole market and also just these early-stage customers, but we knew that if a Fortune 500 company came to us then, or even today, we might not be... I don't think we can provide them the solution today that works for them, so I don't think the fit is there. For us, the way we think about is, "Do we have the fit in the specific segments?" And how strong that fit is. In the company's journey, the first year, we just focused on, "Can we get the fit..." In the first two years, we focused on, "Can we get the fit in the early stage startup segment?" Basically, the goal was, "We want to be the default for startups, the default tool that the startups pick, and I think we were able to accomplish that, but we just purely focused on that segment and getting the product market fit there.

(01:18:28):
At the same time, we started getting some larger companies and we saw, "Yeah, it's not really great for you right now, but let's work on it, making it better," so I think the last two years we've been focusing on that. It's like, "How do we make the software work better? How do we get the product market fit stronger in this larger company segments that are hundreds of people or 1000 people?"

Lenny (01:18:53):
I think this is such a good way and smart way of thinking about product market fit. A lot of people see product market fit as this binary, "I have it or I don't," and, "When am I going to really feel product market fit?" What you're describing is what I often hear, it's more of this spectrum of more and more confidence that there's product market fit and, even more specifically, it's product market fit with segments of the market. It's this map of the world and you're just slowly acquiring territory in the market with specific elements and then, over time, it grows and grows.

Karri Saarinen (01:19:23):
Yeah, I think a spectrum is a good way to think about it, too. I feel like there's this blog post written in the past where you know when you have product market fit and I think it probably... It's like that for some, I don't know, social consumer apps. If it's taking off or not, then you don't really have a lot of different segments, or you don't really think about it, you have millions of users and then you see it's taking off, so you have a product market fit. I think in more like a B2B world. I think there's always... You can have different sizes of customers, you can have different domains the customers are in, or there's different categories where you might be doing really well in one category and then not that well another.

(01:20:14):
I think maybe the countering to do things is that, actually, if you're doing really well in some category, just double down on that. This is something I talked to the Zoom founder, Eric, at some point in the company's lifecycle, and this is also what he said. When they were building Zoom in the early days, they would get this one type of customer. I don't know, maybe it's a university and then it worked really well for them. Then they're like, "How do we get more of the universities?" They would always focus on a certain customer rather than, "Let's just try to get everyone, so let's focus on everything," which is not possible. Again, it's about the focus. If you see that something is working really well, then it's almost like you should focus on doing that more until you hit some point. It's like, "Okay, now we do have that category captured or handled as much as we want," and we should expand to new area.

Lenny (01:21:12):
Essentially, look for pull and just follow that and pay attention to that.

Karri Saarinen (01:21:17):
Yeah. I think, for us, there can be sometimes... For example, now we have... Most of the AI companies are using us, so I think it's always... Before that, it was a crypto company, so I think there's... When we see these kinds of things happening, then we start to think like, "Could we do something differently or could we get more of these AI companies on board?"

Lenny (01:21:42):
Such a great lesson. Just a few more questions, you mentioned that you launched on Twitter and that led to a large wait list and a growing wait list. Is there anything you did before that to build this following? That sounds really amazing, "Cool, we just announced it on Twitter and we have this large wait list and then we grow and we get all these customers." Is there anything you did ahead of time in anticipation of this launch? Would you recommend people work on building some kind of following online before they work in a startup? Was it just like, "Hey, we happen to have this following," and it worked out? Anything along those lines you would recommend to founders these days?

Karri Saarinen (01:22:16):
Yeah. I think definitely if you have a following and, obviously, depends on what kind of following, but I think my background as a designer, I would say at Airbnb and Coinbase and other places, and I did some talks in conferences and write some blog posts. I was definitely out there and had some of that following, which was helpful, but it wasn't like I have hundreds of thousands of followers or millions, or something. I had maybe 10,000 or something, which is a significant number, but then I think the other thing is... I think with the announcement, one of the things we did, I think, well is I think sometimes startups do try to emulate successful, large companies too much and you do this fancy announcements where it's like, "Hey, now we are doing this fancy thing and it sounds very corporate or something."

(01:23:17):
With our announcement, we wrote it more direct or authentic to us like, "This is what we're going to do and this is why, and these are some of the things we're going to do." On a Twitter, we did the same thing. All of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this, and I think it was just much more... I think people like us could resonate more with it, so we were writing to the right audience. I think that's probably the first thing when you're announcing your company, you think about, "Who is my first audience? Who would be the best early users for this product and where are they?" And then, "How do they think about things and what kind of language do they use?" For us, it came very naturally, because we are these people.

(01:24:09):
We are in building software and these companies, and other people have seen similar things we have seen, so I think the way we announced it resonated with a lot of people. Then I think we did have some friends... I said we got some angel round where we got some friends involved. The main reason we did it was that we just felt like, in the early days, it's good to have... You feel like a real company in a way, that you have someone to answer for in a way. Even though the investors normally run your company or they don't have that much power, it's more like, "I took someone's money so I now need to make it worth it," kind of. With the announcement, again, we could use some of those people to spread the message as well.

Lenny (01:24:57):
To close out our conversation, just a couple more broad questions. You have a pretty unique culture at Linear, and I know one fun thing that you do is you have this baking competition. Can you talk about that and what it is you do there?

Karri Saarinen (01:25:12):
Yeah. Since we are a fully remote and distributed company, so we have people in Europe and US, a lot of group gatherings are challenging. Remote group sessions are challenging, because the time zones are so different, so some of the basic things, like happy hours, don't really work that well. Also, Zoom happy hours is probably not that fun anyway. I think a lot of people in the company watch The Great British Baking Show, so we decided, "Maybe we do something like that," where basically, we would just pick a recipe. Firstly, it was baking, now we expanded to cooking recipes, too. We just pick a recipe that is somewhat reasonable to do in a few hours, in a couple of hours, and it doesn't require tons of equipment or skill, or something. Then we just tell people, "Go buy the ingredients, use the company card," everyone has a company card, "And then hop on Zoom on this day."

(01:26:18):
For me, since I'm in California, it's like 8:00 AM, so we started the baking or cooking then. We've made things like roll cake and lemon meringue pie, and we made some [Portuguese 01:26:35], which is Portuguese pastry. Then we just hop on the Zoom, everyone's doing their thing, following the recipe, and then sometimes people have questions like, "Hey," I don't know, "I'm stuck with this," or, "My dough looks weird, does your dough look like this?" People can help each other and then also chitchat about whatever random things at the same time. Then we do the thing and then everyone takes pictures and posts on the Slack channel, it's what they achieved. I think we have friendly competitions like who did it best, so people sometimes put a lot of effort into the decorations and visuals.

(01:27:17):
In a way, it's, again, a craft thing that we do. I think baking and cooking and these kinds of things are also a craft, so we liked it that way. Yeah, we've been basically doing it quarterly since the beginning of the company. Yeah, the latest thing, we were a little bit... I think didn't have that much time, because we decided to do an easier thing, which is a summer drink recipe, so I think people made matcha drinks and some coconut drinks or white iced tea, or something. Yeah, that was interesting to do.

Lenny (01:27:55):
Have you ever won one of these competitions yourself?

Karri Saarinen (01:27:59):
I don't know if we declare winners that much, but I do think I do... Since I'm a designer, I do have some advantages on the visual presentation, so I think that I generally do well on that. Obviously, with this remote competition, that's the only thing you can really look for. It's not necessarily about the taste or the texture, because you can't really taste it through the Zoom.

Lenny (01:28:27):
Maybe as a last question, just again broadly, you've gone from being an IC designer, manager of designers, to the CEO of very fast-growing company. What's something that you've learned about leadership over the journey of Linear that maybe you didn't expect?

Karri Saarinen (01:28:43):
For some reason, it was surprising to me, I think, that being a CEO or some of these leadership roles is that you end up doing so many different things. When I was a designer, even if I would be some high-level designer in some company, you're just mostly focusing on the design and that's your job, but then when you're a CEO, then every week or every day, there's some different thing going on. Sometimes there can be problems, but a lot of times, it's like, "Hey, we need to figure out how we're going to do this. How are we going to do this compensation?" Or, "How are we going to do this marketing plan?" Or, "How are we going to do this offsite thing?" What's definitely challenging for me is handling that different kinds of things that come to you and staying somewhat focused, still, on something.

(01:29:42):
I think I haven't necessarily fully figured it out, but I also figured it out, that hiring and delegation helps with this, that if you can find other leaders that can take on certain areas, that's helpful. That's the main thing, that it's a very wide range of things that you maybe didn't have experience before, but also, I think it's interesting for me to learn about these things. You learn about the financials and you learn about legal things, and then you start to feel like, "Actually, I know something about this thing," over time.

Lenny (01:30:18):
For the actual final question, before we get to very exciting lightning round, what's just the future of Linear? What's coming? What's happening in the future? Anything you can share?

Karri Saarinen (01:30:27):
Yeah, I think there's always things we're working on and improving. One, a newer thing we're working on is this feature called Asks. Basically, what it is is that... We see that, in a company, there can be a lot of different people that need to interact with the product team or different people that need to interact with this team, but they're not necessarily in Linear or part of this team. We'd be building this an Ask feature, which is an integration to Slack where you can very easily go to a Slack channel and then ask your question. You need something from this team, maybe it's the IT team, that you need a laptop, or maybe it's the infrastructure team and you need something from them, then the team that is handling the request, they can very easily send it to Linear, into this triage that we have, and then they can start doing stuff with it.

(01:31:26):
If they have questions or additional questions to the actual person who requested it, we can send those messages back to the person through Slack, so they don't actually have to go to Linear or they don't have to be a Linear user to use it. We think this is just a good way for the company, or the whole company, to be more potentially involved in the product operations without having to be a power user of Linear, because not every function really uses it or needs to use it.

Lenny (01:32:01):
Awesome. What a cool peek at something coming out soon, or maybe out by the time this comes out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a bunch of questions for you. Are you ready?

Karri Saarinen (01:32:13):
Yeah, I'm ready.

Lenny (01:32:14):
All right. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Karri Saarinen (01:32:20):
Timeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander. He wasn't really an architect, but he, I think, taught in Berkeley. He has these interesting thoughts about building things and he focuses on buildings and towns and these kinds of spaces, but I think there's a lot of things that are also interesting for building software. The other book that I like is the Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, because it also talks about the quality of things and I think that's one of the main themes of the book. The thing is also that quality is so hard to define. If you actually start thinking about it, it's like, how do you define it? It's really hard to pin down, but it's like when you try something or see it, then you know if it's quality or not.

Lenny (01:33:13):
What are some recent movies or TV shows you've really enjoyed?

Karri Saarinen (01:33:17):
I think that the movie is probably John Wick 4. Obviously, there's no story in that movie, but I think it's very true to its nature, so I like that fact. Also, recently, I started watching the Silo on Apple TV, and I think I like it. It's like a good mystery and then, also, it reminds me of the Fallout games, so I like it that way, too.

Lenny (01:33:46):
I actually read the Silo books and I was really excited for the show to come out, but I mentioned this on a previous podcast, the show is so little to do with actual books. The core ideas are the same, but there's all these stories that they're just making up on the show, so I stopped watching, because that's not what I was hoping for, but-

Karri Saarinen (01:34:02):
Okay, interesting. Maybe I need to check the books later, once I watch the show.

Lenny (01:34:08):
Yeah. Definitely, read the books, but there's three of them and only the first one is actually good. The other ones are not actually very good and I should not have read them, because it just went off the rails a little bit. Anyway, next question. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?

Karri Saarinen (01:34:22):
I think, usually, I like to ask, what is the candidate most proud of and why? On their professional life or otherwise, what they're most proud of and why. Then I think we can go deeper on that, but I think it gives you a little bit of indication, what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well and we can spend time on it versus just asking something more like negative things.

Lenny (01:34:52):
What are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you really, really like?

Karri Saarinen (01:34:58):
I'm not sure if I discovered them recently, but recently in this home office, I've been installing some of these hue lights and I really like them, because throughout the day, I can have more harsh lighting, because I'm in meetings or something, and then in the evening, I can change the temperature. I make it much more red or orange, or something. I think it's nice that you can transition the space. It's like, "Okay, now I'm working and now I'm doing something else." You can use the lights to indicate that.

Lenny (01:35:31):
That is so cool. Do you automate the schedule or you manually change the color?

Karri Saarinen (01:35:35):
Yeah, I just manually change it. On my home app, I have scenes that... There's the night scene and then there's the day scene, or the morning scene, so I just click that button and then it changes the lights.

Lenny (01:35:50):
That is extremely cool, I'm going to try that myself. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with people? Something you come back to a lot.

Karri Saarinen (01:36:02):
Go slow to go fast. I think, for me, it's about that. Sometimes people have a tendency to rushing into things and especially, I think, in startups, but other places too, you have this like... I think urgency is important, but then sometimes you have too much urgency and you are rushing things, and what happens is that you rushed it and now you need to come back to fix it. I think sometimes I like to think that you should take some time to actually think about it and, "What are you going to do?" And then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster that way than going back and forth and fixing things.

Lenny (01:36:42):
What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?

Karri Saarinen (01:36:45):
I think it's respecting people and things. I think the people respect is pretty obvious, but I think with the things you have, also, I think you should take good care of them when you use them. I don't know, clean them or put them away, and then they're ready for the next time. I think I like that, though. Rather than you treating things like they're trash or not that valuable, you should treat things that they are valuable.

Lenny (01:37:16):
Final question. You were born in Finland, I think you grew up in Finland. What is a Finnish food that people should definitely try to get as soon as they can?

Karri Saarinen (01:37:25):
One is this salmon soup, and it might sound weird, a fish soup, maybe it's not going to be that interesting. It's a creamy soup, it's on potatoes, carrots, and other things, and it's almost like a little bit of sweet flavor to it. You can make it yourself at home or you can... If you go to Finland, there's probably always a few restaurants that offer it.

Lenny (01:37:52):
Okay, amazing. Is that something we could get here or you have to go to Finland to get it?

Karri Saarinen (01:37:56):
I don't think I've ever seen it here in the US in any restaurant, but it's not very hard to make it yourself. You can probably Google a recipe. Basically, you just need some salmon, some basic spices and some cream and some fruit, vegetables.

Lenny (01:38:13):
All right. Next episode, we're going to do a cooking show with Karri. Karri, thank you so much for being here. You're building a very special company in a really unique way, and I think many founders and many product builders can learn a ton from watching you operate in the business that you're building. Again, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe ask you some more questions, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Karri Saarinen (01:38:38):
Yeah. I'm on Twitter, my name, Karri Saarinen. We also have the Linear account, which I think is interesting. That's just @Linear. I hope everyone can check out Linear and see if it could work for them in their company, and figure out if there's a pilot. I think we are always happy to assist on those things, if you just want to try it out and try it with the team, we can help you to set it up and help you to understand how to use the product.

Lenny (01:39:09):
Awesome. It's just Linear, the app, right? Is that the URL?

Karri Saarinen (01:39:13):
Yes.

Lenny (01:39:14):
Awesome. Okay, easy-peasy. Amazing. Karri, again, thank you so much for being here. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

# Twitter’s ex-Head of Product on Elon, consumer products, culture, more | Kayvon Beykpour

## Transcript

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:00):
The first time I ever met Elon was over FaceTime. He was just like, "Do you want to just come hang out? You can swipe left or swipe right."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):
You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:15):
We wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):
Here's a list of stuff that your team shipped while you were there, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, Fleets, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, Twitter Blue, Spaces, and obviously, live video.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:31):
The sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):
This was all relatively quickly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:00:39):
I was like, "I might flame out completely, but Hell if I don't try."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):
Today, my guest is Kayvon Beykpour. Kayvon was the beloved and longest-tenured head of product at Twitter and also GM of the consumer business at Twitter up until the day that it was sold to Elon Musk. He landed at Twitter through an acquisition of his company, Periscope, which was the world's largest live-streaming platform, which ended up inspiring Instagram Live, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and basically every other social network getting into live video. He sold the company to Twitter in 2015, continued leading Periscope for a number of years, and then moved into leading product and then the entire consumer business.

(00:01:19):
In our wide-ranging conversation, Kayvon shares what it was like getting Elon up to speed at Twitter, what it was like to be fired from Twitter, which actually happened during his pat leave. He also shares all kinds of lessons and stories from transforming Twitter's internal culture from a risk-averse, stagnant, product org to one that was shipping major features regularly. We talk about how they used acquihires and up-and-coming hungry product leaders to lead new initiatives and break through many of their sacred cows.

(00:01:47):
We also get into jobs-to-be-done, Elon's layoffs of most of Twitter's staff after the acquisition, his lessons from building and shutting down Periscope, and also building consumer products in general, and so much more. This episode is full of stories and lessons and a bunch of stuff that you haven't heard anywhere else. With that, I bring you Kayvon Beykpour after a short word from our sponsors.

It's used by leading product orgs like Canva, Notion, Loom, Linear, and Descript to accurately integrate the voice of the customer into your product development process, helping you build best-in-class products.

(00:02:46):
What makes Enterpret special is its ability to build customer-specific, adaptive AI models that provide the most granular and accurate categorization of all your customer feedback, and also connect customer feedback to revenue impact to help product leaders confidently prioritize things that will actually move the needle for your business. If you want a custom model built for your organization so that you can automate your feedback loops and prioritize your roadmap with confidence, get in touch with the team at enterpret.com/lenny.

(00:03:23):
Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug.

(00:03:45):
Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/lenny.

(00:04:28):
Kayvon, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:04:35):
Thanks so much for having me, Lenny. Great to meet you finally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):
It's amazing to meet you. I think this is going to be quite a unique and interesting podcast. A big thank you to Scott Belsky, illustrious former podcast guest for introducing us. When he introduced us, the one thing that he told me is that "Hopefully, Kayvon will share the story about our time getting Elon up to speed at Twitter." I would love to hear that story. I bet other people would too. Are you able to share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:05:03):
When all the drama went down with Twitter and Elon ended up buying the company and after the eight months saga of legal back and forth ended up actually taking control of the company, there was that first two-day period where it was complete chaos at Twitter with the sink and Elon spreading his tentacles trying to find out who are the people that he wants to keep and what are the projects that are interesting. In the midst of all that, Scott ended up getting contacted and being asked, "Who should Elon talk to?" Scott recommended that Elon chat with me.

(00:05:42):
So, the first time I ever met Elon was over at FaceTime where Elon was just very curious to ask, "Hey, you were at Twitter for a while. You seem to have done some things. What should I be digging into, and who I be talking to?" At the end of that conversation, we ended up arranging an in-person meeting where Scott and I went to Twitter HQ to actually meet Elon. I think this was day two of Elon having brought the sink in. So, we had this really bizarre, wild, but really fun experience of walking into Twitter HQ, and in my case, walking back to Twitter HQ for the first time after having been fired, which was a very strange experience for me, and we walked into the building.

(00:06:29):
I was scurried through the back door because I didn't want to make a scene and make it ... There was a lot of rumors around is Kayvon coming back, and I just wanted to avoid all of that. So, it was just a very weird experience of being scurried through the elevator and through the back door and go to this massive conference room, which we had on the second floor of the 110th building.

(00:06:53):
In that massive conference room, it was me, Scott, Elon, and then at the very, very end of the room, Walter Isaacson, who by the way, I had a hard time. I knew I recognized. I'd never met Walter in person, but I was like, "Is that Walter Isaacson?" But he said nothing the entire time, and we had probably a two-hour conversation talking about the past, the future of Twitter, the good, the bad, the ugly. At the very end of the conversation, Walter came up and introduced himself and was like, "Hi, I'm Walter. Can I get your information just in case I need to ask any follow-up questions?" And I was like, "Oh, shit. I guess that whole conversation was on the record. I don't know."

(00:07:31):
So, it was a very surreal experience for a bunch of reasons, including just being weird for me since I was very conflicted about coming back to Twitter, even physically in the office. But I must say it was really fun. It was fun talking to someone. Obviously Elon, I'd never met him before, and he's one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. So, that was exciting to go into that meeting. Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, "Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want. And by the way, here's some crazy dreams I have for doing it."

(00:08:35):
It was just a really ... As someone who had had their own dreams for the product, witnessing that it was really unusual and cool. I think that's probably what Scott meant when he said, "You should ask Kayvon about that," was that I think we both kind of recognized that something's about to happen here. Obviously, you have this very public spectacle of someone essentially having a takeover of a public company, but all of that stuff aside, also, you could tell Elon was scheming and cooking up, "What am I going to do with this?" It was cool to see that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):
That's an amazing story. I love the Walter Isaacson component of it. Do you feel like you made a dent on his approach and way of thinking? Obviously, he made a lot of big radical changes. Do you feel like you made a dent in his view of where Twitter should go?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:09:26):
I don't know. I certainly don't think I've made any impression on how he should run the company. I think that's Elon's going to Elon in his way, and I think he certainly has had some radical moves in terms of how he's running the company, the decisions he made, how many people he let go, how the company is structured, the culture, and all that stuff is like ... We didn't even talk about that stuff.

(00:09:49):
I think what we spent time talking about is I shared my perspective with him of people I thought who were exceptional, who were at the company, and if I was in his shoes, who I would spend time with and embrace. Most of the people that I mentioned are still there, which is awesome, and they seem to be A, empowered, which is great, and B, having fun, which is awesome. So, hopefully, that stuff is useful.

(00:10:16):
We spent a bunch of time brainstorming products, and I had my set of projects that I was very passionate about because we'd given birth to them. I think a bunch of those projects, it seems like Twitter's still investing in and putting a lot of energy behind like Community Notes, which at the time was called Birdwatch. But I always felt really bullish on that being the future of essentially how content is moderated on Twitter, just because it was very clear that the way we were handling content moderation among many other flaws just wasn't scalable.

(00:10:55):
Spaces and Communities and the Creator Program of helping people make money on the platform, those are projects that we started over the year-ish prior to Elon taking over. My hope, having left the company and having had a new leader come in, was that those things would be given more oxygen. It's been awesome to see that those have been continuing to grow and be molded in different directions. Yeah, I think in that sense, I hope that our brainstorm was useful, but for all I know he doesn't even remember the conversation.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):
I freaking love Community Notes. It's such an amazing product. Let me ask two more dramatic-oriented Elon Twitter questions just to get these out of the way. The first is you said you were fired. I don't know if you've shared that publicly. People always wondered, I think, what happened. I know you tweeted during your pat leave, "I'm leaving Twitter," and no one really knows the story as far as I know. What actually went on there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:11:53):
It was weird, to say the least. Honestly, it took me some time to come to peace with it because it was frustrating and surprising. I guess the story of what happened starts with Jack resigning. Jack resigned in ... It was like November of 2021 at the end of the year. The board chose Parag to be the CEO of the company, and I've had a long relationship with Parag. I respect him, but I had mixed feelings about that.

(00:12:23):
To his credit, Parag very quickly addressed one of the biggest things that I was really frustrated about in the last three years essentially of my time at Twitter. One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model, meaning we had a head of consumer product, me, we had a head of revenue product, Bruce, we had a head of engineering, we had a head of design, we had head research. It was a functionally run organization.

(00:12:52):
And the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict and make sure the team is moving quickly. And Jack, for all of his amazing qualities, just wasn't operating that way, and so you had a group of highly opinionated people that often disagreed and would create either the need for consensus or deadlock. That just was driving a lot of people crazy, including me, and I think it really held us back from living up to Twitter's potential.

(00:13:29):
Anyway, all of that was super frustrating for me, and the combination of that and a dramatic change in leadership with Jack leaving and Parag coming in, I wasn't feeling too stoked. Parag to his credit, when he became CEO, quickly changed that and shifted the company to be a GM structure. And he promoted me to being the GM of consumers. So, for the prior three-ish years, having been responsible for growing Twitter's consumer product, I was only responsible for the product management team. I didn't have engineering or design, and that honestly was difficult. It's very difficult to change culture with one hand tied behind your back.

(00:14:10):
Still no regrets. Had a lot of fun. I think we had some impact, but it was frustrating. So, Parag changed that. The irony of this, by the way, is he was one of the biggest proponents of the functional structure. When he became a CEO, he changed the structure, promoted me to be the GM of consumer, and I was, at that point, one month ... This is one month before I went on pat leave because my daughter was due.

(00:14:35):
So, I went into my paternity leave being like, "All right, I'm going to give this a shot. We'll see. We'll see how this goes," as Parag addressed the biggest frustration that I had with the company and how it was being run. So, I had some trepidations but went into my pat leave feeling optimistic. Mind you, this was all before Elon was even part of the picture. He had not become a board member. There was no news about him having beef with the executive team or for that matter, trying to buy the company.

(00:15:06):
So, I went on pat leave maybe a week and a half before our daughter's due date. Three weeks goes by. In that three weeks, Elon joins the board, leaves the board, makes an offer, has a short dramatic feud about whether that goes through. And also during that time, my daughter was born. Some drama at the hospital for us, but a week afterwards, we come home. Mom's healthy. Daughter's healthy.

(00:15:35):
The day after we get home from the hospital, Parag called me and said that he was letting me go and that he was taking the team in a different direction. That night, Twitter signed a term sheet with Elon to sell the company. So, a lot happened in a very short period of time, and the reason that Parag gave is exactly what I shared publicly, which was that he wanted to take the team in a different direction. The only other thing he said is that given that new direction, he thinks that the things that I'm good at, Twitter doesn't need anymore. And the things that Twitter needs are not particularly in my skill set or in my interest.

(00:16:14):
He wasn't particularly expressive about what that direction was, but that was the reason he gave me. That was a huge bummer for me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love the company. I love the product, and also it just sucks to leave not on your own terms. And two, I was just confused. The timing was very frustrating and confusing for me, not least of which because I had just come home from the hospital while on paternity leave. But also because at that time, especially the fact that Elon was buying the company was ...

(00:16:48):
Well, I was conflicted, honestly. I was very excited because Elon is someone that I looked up to immensely, and you just look at the things that he's achieved in the world and you can't help but be inspired by that. And two, Twitter for all of, I think, the impact and progress that we had made, had a lot of challenges associated with its governance and the fact that it was constantly vulnerable as a public company. So, there's just always this drama associated with Twitter as a public company, even a private company before that, that made it extremely hard as a builder to get shit done and have the product live up to its potential.

(00:17:27):
One of the benefits of this particular takeover was that Elon offered a path towards solving all of that. It was like, "Oh, cool, now you've got one owner who happens to be, by the way, extremely opinionated about the product and a voracious consumer and creator of the product." I think there was an incredible opportunity in that that now you have this organization and this product and this incredible ecosystem that can be devoid of all the political bullshit associated with being a public company. Now, it has this conduit to just living up to its potential.

(00:17:59):
So, it was a bummer to be removed from that, I suppose, without having any agency myself. That was very a long-winded answer to your question, but that's what happened towards the end there. Like I said at the beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with it and to be at peace with it. I did eventually. Listen, there's a huge silver lining of I spent the first year of my daughter's life with her and my family. My wife Sarah had left Twitter eight months prior to me leaving, and so when's the next time we could all be together and have time and space to just enjoy each other and our new family, and frankly, to avoid a lot of the drama that ended up ensuing that not a lot of people could have predicted? The deal was on. The deal was off. It is just a whole lot of drama that I got to miss, which is the silver lining.

(00:18:53):
Then it was confusing there for a bit because when Elon did end up buying the company, in that conversation that I had with him, it was definitely ... I was conflicted about do I want to maybe spend some time working on this still? Elon was very cool about ... He actually used this phrase at the end of our conversation, which I still find hilarious. He was just like, "Do you want to just come? You seem like you care about the product, and you don't have dumb ideas. Do you want to come hang out?" And I was like, "What would my job be?" And he was like, "Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right." He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):
For ideas that come up just like, "Here, I have this idea [inaudible 00:19:41]?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:40):
No, like swipe right on whether you want to be here or swipe ... He's like, "We don't have to make this a thing. Just do you want to hang out and work on the product with us?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:40):
That's so funny.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:19:51):
So, I ended up deciding that actually, I'm just ready. I'm ready to move on. I spent enough time at this company, at this product trying to shape it into something that I was passionate about. I think it's someone else's turn, and especially Elon. If you buy it's your turn. You can do whatever you want with it.

(00:20:13):
So, that was conflicting for a bit, but I would say towards the end of the year, it was pretty clear in my mind that I was ready to move on and start thinking about other problems.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):
What I think about is there's always this tension being a PM at a company with a very strong-minded, product-oriented founder, and I feel like you would've been in the epitome worst possible situation there, where you're a product leader between Elon and the rest of org. So, I think it probably would not have worked out.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:20:40):
I'm not sure I would've been able to articulate it as succinctly as you did just now, but I think that is the feeling that I had that it's not my place anymore. I don't have a canvas to try and exert my dreams on this place. I think Elon took that mantle, and I'm excited to see what he going to do with it is the feeling I had.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):
Yeah. You've touched on this. You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time, all kinds of stuff. So, here's a list of stuff that I've gathered your team shipped while you were there. Twitter Blue, which is I think called Premium now, Spaces, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, fleets, being able to see Instagram photos in line, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, tons of UX improvements, and obviously, live video. What did you learn about how to change a product culture from a company that's very risk-averse and essentially just not shipping a lot to taking big, bold bets and becoming a lot more open to new stuff?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:21:53):
Trying to drive culture change is both one of the most challenging things and rewarding things. For the first year of my role ... There was a chapter of my time at Twitter, maybe just to backup, that was just leading Periscope. In that first chapter of maybe two years, I was not really involved with Twitter stuff all that much. That started to change when we really tried integrating Periscope with Twitter, but chapter two of my time at Twitter was when I became the head of product. That first year of being the head of product was one of the most difficult of my career not because the work was difficult, but because it was so politically and bureaucratically exhausting to try and change culture in a way that just there wasn't alignment around.

(00:22:40):
It comes back to the point I was making earlier around the organization of the company was functional, and so it is one thing for me to have some ideas and a plan and a strategy that I felt compelling. But when you have to essentially drive consensus amongst your peers across the other functions, that's a different game. That's not execution. That's politics and consensus building. I both can't stand that stuff, but I think ... This is going to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but good enough at it and I have enough patience at it that I invested the time and the energy. I think a less patient person wouldn't have bothered and would've thrown their hands up.

(00:23:25):
I think honestly, a lot of it just comes down to I had practice. At my first company that I started in college with one of my best friends, Joe, who I ended up co-founding Periscope with, we got acquired by a big, public, ad tech company called Blackboard, and we were 19 at the time. We got thrown into a public ... I was a senior executive at a public company that was not your quintessential tech company. It was even more difficult to get things done. So, through the four years I spent there, I learned a lot about how to navigate that type of environment.

(00:23:56):
It all came coming back when I was given the product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like-

Kayvon Beykpour (00:24:00):
... product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some of those plans, I think it ended up, it got easier and easier. It becomes addicting. I think people end up feeling like, oh wow, maybe these sacred cows we had didn't need to be so sacred.

(00:24:37):
And so I think after that first year, it became a lot more fun. It was still difficult, but it felt like we were all swimming in the same direction a lot more. But I think my takeaway there is you can't change culture without having alignment from the top. It's difficult to change culture when you have a pocket of a company trying to advocate for change.

(00:25:01):
So I think we got there in the end. We didn't move as much urgency as I think we drove. We were not fast enough, we were not bold enough. I was consistently dissatisfied with what I was achieving and what our team was achieving. But I think we did make a change. Twitter was an organization that had a lot of sacred cows and became very [inaudible 00:25:24] in its ways. Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working.

(00:25:42):
And listen, as much as I was kind of throwing stones from the sidelines through that period when I was in Periscope land in our separate office a few blocks away from the mothership, that focus actually did help the company for some period. The reason why Twitter went from stagnant to declining DAU growth to growing DAU again is because they refined the core. This is when they went from the reverse chronological timeline to the ranked timeline, and the year after that was a lot of knob turning. It was like, how do we make these recommendations better? How do we make our push notifications more relevant?

(00:26:16):
Now, that is not an inspiring product strategy. That does not result in the product feeling materially different or adding new capabilities, but it did return the company to user growth. And I think that the fact that it did actually calcified the organization's reticence to take any risky bets even more. So it was a very interesting predicament because when I got into the role, the goal wasn't to change that progress. We wanted to continue reaping the benefits of refining the things about the product that were working really well. What we wanted to change was a lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product was changed at all.

(00:26:58):
Because you would hear people, I mean, one of the beautiful things about working on Twitter as a product is that you have literally customers being injected into your veins. Every single day, whatever you change about a product or whatever you don't change, they're telling you what they love and what they hate. And it is both exhausting and exhilarating. It is one of the most ridiculous luxuries of product development, is working on a product that many people use and therefore you get that much feedback around.

(00:27:25):
And it was a very common thing for us to hear people say, "What are you all doing over there? The product hasn't changed in eight years." And that was horrible to hear, and I felt it too, as a critic on the sidelines, as a user who wasn't an employee who eventually became an employee, I had the same feedback. And so that was my mission. I was like, I am somehow ridiculously in this fortunate position that I've been entrusted some responsibility here. I might flame out completely, but hell if I don't try. And so that was both fun and exhausting, like I said.

(00:28:00):
But it was as simple as starting with we are voracious users of the product ourselves, and if we aren't, by the way, that's its own problem. I think that in order to build something wonderful, you have to be a customer of the product. And sure, I'm sure you could point to businesses and products where that's not the case, and I'm sure there's a flaw in that philosophy somewhere, but I've always believed that one of the best ways to build products is to be a customer yourself and to find your own pain points and to build a product that you want to use. And so that's actually not that hard to do if you're a user of Twitter and you can think critically. It was ripe with opportunity. And so it was actually really fun and amazing to be able to craft a plan that started to take a swing at some of these things.

(00:28:50):
And the other thing I'll add to this is that there were so many sacred cows at Twitter that the sacred cows are their own roadmap. It's like a built-in free roadmap of like, all right, what are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there. Everything from moving from reverse chron to a ranked feed, that was a sacred cow. Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.

(00:29:21):
It's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you don't like it or it's abusive, we're not touching that. We can't annotate tweets with [inaudible 00:29:30], all that stuff, those are all sacred cows. And the process of starting to address those one by one reveals a lot of the cultural hesitations that existed.

(00:29:43):
So yeah, I'll never forget one of the first features, and this is such a tiny feature that we worked on after I started the role, we were building this feature called hide replies. It still exists in the product today. If someone replies to one of your tweets, in the tweet details area as a reply to one of your conversations, before you had no ability, the only way you could address unwanted content was reporting it. So that was like Twitter acting as policemen and policewoman, completely unscalable and challenging, especially in the context of someone replying to one of your tweets.

(00:30:18):
And so we wanted to add a feature that let you hide a reply to one of your tweets, and it's not impacting what people say. It's not impacting free speech in the sense of you can still broadcast whatever you want, but if you're going to come into my reply space and say some shit that I don't want to see in my feed, I should be able to hide that. Tweet what you want, but don't at mention. You can't scream in my face basically.

(00:30:40):
And I remember we had a PM on our team who was leading this feature who a few weeks into this project mentioned to me that she had had a conversation with someone on the engineering team that told them, "Don't work on this feature. This is bad for your career. This is not going to launch, and you don't want to work on this. You don't want to be seen as having worked on this." Because it was so kind of anathema to we can't let people hide replies to their tweets. And I just remember hearing that and my blood was boiling. That is the most, it was such an interesting representation of the culture, not just hesitation to try new things, which by the way, that product might've failed. And that's fine, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try.

(00:31:27):
But to go so far as to dissuade someone else who was excited about experimenting with a hypothesis to see if it could help customers on the platform and telling them, "Don't work on this. It's bad for your career." As a microcosm for some of the cultural challenge we had around trying big, bold bets, which by the way, this wasn't even a big, bold bet. It was such an innocuous thing to try. But there was a lot of that and it made it very difficult without some sheer force of will and also just a lot of effort. So there was a lot of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):
Kayvon, there's fractals of stories that I could infinitely follow. There's so much interesting stuff here. One that just stands out is this idea of the sacred cows become your future roadmap. It's like flipping it from here's the thing that we're all afraid of. No, this is not what we should be doing. I think that's really interesting and could be a lesson to people.

(00:32:20):
The other is just, I love this point you made about the growth was most accelerant when you're just focusing on the core, that's what actually ... Like optimize, people bash on optimizing the existing experience and just micro-optimizing, improving, versus trying to take all these big, bold bets and experiments. Obviously, that's also valuable. But I think it's really interesting that that's what reignited growth and was responsible for growth for a while.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:32:44):
And continue to be, by the way. One of the lines that we had to maneuver was creating a portfolio of bets where some of them were not speculative at all. We knew that if we continue to invest in ML and getting better with recommendations in the main feed and through notifications and things like improving the onboarding flow, it was rife with opportunity.

(00:33:12):
You'd have really dumb things happen. We would learn. There was one just bizarre and incredible meeting we had where we finally had got more rigorous around instrumenting our onboarding flow. And we found that in a couple countries, like we had a bug with our SMS verification flow where we wanted to verify users who were signing up with a phone number and our telco integration to send SMS verification cards just wasn't working. And so a huge percentage of people signing up in the UAE and other countries just couldn't use Twitter.

(00:33:46):
And so of course at the scale that we were operating in with hundreds of millions of users, you need to be able to refine the basic building blocks of the product, and that's going to lead to reliable growth. But we wanted to balance that with a portfolio of other bets and product improvements that would materially add new capabilities. And that was a balance that I don't think existed. And by the way, I don't think we nailed it either under my tenure, but it was the driving force of what I wanted to achieve, was to create a better balance that would result in evolving the product and introducing new capabilities. And so that's what we tried to do.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):
In terms of what actually helped turn things around, things that I kind of gathered from what you shared so far, one is just building a little momentum, having some quick wins of new products that people start to get excited about. So creating more excitement down the, oh wow, we can actually try new things. There's also, it felt like there's a sense of trust that you built with Jack and execs of just like, okay, we can actually trust this team.

(00:34:47):
Also, it feels like because growth started up, there's probably a sense of like, okay, we can try some new crazy ideas. It feels like another part of your strategy was [inaudible 00:34:56] hires and bringing in these entrepreneurial folks to take the lead on some of these big ideas. Can you talk about that? Was that something you actively thought about and was that a big part of the impact there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:35:07):
Totally. Yeah. So I think a couple things. One, the only thing I'd add to what you said in terms of the ingredients, it was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once. I'm talking internally, by the way. There's a whole other component of this, which is externally how do you tell, especially for a product like Twitter where it's a consumer product that hundreds of millions of people are using, and you have many constituents, you have users, you have advertisers. And so it was very important for us to tell the story of here's what we're doing and why. Here's why you should believe in us. And by the way, give us all your constructive criticism too, because we're listening and we're going to build that into ... So that storytelling was really, really important.

(00:35:51):
And this is oversimplifying the world, but there's two types of internal team members. There are people who hear that story, who have been a part of the organization who's been slow, or maybe they've been outside the company as a user of Twitter, and they're like, I'd never really want to work there because it doesn't seem like a particularly ambitious product company. And one of two things happens when you hear that story. Either you're inspired and you're like, yeah, we can finally take a swing at making this product better. And maybe I wasn't interested in working in this company before, but I mean, this is an iconic product, and to have an opportunity to reshape it is really exciting. Or again, oversimplified world, but there are people who are very pessimistic and maybe aren't excited by that vision. Let's just stick to what we know works. We're not going to take any big swings. That's a waste of time.

(00:36:35):
I think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there. And that's something that we were terrible at, and we didn't have the organizational structure to be able to enact that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):
The wagon is they're excited and bought into this vision and want this to happen?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:37:03):
Correct, and contribute towards it. And off the wagon is like you're not at the company. And we didn't have an organizational structure that could allow for that, nor frankly, the fortitude. I include myself in this. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to make that determination. So I think we were terrible at that. And Elon is the whatever, if that's a spectrum, Elon is the opposite spectrum of that. His tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low. And I think it's one of the things that when I say A/B test, it's very interesting to see the extreme to which he has operated.

(00:37:37):
And I think I've learned a ton around, we didn't have the organizational structure nor the fortitude to be swifter, and that made cultural change way slower. We still were able to change the culture, not as much as we should have, and certainly not as quickly as we should have or efficiently as we should have. Because by the way, a lot of high performers who are aligned with that desire to change and build, they don't have the, there's not like an equal distribution of patients. If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact. So it's very difficult.

(00:38:16):
But anyway, going to your question, one of the things we found that was a really effective way of accelerating cultural change and also helping drive some of these product initiatives that were particularly speculative was doing small acquires. And really the benefit of that was, A, you bring in a founder type who is an entrepreneur, who drives urgency, who has ambition, who's ideally savvy enough to also work in the context of a large organization, which sometimes is a totally different skillset. I mean, it is a totally different skillset. And a lot of our most ambitious bets that were the riskiest and most misaligned with how the product worked or there was no easy staff to build on top of, a lot of those bets were driven by founders who we basically acquired and said, "Here, you are going to run this."

(00:39:13):
And they believed in it. They were able to rally a team around them, and it's all the attributes of a startup, but with the canvas of a product that hundreds of millions of people use and more resources. So Spaces, Communities, Community Notes, called Birdwatch back then, these were all projects driven by ... Fleets, as well. These were all projects that were run by small teams led by entrepreneurs who we acquired, like Keith Coleman runs Community Notes, last Birdwatch. He actually was my predecessor. We acquired his company so that he could be the head of product. And then when he moved on from that role, he was extremely passionate about this idea of crowdsource moderation and letting people annotate misleading content on the platform without Twitter acting as a policeman.

(00:40:03):
And that was a very speculative bet that by the way, a lot of people thought, most people thought was a terrible idea. We gave Keith a little silo to go build this vision, and then it was our job to make sure that bet didn't get suffocated in the context of a big organization that would otherwise have not had patience for it.

(00:40:26):
All of the community effort or the creator efforts started with Super Follows and tipping, and all these things were led by Esther Crawford, whose company we acquired and who had her own couple of viral moments with the Elon acquisition. But she's a phenomenal leader who, again, is a perfect example of balancing that entrepreneurial startup muscle with the savviness to be able to get things done at a large organization. Fleets was run by Mo Oladam, who's an entrepreneur, and Communities has gone through a few iterations obviously and still is in the product, but John Barnett and a team of people who we acquired from Chroma Labs.

(00:41:02):
So I think that that story of acquiring hungry, ambitious founders and giving them responsibility and latitude is a success story of Twitter's. I mean, I'm a beneficiary of such a bet as well. My company Periscope was acquired, and I was given the responsibility to eventually lead the product team. So I feel like that we ended up realizing, both through the company's history and through learning, that this is actually a very effective way to drive cultural change and to deliver impact because you need a special type of person to be able to both operate within the existing structure and change the structure, to know when to use the system and to know when to fuck the system.

(00:41:52):
And I feel like my whole life has benefited from other people taking bets on me like that, to the point that even I was like, "Really? You sure you want to?" And so I think I've enjoyed trying to pass the buck and do that for other people, and I've never regretted it. You always, taking a bet on people and especially throwing them in a deep end, which on paper they may be unqualified for, I think is one of the best ways of driving change. And by the way, supporting growth, you've learned so much more when you're thrown into the deep end than in other contexts. And so I think it's fantastic, it's an expensive strategy if you're going to go buy a bunch of companies, but it's a great strategy for the situation that we found ourselves in at Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):
It feels like every big bet was one of these companies from the list that you just shared, and I'm glad you shared Periscope, obviously. That's a great example, too. I guess maybe just a follow-up question here, is there anything you learned about how to do this well? I know you talked about maybe creating a little silo for the team, because so many companies acquire and acquihire and they just go nowhere.

(00:42:59):
So I guess just a two-part question, just like what are some tips for how to do this well at a company? And then, two, you also, we were talking offline about this previously and I think it's a really interesting point, that a lot of companies staff based on who's available versus who is right for the role, and let's wait until that person is there for us to bet on this. Can you just talk about lessons there?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:43:19):
That last one is a huge pet peeve of mine that I feel like we learned the hard way, and particularly it's a common pattern I think in highly functional organizations where you have different people making decisions on how to staff projects, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I think in the situations, in the situation we found ourselves in where we had this sort of cultural evolution that we were going through where some people just didn't agree with the things that we were prioritizing, they were begrudgingly going along with it, but you would end up in a situation where the combination of that sort of cultural shift and strategy and the fact that the way teams were being staffed was not, there's ultimately no single decision maker other than the CEO and Jack is not going to get in the weeds and debate a staffing decision on the team, resulted in a situation where oftentimes we'd have projects, like the one I mentioned about hiding replies, where there wasn't even an agreement on the team about whether this was a good idea and whether this is worth trying or how to do it.

(00:44:22):
And imagine, it's hard enough to build something from nothing. It's even harder if the team doesn't believe in it. This is to the point of just being toxic. The startup would never succeed if all the people who are working on that startup aren't to the point of being perhaps irrational obsessed with that idea. And still willing to see truth, you need to be able to see whether the thing is working or not, but if you don't believe it in the first place, I'm not betting on that succeeding.

(00:44:50):
And so this was common, and sometimes not as extreme as the examples that I mentioned, but I think one of the lessons I learned, and it's quite intuitive actually, is you need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative. It's going to make them have the sufficient level of ambition and desire to will this thing into existence. Because every project, whether big or small, there is an element of you need to will this thing into existence because it's hard. The only way you're going to get through that pain is by having that desire, and I think a very easy cheat code for an organization to employ is to say, if you're going to work on something, especially if it's speculative or risky, staff it with a set of people who believe in it and really want to learn whether this solves a customer problem or not. Because if you don't have that ingredient, it's going to drag everyone down and it's just not going to be as successful.

This kind of touches on something I wanted to touch on, which is jobs-to-be-done. This is maybe one of the most recurring controversies of the podcast, is jobs-to-be-done amazing or is it really bad and not something you should do? We've had many guests share their opinions. I feel like at Twitter, jobs-to-be-done was implemented so strictly that it burned a lot of people out on it. It's like, oh my, this is not anything anyone should ever do. I'm curious, just your lessons and experience of just with frameworks in general, the jobs-to-be- done specifically, maybe even OKRs.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:47:31):
I've only seen one interview on your show that covers this. Sriram was particularly spicy when he talked about jobs-to-be-done, which is unsurprising because. I spent a lot of time talking to Sriram about jobs-to-be-done. I mean, I guess I'll just start by saying I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful, and so it's a particularly sore subject for me because I was sort of charged with defending it and rolling it out. It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something. But...

Kayvon Beykpour (00:48:00):
It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something, but to me the critique is less about Jobs-to-be-Done though there are many critiques of it and more about every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process. And that's what happened with Jobs-to-be-Done. So I think that's my real critique of it. It's not the... I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true alternatives are outside of the narrow lens of your product.

(00:48:47):
And I think that's just healthy product thinking. You don't need a framework called Jobs-to-be-Done. You don't need to think about milkshakes in order to be able to do that. It's like you could employ common sense or you could leverage something like Jobs-to-be-Done, to be able to force your mind to think of things through that lens. So I think that's my charitable view on what Jobs-to-be-Done can help you do, but as a framework into and of itself as a sole governing principle of what to build, it's just not useful.

(00:49:14):
By the way, in the same way as, and I think Twitter had this problem as well prior to our detour around Jobs-to-be-Done, if the only way the organization is trained to think about what to build and what not to build is OKRs, it's equally unhelpful at the limit because sure, you can have a good sense of what you should build to drive metrics, but by the way, you might be focusing on the wrong metrics or that might not help you have the right balance of things to build. That might not help you see when the things that you're building are actually hostile to customers.

(00:49:47):
So just as an interesting example, the thing that I remember about your interview with Shriram, if I'm not mistaken, I think he mentioned, and I love Shriram, I'd be happy to debate him about this on his podcast, but he mentioned one of the examples I think was the Amazon. When you get order confirmation from Amazon, they intentionally bury the order details. You have to click the link and authenticate to go see what you ordered. I don't give two shits what metrics that drive for Amazon. That is one of the most customer hostile things I experience in my daily life. I order a lot of things from Amazon. I hate the fact that I can't search my email to see what I ordered. And so I think the problem with these frameworks is that you lose nuance and ultimately, and this is where I agree with Shriram, he actually mentioned this on your podcast as well, you need to be able to make trade-off decisions that balance what's right for the organization and what's right for the customer.

(00:50:43):
And sometimes based on how you devise your frameworks, your metrics aren't actually aligned with the customer's benefit. Like the Amazon example, and we had many famous examples in Twitter's history, which were the same. One of our key metrics that we always optimized Shriram growing was DAU and we had obviously the rank timeline did wonders for growing DAU and it was a great experience for many customers, but we often had features that would not lead to a good customer experience and the team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics and aggregate. And the famous example of this is we had this toggle, which we called Swish very affectionately, but it was like a sparkle icon.

(00:51:26):
Before you could switch between the rank timeline and the following, that reverse chronological timeline, which is still in the product right now, it was just the toggle. You would press a button and it would turn your feed reverse chron, which very few people use as a percentage of our users. But you had power users who really cared about having a reverse chronological timeline and we took so many baby steps on the evolution of this product. The very first baby step was you press the toggle, it turns you to reverse chron and then we would pull the rug out from underneath you and make the experience go back to the rank timeline after, I don't know, 24 hours or something like that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):
Oh, wow.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:52:03):
And the reason that the team felt strongly about keeping it this way is it was better for metrics. Why? Even if Lenny wants a reverse chron feed, we knew that he would spend more time in the app if we put them in the rank timeline and this was the number of debates that we had about this because the team understandably was like, "This is good for metrics", but at the same time you'd have customers being like, "I fucking hate this experience. I'm telling you I want reverse chron. Stop randomly changing it for me."

(00:52:34):
Instagram has I think gone through their own struggles with this as well. They tiptoed their way towards ultimately giving people control and the difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes. And sometimes those things are aligned and sometimes they're not, and the answer isn't any one framework. Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste. And so that's where my take is different. I don't think the issue is Jobs-to-be-Done, although I'm not the biggest fan of Jobs-to-be-Done. The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):
I think that's really important advice and I love hearing the details if I actually think about this stuff. Actually finding this balance is very hard in practice. I'm curious if there's something you could recommend or have learned about how to know when you've gone too far with a framework like signs like you have implemented this to religiously and maybe you should be thinking a little more broadly.

Kayvon Beykpour (00:53:41):
There's two, I think, simple and obvious ones. One is if the result of your framework is that subjectively bad decisions are being made, then something's got to change. Assuming the person who's making this assessment has good product taste, which is in of itself subjective obviously, but my personal view on this would be in the role that I had, if I saw that our organization was being incentivized to make decisions that to some non-trivial degree of the time were just bad decisions that I don't like as a user, I can't stand by as a user or builder, then something's got to change. Either bad judgment was made in following the process or the process was wrong, or if that framework, it didn't even lead to the right debates, then that's how you know. Either you have an incentive problem but the team did what they were incentivized to do or that there was bad judgment and that's a different problem obviously.

(00:54:38):
But I think in the situation we found ourselves in where the team was again understandably hyper focused on driving DAU because that was the strategy for so long. It left so little room for even taking ambitious bets that in the short term wouldn't drive DAU, like some of our bets that I still to this day believe in hurt DAU in the short term, but you had to squint and believe over time would improve some metric DAU or otherwise, like a product like Spaces. In order for Spaces to be actually used, you needed to make sure that when Lenny starts a Space that people would join. And how do you get people to join Lenny space when they're used to having an asynchronous feed of tweets? Well, you can send push notifications, you can occupy really trying real estate at the top of the app that lets people know, "Hey, Lenny's live right now. He's in a space, there's people here, come join."

(00:55:31):
Guess what happens when you put a bar at the top of the app that tells people when they're live? You move tweets down, you move ads down, DAU goes down, revenue goes down. And so if you have an organization that's just hyper focused on the thing that matters is driving DAU quarter over quarter, then that doesn't leave enough room for nuance to accommodate new speculative bets that might hurt one metric, but over time have other consequences that are positive and beneficial, like enabling an entire new vector of content creation and conversation on the platform. I guess the other answer to your question in terms of how do you know when the framework's not serving you right? When you start imagining and planning for a bunch of bets that the organization then sees is disincentivized to make successful, then something's got to change.

(00:56:17):
Either your strategy is just not the right strategy because it doesn't abide by the frameworks or the framework needs to accommodate the fact that actually we're going to try some things that in the short term either might not show up as blips on our DAU radar or are going to help some other metric that's important. And so that took us some time to get, and we tried a variety of schemes to make that work. Community Notes, the project that I was mentioning Keith started, we intentionally structured that like a startup. It was literally like we made a seed bet on Keith and his team and we were like, don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs.

(00:56:57):
And there's some pros and cons to that. A lot of our projects worked that way. Fleets started that way. Community Notes started that way and some other projects started more part of the core organization because they were so intertwined with how we were the nature of the product that it just made sense to... Separating it was going to do more harm than good. So you just have to figure out based on how execution is going, whether you've got the right framework and you've got to be willing to make adjustments when it's not working.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That's actually really helpful. The two that I'm taking away here is how often are you feeling bad about the features you're shipping? Like they're bad for users and you think they're bad for you as a user potentially. And the other is it keeping you from taking big bold bets that don't necessarily drive the metrics you're focusing on. Okay, so before I let you go, I want to spend some time on Periscope. I don't know if everybody knows the history and story of Periscope. Basically it was the biggest live video streaming platform in the world and I imagine inspired basically every other social network to build a live-streaming platform, Instagram live, Facebook, TikTok, obviously Twitter. So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story with Kobe Bryant and Periscope about him using it in some form. Can you share that story?

Kayvon Beykpour (00:58:18):
Before Periscope launched publicly, which it was in March of 2015, I want to say, we had a small beta that grew to maybe 500 people in total before we actually released the app publicly. And in that time while we were still in beta, I was trying to personally onboard every single user and I had a shtick that I did, which was we'd get them in the app and I would start a broadcast. We had a feature called Private Broadcasting that we basically built for this use case, which is someone joins, I'm going to go live and they're going to join and I'm going to show them how the app works. And we were spending a lot of time in our office, so Kobe, Chris Saka actually invited Kobe to the beta.

(00:58:59):
And so Chris connected us and I did a private broadcast and Kobe joins and I was like, it was like 10:00 PM in the office and my routine was like, let me just walk around the office talking through the mechanics of Periscope through the lens of this demo of like, "Hey, let me show you around the office and here's how the chat works and you can tap the screen to send hearts and if you want me to do something, go to the room over there, just type it in the chat and it'll come up."

(00:59:22):
And sort of showed one of the things that was unique about Periscope was it was a one to many broadcasts, but still low latency enough that it felt like a FaceTime so you could have the bidirectional communication between multiple viewers and a broadcaster. And so I was teaching him how to use the chat and showing him the office and he was playing with it and at one point through the end of the demo he posts a comment that was like, "Why the fuck would anyone want to watch someone else stream live?" And I remember my heart sank and I started fumbling through like, "Well, we think it's cool."

(01:00:03):
And before I could even get the words out, he posted like, "I'm just fucking with you, bro. This is incredible." And I just remember it was just such a surreal moment that has, I'll never forget, I mean Kobe's a legend obviously, but to have him essentially troll me while also putting a point on what was cool about the experience and that was bidirectional and something he commented on to cause the broadcaster to change their behavior or change the experience, it was a really ironic full circle of showing off how the product works. But yeah, it's one of my favorite early Periscope stories.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):
Oh man, if I kept doing that, the manual onboarding, I'd be like, "Who's coming?" Just always worried that someone else fancy is going to join. You never know who Chris Saka is getting, who he's talking to. That's amazing. Okay, so it's been about 10 years, I believe, since you sold Periscope and about six years ish since you stopped running at as CEO, something like that. Now as I shared, every single platform basically is doing this. They added live video streaming. I'm curious if there's anything you learned about just competing with these major platforms.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:01:14):
Well, there's a few reasons why Periscope failed ultimately and why we shut down the app. Obviously Periscope, the technology and the mechanics still lives on because you can go live on Twitter, you can watch live broadcasts on Twitter, you can do audio conversations on Twitter and all of that is the Periscope stack. Still there, which is awesome that the legacy lives on in a different form factor. The reason that the Periscope app failed, it really comes down to a few things. One, we did not address the core problem that retention wasn't good. Our poor retention was mapped by just an incredible surge in top-line user growth. And for Periscope, it was interesting because every month or two we would blow up in a new market that would just bring along an incredible surge in usage.

(01:02:02):
We blew up in the US, we then blew up in France. We then blew up in Turkey. We then blew up in the Middle East and you had these incredible surges, but underneath that surge, the core product had retention issues and we ultimately just did not, we didn't spend enough time prioritizing, addressing those. And in fact, we shipped product changes that made those retention issues worse. Compounding that was the fact that one of the theses behind our acquisition, the Twitter acquisition, was that we would leverage the scale and the community and the product mechanics of Twitter to make the product grow faster and also become more durable. And I think that's connects to one of the reasons why I feel like one of my learnings and one of the things that we knew but just failed to execute on was that I still am very skeptical that there can be a consumer product that is just focused on live video, like a generalized synchronous live video application for short form video I don't think can be durable on its own. I think you have to surround that product with enough features and capabilities to allow a community and an ecosystem of users to be able to stay in touch with one another asynchronously and synchronously. This is why a lot of the other products that you mentioned that incorporate live capabilities and we're shameless about copying. What was working about Periscope, they're surrounded by a scaffolding that lets people also stay in touch with each other. Asynchronously Instagram, it's an asynchronous product that has synchronous features like live. Same with TikTok obviously. And I think we were in this position where it was a live only product.

(01:03:39):
You are connecting with your audience and having a great time when you're broadcasting live, but you're not using the product to keep in touch with that community when you're not broadcasting. How often throughout the day would you broadcast live from your phone? And mind you, this is different for products that are live. There are live consumer products that focus on a specific vertical like whatnot for selling or Twitch for gaming that have very different properties that make it more durable as a standalone live product. But Periscope was really in this consumer generalized live-streaming from a phone land, and I think it was just not durable to have the product be live only. And the time it took us to integrate with Twitter was way too long. And there was reasons for that that come down to just how distracted Twitter was with its own roadmap and refining the core and they just had other fish to fry basically.

(01:04:32):
And all of that leads us to competition because at some point Facebook woke up and decided this is cool and we need to go build this. And I obviously wasn't there on the inside, but legend has it, Mark says, "Hey, you 300 people, stop what you're doing. Go basically make live exist in our product as a first [inaudible 01:04:56] experience."

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):
Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:04:57):
And if you have that level of organizational effort put on building something that by the way, you don't have to spend any time wondering what the product looks like, just go copy these features basically and make them work. And they did a lot of other savvy things too from a partnership standpoint. We had a lot of prominent streamers that ranged from influencer or just creative people that became known on Periscopes, all the way up to celebrities like Kevin Hart and others who were prolific Periscopers that Facebook just went and bought out.

(01:05:30):
They were just like, "Cool, we're going to pay you a bunch of money to stream exclusively with us." So they hit us from all sides. They had the entire company put their effort towards building live in a way that was cohesive in the core product first with Facebook and then Instagram and then also attacked it from the creator as well. And we were too slow and it was very painful to think about because it was like many other insights that Twitter had early. Twitter had the right insight, but botched the follow through. I'm not pointing fingers, I blame myself for that just as much, but there's a pattern where Twitter is really great at spotting meaningful consumer behavior changes. They spotted Vine and acquired Vine, botched it, spotted Periscope, botched it, spotted Instagram by the way, before Facebook tried to buy Instagram, Twitter was trying to buy Instagram, and there are other reasons why that didn't fall through, but it's interesting to me, it's one of the interesting aspects of Twitter's history.

(01:06:35):
They were phenomenal at spotting meaningful changes in consumer social behavior, and actually putting their money where their mouth is in terms of trying to follow through on bringing those bets in-house, but then botching the execution. And so that was one of the things that was really motivating for me when I was in my role leading product of Twitter was I didn't want to make that mistake and we didn't end as up buying anything like Vine or Periscope and keeping the product. We obviously bought lots of small acquirers, but we did obviously have a bit of a story with Clubhouse that ended up with us building Spaces and competing with them. But anyway, that was a long, rambly story. Hopefully that answered your question.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):
Yeah, there's so many. Again, it's all these fractals of thought threads I want to follow and ask you about. Real quick on the Vine and Periscope point, I was going to ask this. Twitter, as you said, had the opportunity to win in video in so many ways. Vine was amazing, killing everyone, loved it, and then it's fades away. I guess, you already shared a lot of challenges Twitter had with executing, shipping, Secret Cows, things like that. Is there anything specific with video? Was it just like, oh, this is not actually a huge priority and we're just going to ride it for now and that's why it didn't work out? Or is there anything more that?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:07:53):
No, it's even more like pathetic than that 'cause I think Twitter did believe in video, but it made this classical mistake that we also unfortunately recreated with Periscope, which was they had the insight around short-run video, they bought Vine. They then competed with Vine internally. So Vine was a separate organization within Twitter, separate office obviously in New York and then Twitter rather than integrated holistically into the product and pour gasoline on it, they built a native Twitter video feature that was a different stack, different team. It became what you think of as Twitter video now. It's like the most simple active uploading video and all the professional video tools called Media Studio that let publishers like ESPN put content. All of that was basically built as a separate team, separate organization, separate product that was competing with Vine. You had two visions for short form video that were manifesting, and that's the quickest way for things to get messy.

(01:08:58):
And of course the separate startup team is going to get, you're not going to be able to make good on the vision of buying the company and integrating it in all the right ways if you compete with it internally. And we had a similar thing happen with Periscope. We were very focused on Periscope with separate organizations, separate structures, separate app. Periscope at the time primarily was focused on UGC live video. So user-generated content being streamed from a phone. Twitter then decided to get in the premium live video business very famously with acquiring rights to Thursday night football, the NFL. Guess what happened? We competed internally rather than have a cohesive technical and product vision for how to embrace live video across the spectrum of UGC and premium live video, Twitter put a separate team in charge of premium with a separate product, separate technology stack. And so you had two ways to manifest live video on the product. It was like UGC live video, which was awkwardly not even really implemented well with Twitter at the time. And then premium live video, which had totally different UX, total different team, totally different architecture. And by the way, the company put a tremendous amount of energy and investment in talking about Twitter being a place to watch the NFL. And meanwhile you had this burgeoning UGC ecosystem, so this was like we're making the same mistake all over again. Now, luckily in the Periscope case with a lot of persistence and impatience and table pounding, we eventually fixed that mistake, but we wasted a tremendous amount of time. It was just a lot of headbutting in politics and eventually it took us a lot of time to technically reintegrate things together and now it's clean and awesome, right?

(01:10:48):
ESPN can go live with behind the scenes content at Wimbledon and it's the same technology stack and the same user experience, the powers, Lenny going live from his iPhone. But I think that was one of the reasons why it was an example of failed execution that ended up wasting time, resources and just leading to a subpar product experience that other companies I think have avoided making such mistakes. Facebook being a prime example, as frustrated, I am with them as a competitor for having really taken over the use case for live video. Got to hand it to them, brilliant execution, have a lot of respect for them. So we made sure to not make that mistake moving forward.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):
I imagine there was reason for that. Partly I imagine this calcification of just like, we can't get you done, we just need to start a new team and do this thing. I imagine it always comes from like, oh, this makes sense. And then you realize, okay, this was a terrible idea down the road.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:11:47):
Yeah, it's that and also leadership. When you don't have unified leadership around these things, you end up making decisions that are in conflict with one another. They're just need a highly opinionated person at the top that avoids that kind of messiness from a.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:01):
That kind of messiness from a product and engineering standpoint.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):
You mentioned Clubhouse, so I think what's interesting is one, many people copy Periscope as a product. I don't know if you'll describe it as copying, but it feels like spaces very inspired by Clubhouse. Do you have just a current philosophy on when it makes sense to be super inspired by another product and build it into your existing product versus like, no, you should not do this?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:12:30):
I think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste. I think some of the people who copied Periscope did so in poor taste, can't blame them. I wouldn't have done it the same way, but it worked. So you can't say it's the wrong thing. I think that it's possible to take ideas in good taste and take ideas in poor taste.

(01:13:07):
And I think with Clubhouse, we actually had been working on audio. Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former Periscope team, that when we wound down Periscope, I felt very strongly that there was still something to the idea of synchronous conversations. Because one of the famous things that I think we botched with Periscope is that we always... Our dream and our vision for Periscope and how we talked about it was was a mechanism for teleportation. You could see through someone else's eyes and be teleported somewhere else. It was like that was the story we told ourselves. That was the thing that inspired Periscope. And to a certain extent, a lot of people did use the product for that way. You could go see what it was like someplace in the world where it was something amazing happening or civil unrest happening or some important moment happening with breaking news or otherwise.

(01:13:58):
But it turns out the vast majority of our users were not using Periscope that way. It wasn't a rear-facing camera experience where you were showing someone the world, the vast majority of people were using it to just talk to other people. They were bored or they were lonely and they wanted to just have a conversation with other people. And it turns out video and audio is a very interesting way of doing that that allows for more nuance, more long-form conversation, more in-depth conversation, especially in contracts to Twitter, which has mechanics to really incentivize quick, snappy broadcasts that don't lead to much depth. And so when we shut down Periscope, we were like, man, we really need to enable a new form of conversation on Twitter that has some of those properties. And so we had a team that was working on a project that we sort of code named Hydra. Hydra because there were multiple heads on this monster and those heads are participants in a conversation.

(01:14:54):
And so well before Clubhouse was on the map, we had many different iterations of both video and audio only experiences that just didn't feel right, weren't working right, but we felt like we were onto something. And when Clubhouse came on the map, it really re-centered, it put into focus a user experience that felt a lot more right and now give them complete credit for that. Paul and Rohan and that team did an exceptional job crafting an experience that really enabled that mechanic and that premise of enabling these longer form conversations to shine. And so we did shamelessly seek inspiration from what they had done and what had worked and we put our own spin on it. The execution of Spaces within Twitter I think has some similarities, but also really took advantage of the mechanics that you had available to you in Twitter. It's a different product. And so we took the ideas that we felt were shortcuts to making the experience work and then we put our own spin on it. And so I have no problems with what we did there.

(01:15:55):
And having had experienced the pain of not moving quickly enough with Vine from the outside and Periscope having lived that experience, we were not willing to not be the winner with this use case. It is one of the projects I'm most proud of that we worked on at Twitter because we were very radical in our execution. Hydra went from this tiny project that six people were working on that no one knew or care about to, we made Spaces as the number one priority of the company literally above any other project period. And we put a bunch of people on accelerating that product and making it come to life within Twitter. And a lot of that was having felt the pain and burn of fucking this up with Vine and Periscope. And so I'm really proud of our execution. And it was also really energizing. I hope for the company to see that, wow, we pulled that off. So yeah, it was good. It was nice to have that full circle experience and also nice that, personally, I love that aspects of Periscope continue living on within Twitter.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):
I did not know that. That is extremely interesting. Speaking full circle, when I joined Clubhouse the first time, Paul was there introducing me to Clubhouse and exactly the way you described Periscope, so I feel like he drew some inspiration from you one step back.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:17:30):
Paul's amazing. I feel like we're kindred spirits and I could see... It was one of the things I love about that team is just you could just feel how palpable their excitement was and their passion was for what they were building. Another universe we could have worked together more closely, but I think what they built was incredible and we took inspiration from it for sure. Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):
So you've built some of the most successful, most beloved, most used consumer products. You continue to help other founders with their product. I'm curious just if you have any advice for how to get better at building consumer products in terms of maybe craft a product, product sense. What have you learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer product?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:18:19):
The best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products. And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's just no replacement for that. It's such an effective way of honing your own taste and seeing what's superficial but not useful, what's ugly but useful, what's beautiful and useful. And you hone that by having practice and building muscle memory. And so I think there's not a lot of science to it, I think. I mean obviously science can help you become more effective at lots of things. But I feel like I've just always been very curious about trying new things. I'm a very hungry consumer of new things that people are building and I'm not quick to judge. I'll try it even if it seems dumb because sometimes things that seem dumb at the beginning become very meaningful.

(01:19:20):
And so it's always been a very helpful cheat code for me. And it's also just personally interesting. Every tool, even the silly ones, people put their heart and soul into it and it's like an expression of themselves and it's always interesting to see that, to see people's creations and to learn from them and see what you like, what you don't like and how you might create something of your own that borrows from that. So if I could give people any advice through the lens of what's worked for me, it's that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):
Speaking of trying new things, what are you up to these days?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:19:55):
I'm building something in the consumer space. I started the company with a couple of co-founders late last year. We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but hopefully you'll be hearing from us pretty soon. But it's really nice to be back building something again, particularly building something with a small team again after seeing the opposite extreme with a really large company. We've just talked about lots of large company things. But yeah, hopefully you'll be hearing about it soon.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):
Oh man, I think this is breaking news. So mysterious and exciting. Kayvon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:38):
No, no, I think we've covered quite a bit.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):
We have. We have indeed. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:46):
I'm going to take a sip of water and then I'll be ready.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):
Okay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:20:54):
I love reading sci-fi. I just feel like sci-fi and mystery books are so healthy for jogging the imagination. And so some of my favorite books are by Neal Stephenson, I love Cryptonomicon. I love Reamde. I love a book called Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which is more like a fantasy book, but I just love escaping reality and thinking about sci-fi, thinking about fantasy is just, it's helpful for the soul and helpful for the imagination. So those are some of my favorite reads because it helps me. I feel like in some weird circular or wandering way, it helps me be more creative and imaginative. And by the way, that's true outside of reading as well. Some of the content that has shaped me, I feel like and help motivate my curiosity and a lot of things I built is sci-fi TV, right? Star Trek is incredible. We used to use as a metaphor for what Periscope was, we would think about Star Trek. It'd be really cool to be able to teleport or get beamed somewhere else in the world and we're not smart enough to go build that device, but what's the closest approximation to that that we can realize through software? Live streaming. So I think that kind of literature or content has always been inspirational for me and I think getting that through books is really healthy.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):
On that note, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that's inspired you in addition to Star Trek back in the day?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:37):
I mean the most recent movie I saw in theaters was Dune Two, and it was incredible.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):
I just saw that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:22:41):
It's insane. I also thought Oppenheimer was... I'm a huge Nolan fan. Oppenheimer was captivating. To have that level of high octane in a biopic consistently for two and a half hours is so hard to pull off. And I thought it was exceptional. TV shows we're watching Tokyo Vice right now, which I really like. I think one of the best TV shows I've watched recently, I mean Succession was amazing, but maybe I'll pull a less popular one, which is Devs also in the sci-fi realm. I think it was a Hulu show. But if you're interested in tech and AI and you want great acting in Nick Offerman, Devs is a pretty amazing show.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):
I haven't heard of that. Have you seen 3 Body Problem yet, by the way? It feels like it's squarely in your wheelhouse.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:33):
I haven't seen it yet.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Okay.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:35):
And it's funny, some content people are talking about it so much that I kind of want to not watch it now because I feel like it's really hard for shows to live up to the hype when you're mid-hype cycle. So I haven't gone around to it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I know it's the type of show that I would love, but I just haven't gone.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):
Okay, great. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates you're hiring?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:23:58):
The thing that I find is both very illustrative and helpful is just asking people to talk about something they worked on that failed and talk about something they built that succeeded as well. But I think you just learn a lot about self-reflection and their passions. But particularly their self-reflection. If they talk through something that they really cared deeply about that didn't work and why didn't it work? What were the takeaways? What did you learn from it? I think it teaches you about how willing people are to take risks. It tells you have they experienced failure, what they learned from failure. And so I think it's always, you just get to know someone really well. It ends up in a well-rounded understanding of a person, if you can dig into that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):
Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:24:51):
I love Proplexity. It's really interesting to me how Proplexity is a product that fits in your life and replaces a product that is so ingrained in people's behavior, which is using Google search for some set of use cases. And it's just really incredible to me how quickly Proplexity took that over. It is very hard actually to rewire your muscle memory if you're used to using Google for searching for 15, 20 years or whatever. It was just amazing to me how quickly my go-to became Proplexity. And frankly, it's one of the only non-development tool AI products that actually has retained. A lot of people try and consumer AI products that just aren't really, haven't retained. But Proplexity is one that it's a daily driver for me. It's on my home screen and I love it. I'm very impressed by it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):
Also a huge fan.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:25:46):
Yeah. Here's a bias one, my wife is actually working on a startup called Particle, and they're the news experience with AI. And what I love about what they're doing is that for the first time they're like they've rethought what the form factor and the unit of content for news stories should be. Articles are a failed format, is my belief, and certainly their belief. And so they've really come up with an elegant and engaging experience for understanding what's happening in the world in a way that's purely powered by AI. And it's awesome. Again, hashtag biased husband, but it's amazing. It's in beta right now. You can sign up on the wait list. The URL is particlenews.ai. They're letting people in on beta. If you sign up, use coupon code hashtag #KayvonLenny. That's not a real code. But yeah, so that's amazing. So that would be my second pick.

(01:26:48):
I'll give you a non-software one, which is actually a board game that I ran into, that I was gifted actually for my birthday. And it's called Crokinole. Have you heard of this game called Crokinole?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):
I have not.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:01):
So Crokinole is Canadian. I think it's a Canadian board game and it's amazing to me because I've never seen a game be captivating to all age ranges. I love it. I play with my friends. My parents over Christmas were obsessed with this game. My daughter loves. It's a physical game. You flick a puck, like shuffleboard style, but miniaturized with a totally different set of mechanics. And it was just like seeing this game captivate, people of all age ranges was mind-blowing to me and it's really fun. So maybe a curveball answer for you there, but I think those are some of the products that I've been really enjoying and appreciating lately.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):
These are awesome answers. What's the name of that game again? I'm going to-

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:48):
Crokinole.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:53):
Okay. I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):
C-R-O-K-I-N-O-L-E.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:59):
Great. I love the K in there. That makes it really fun. And by the way, I think it's also Particle.news looking at it. It's so cool. It's basically bullet points of news items and then it links to all the articles that have written about it. So it just summarizes, here's the things you need to know and it's beautiful.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:13):
Yeah, basically they consume and aggregate everything that's happening in the world by among other things, ingesting articles and then crafting these story modules through them that are summarized by AI. And then they let you actually interrogate the news and ask questions. So leveraging LLMs and tool calls, it's able to actually help you understand what's happening in the world. And they also are building a social layer as well. So it was very cool. I'll definitely get you in the beta.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):
This is actually amazing timing, because I was a huge fan of Artifact, the news app, and they're going away, so this is the next news app, so thanks for sharing that. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with people that you find useful in work or in life?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:28:57):
Something that definitely shaped my work ethic and how I work that came from my first boss actually. When I was 14, I had a summer job basically replacing and doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. So I would drive into San Francisco, my boss would pick me up in his truck, we'd go to big commercial buildings, hospitals, high rises, and we would take all the fire extinguishers in the building, hundreds of them to the garage, empty them, fill them, tag them, inspect them. And that was my first job. And I don't even remember if I was getting paid. I was probably getting paid very small amount, but it was just first work experience. And I remember there was this moment that I had finished dealing with my extinguishers and I was just sitting in his truck twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. And my boss came up to me and was like, when you've got nothing to do, sweep never sit around.

(01:29:57):
And it was so funny, it was just very tiny moment, but I've never ever forgotten that. When you got nothing to do sweep. And it had such a profound impact on my work ethic of there's always something you can be doing to move the ball forward and being productive and being impactful. And I'm so grateful that Fred, my boss, had that moment with me. It was like, I don't even think he understands how impactful that was, but it felt so much a life motto, but it definitely stuck with me and shaped how I work.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:30:35):
I love that you shared that story. I found that quote and story in GQ Magazine turns out is where you talked about this and I was going to ask about it and I didn't and I'm glad you shared it because I love it.

(01:30:47):
Final question, we're going to go full circle. Scott Belsky, you're friends with him. What's something people would be surprised about or don't know about Scott, that might be interesting?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:30:58):
Well, I'll tell you one funny story and then I'll first tell you something I love about Scott. Scott is a great example of someone who I think has driven immense cultural change at a massive, legendary company in Adobe obviously. But the number of transformations that Scott oversaw and led and contributed to at Adobe are incredible. And I'm sure having a fraction of this experience at Twitter, I can appreciate how difficult and challenging and rewarding that was, right? Going from package software to cloud, going from non-AI to AI, going from discrete tools to an integrated suite that worked really elegantly together. I think Scott oversaw a lot of this stuff and it's pretty incredible to see that transformation have been so successful at Adobe. So I love that.

(01:31:55):
I guess a funny story about Scott that people might not know, I consider him to have been the first Periscoper. So Scott believed in Periscope before it was Periscope, before we had turned it into live video, we had a previous version of our beta that was static photo sharing, same vision, same concept, but the product was called Bounty. And it was like you put a pin somewhere in the world like the Tokyo fish market and someone would respond with a photo of what it looked like there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:32:25):
I didn't know that.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:32:26):
Our vision was still to help you see through someone else's eyes, but the first manifestation was really static and had this marketplace dynamic, and it took us a while to get to the point where we were like, press a button, go live and have it be live video because by definition it's real time rather than static.

(01:32:42):
Anyways, before we built any of that, when we were playing with the idea and Scott was encouraging us to go in this direction, I remember probably the second time I ever met Scott, we did it FaceTime and he was at the TED conference, I want to say it was in Vancouver, and just to illustrate how cool it would be when he accepted the FaceTime and he's like, "Cool, and I'm going to take you on a Periscope." And he flipped this camera and started walking around the TED conference and basically pretending like he was prototyping the product, but using FaceTime. And it was such an amazing experience because having an investor essentially encourage you down a product direction by showing rather than telling, it was such a great encapsulation of how supportive Scott was and inspiring Scott was as one of our cheerleaders. And I respect him so much for everything he did to help Periscope make happen, and also for betting on us, because he was one of the first people who said yes to investing. He didn't know us, he just believed in us. And that helped everything else come together. And yeah, he's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:33:48):
What a mensch.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):
We've got to get him back on the podcast. The story reminds me of your Elon's story, where he FaceTimed you, and it also makes me think about your lesson of building consumer products, just using it, being obsessed with it, Scott, just like, here's what it could look like. And actually using the product, not just talking about.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:04):
Yeah, he's a great example of that as well. He's definitely a gracious user of all tools and products, and that's why he has really great, really great product sense.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):
Kayvon, you're amazing. This was so freaking fascinating. There's so many nuggets here. Can't wait for folks to hear this.

(01:34:20):
Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and maybe follow up on anything if there's things you want to follow up on potentially? And then, how can listeners be useful to you?

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:30):
People can find me on Twitter/X/whatever we're calling it these days. My handle is @kayvz, K-A-Y-V-Z. And yeah, if you're of this podcast and you're working on something cool and you need some help or advice or you're looking for an angel investor, don't hesitate to reach out and would love to try what you're building.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:51):
Amazing. And also check out Particle.news.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:53):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:54):
Support the wife.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:55):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:34:56):
Amazing. All right, Kayvon, thank you so much for being here.

Kayvon Beykpour (01:34:59):

# Taxi mafias, cash vaults & 100% MoM growth: The story of SEA’s biggest startup | Kevin Aluwi (Gojek)

## Transcript

Kevin Aluwi (00:00:00):
In the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services. The most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them, and I think it would've been easy for us to say like, "Hey, they're all contractors. They're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out." But instead, we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help our drivers in those situations, to help kind of extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time.

Lenny (00:01:16):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Kevin Aluwi. Kevin is the co-founder and former CEO of a company called Gojek, which I've always been fascinated by. You may recall a former guest Crystal Widjaja, who was head of growth at Gojek, and I've always wanted to get more of the story. Gojek is infamous for their scrappiness, their unique approach to ops and growth, and as being one of the first and most successful super apps in the world. They've also long been maybe the biggest startup in Indonesia and all of Southeast Asia. Kevin and the story of Gojek have a lot to teach founders in the US and all over the world, and so I was really excited to sit down with Kevin to dig into the story, he did not disappoint.

(00:02:04):
You'll hear all kinds of wild stories about them having to hire a private security team to protect their drivers, having to build their own cash distribution centers to pay their drivers, plus how they won in large part thanks to their early investment in brand, why it's important to do the hard things as a startup. Also, why super apps are surprisingly overrated and much more. Enjoy this episode with Kevin Aluwi after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:02:29):
This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient? I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.

(00:03:07):
If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars startup credit on your first statement. That's coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.

(00:03:45):
This episode is brought to you by rows.com, the world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share.

(00:04:20):
If you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce or HubSpot directly into Rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables and calculators into Notion, Confluence or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rose. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.

(00:05:01):
Kevin, welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Aluwi (00:05:03):
Thank you. Thanks for having me, Lenny. We've finally made it happen after a few weeks or months of going back and forth.

Lenny (00:05:10):
Yeah, I'm really excited to finally meet you and to dig into a bunch of stuff. I think this is going to be a really unique episode. I don't often have founders on the podcast, especially founders of companies that are not based in the US. In this case, Indonesia, Crystal Widjaja, who is on this podcast previously. One of my favorite guests is just like "Lenny, you got to get Kevin on your podcast." And so here we are.

Kevin Aluwi (00:05:32):
I'm glad to be in a small group of category of people that you invite. Thank you. I'm a huge fan of what you do.

Lenny (00:05:38):
Thanks, man, I really appreciate that. And just redirect to you, you are the co-founder of a company called Gojek. Many people listening have never heard of Gojek, especially people in the US. So just to start, can you just describe what is Gojek, what do y'all do? And then also I think more interestingly is just the scale of I think people in the US, their mind will blow once they hear the scale you've reached with this company. They probably hadn't heard of it.

Kevin Aluwi (00:06:03):
So Gojek started as a motorcycle taxi based service. So it's a kind of uniquely Indonesian things where we have millions of motorcycle taxi drivers in all of the urban centers in Indonesia. And so we started with a very local problem and the first product was a on-demand super app, if you will, where you could ask someone on a motorcycle to give you a ride, send a package for you or buy something and deliver it to you. This then evolved over the years into a more general on demand consumer super app that also included car drivers and other services ranging from the ones mentioned to grocery deliveries and payments and financial services.

(00:06:52):
And today we took the company public about a year and a half ago after we merged with Indonesia's top e-commerce platform. And we've managed to also expand outside of just Indonesia, where today we have about 2.7 million drivers across Southeast Asia. We've completed about 3 billion orders last year, so that's 3 billion orders. So the scale of our region is often under underappreciated, where we also have about 15 million merchants doing general e-commerce, but also restaurants on our food delivery service. And on that IPO, we're pretty proud to say that it was Indonesia's largest IPO of all time, where we raised over a billion dollars at something like 27, 28 billion dollars in terms of valuation.

Lenny (00:07:50):
And these numbers you shared 2.7 million drivers, 30 billion orders,

Kevin Aluwi (00:07:55):
3 billion.

Lenny (00:07:57):
3 billion. How would that compare to an Uber or Lyft?

Kevin Aluwi (00:07:58):
I don't know what their latest numbers are, but just in terms of the numbers of people and the number of activity, I would place our scale among the largest US companies.

Lenny (00:08:10):
That's pretty wild that there's this company out there that a lot of people didn't know about that is basically of the scale of Uber and Lyft.

Kevin Aluwi (00:08:17):
In terms of volume, I would say that we're up there with Uber globally and definitely larger than Lyft. I don't remember how many drivers are in the US, but we definitely have more drivers in the region than all of America.

Lenny (00:08:35):
Just to kind of check this check box, you said it was a super app. What are all the things that Gojek does? Just whatever you want to share, all the things that you can do.

Kevin Aluwi (00:08:43):
From the point when we had the most services, we had everything from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery deliveries. We had moving services on trucks and vans. We had on demand massages, cleaning services. You could get your hair done on Gojek, you could order movie tickets, you could get a loan, you could pay for things. I think at our peak we had something like near 30 different services all in one app.

Lenny (00:09:18):
I think it's like you're officially a super app if your founder can't even remember all the things that you do right now.

Kevin Aluwi (00:09:25):
Yeah, definitely. I would challenge anyone within the company to be able to name all of our services that we've ever had on the app because it was pretty wild at one point. And I'd love to talk a little bit about my thoughts on super apps at some point during the session because I definitely have some mixed views over it as a product strategy as we've gone through that whole cycle.

Lenny (00:09:54):
It might be actually a good time just to jump into it. I know that I was actually saving that for later, but this might be a good time. And part of the reason I think this is really interesting is if you open up Uber these days, it's like 40 things that they're offering now. Elon at Twitter is talking about turning Twitter into a super app like payments, communication, messaging, all these things. So I think it's a really interesting trend that continues to pop up here in the US and I would absolutely love to hear your perspective on super apps.

Kevin Aluwi (00:10:19):
Okay, I'm going to come off a little strong on this, but I am kind of annoyed at how much it's being mentioned these days. It's really popular in VC-consultant-analyst circles because it sounds really great on a strategy deck because all of the things that are really appealing, we'll talk about lower customer acquisition costs, higher attach rates to different products, talk about higher retention across different services, the ease of cross-selling and upselling. All of these things sound great, but in reality, a lot of those benefits don't pan out. And one probably really good example that I like to reference is that I remember one of our products was mobile phone top up and recharge. In Southeast Asia, a majority of people are on prepaid plans instead of postpaid plans. So everyone basically buys their minutes and their data plans upfront in the beginning of the week or the beginning of the month.

(00:11:27):
So we had a product which was a mobile top-up product. And so the reason I mentioned this specific product as a really illustrative point on super apps is that it's a product that 95% plus of our customers need because they're all on prepaid plans. So it's a very relevant product. And we had our UX research research team actually look into why the engagement in the product wasn't as high as we thought it should be. So one of the questions that our URX team asked our customers was like, "Hey, do you know that you could top up your mobile minutes and by data on the Gojek app?" And only about 40% of our customers, like 30 or 40% of our customers knew that this product existed. And that completely blew our minds because one, it's a product that is relevant for all of our customers.

(00:12:25):
Two, it was literally there on one of the six buttons on the homepage. And I think the insight that we got here was that there kind of needs to be a unifying concept across all of your services within the app for your users to be able to think about your product in a sensible way. And for us, the way that our customers thought about us was that they thought about the driver. And so when we went from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery delivery, customers really understood that. And we didn't have to sell this idea to our customers that you had all of these services under one app because they thought about the Gojek driver. That made sense. You can easily cross sell somebody from a ride hailing customer to a grocery customer or a food delivery customer because they understood the unifying factor there being the driver.

(00:13:24):
But then when you start doing other things that don't have that unifying factor in terms of the concept that a customer has when they think about your service, it starts breaking down. So one other fun UXR insight here was when we launched massage services. So we had at one point though we've shut it down a few years after, we had massage services where you can order a masseuse to come to your place. And a question that many of our customers asked was that, "oh, is the driver going to come into my house and give me a massage?" And for us, that was insane. Of course not, our drivers are not trained masseuses, but that was the question that people asked because they thought like, "oh, this app is an app for these driver related services, so if there was a massage service, I'm assuming it's that same man who's going to give me a massage."

(00:14:17):
And so I think this kind of illustrates the importance of having these unifying concepts that are easy for customers to think about the multiple different services. It's not as simple as just saying, oh, we have a lot of engagement, we have a lot of eyeballs at a service. And then you have a super app that makes sense for customers. And so that whole nirvana of lower CAC, higher retention that are all on these great strategy decks often don't pan out because you kind of have to then resell this idea of like, oh, this is another service and that you can use. And that's a bit of investment that you have to actually put in terms of advertising and customer education that increases those customer acquisition costs.

(00:15:03):
And it also leads to design constraints because there's only so many ways you can display a whole bunch of different services that actually have little to do with each other, which is why when you see super apps today, it's kind of like this giant menu or this giant grid which does limit the design decisions that you can make, which is unfortunate because if you actually, I think it's an unsolved problem at this point.

Lenny (00:15:28):
It's hilarious story about the massage product. Sounds like a lot of startups are going to have some issues scaling to new products and trying to become a super app. I want to shift a little bit and talk about brand. I did a little research on you ahead of this chat. I watched your Marshall graduation and speech and a few other interviews you did, and something that came out of your previous writing and talks is just how much you care about brand and how much value you put into brand. And that you just have a lot of opinions about the importance of brand. And to me and to most people, brand is this really squishy thing and it's hard to know what exactly to do to build your brand, when to prioritize it, how to prioritize it amongst other things you're doing, especially early on. So I'd love to hear your advice for founders that are listening and just like, what should I actually do around brand? What's your advice for how to tactically do something about brand and also just why do you think it's so important?

Kevin Aluwi (00:16:23):
I do agree with you that it is kind of this squishy thing that most people see as an afterthought, may be because it is kind of this squishy thing that it's hard to define, but I'm a very big believer that the two most important things in a consumer business are product and brand in that order. And I don't think I need to sell the idea, especially to your audience. That product is absolutely critical and probably the most important. But brand as an afterthought is definitely one of the areas where I think there's a giant missed opportunity for consumer tech businesses. And I get why we opened the session by talking about the size of the business to get an appreciation of the scale for audience members who might be unfamiliar with us or with the region.

(00:17:16):
But I wish I did have to start there because we actually started as a very scrappy company where we were by far the underfunded player and without brand. We probably would've never gotten to escape velocity beyond that scrappy stage, we've maintained our leadership in Indonesia through a lot of the things that we actually did on the brand side to give you a sense of how scrappy we had to be in competition.

(00:17:52):
For the first six months after launching our app, we had only raised about $2 million and our regional competitor had already raised 250. So they had literally more than a hundred times more capital than we have. So it's easy to talk about what we built as this kind of giant business, but we came from a place where we were seriously underfunded. And I think a big reason why we survived was that we built a great brand for our consumers and for our drivers and for our merchants. And I think that great brands create associations in their customer's minds that transcend the typically transactional or utilitarian one that most people have with businesses and they become part of one's identity.

(00:18:42):
I think some of the best-in-class examples of these are probably all the Apple fanboys and fangirls, Nike sneakerheads, for these individuals, the brand becomes a really big part of their identity and their loyalty towards the products of the company go beyond a relationship that can easily be swayed just through discounts or other more features that other competitors might have. And so I'm a really firm believer of how important this is because you can see it if you step out of the tech bubble for a second, you can see that there's so many great companies out there that really rely on the strength of their brand to build these fantastic businesses and to create great experiences for their customers. And you ask, what are the things that one can do?

(00:19:45):
I think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product and with your business. So having that consistency across all customer touchpoints is really important. So how you write copy and advertising and in the app, how you've even designed the app, but we were the first company of scale to have ads that don't take ourselves too seriously. We make fun of ourselves, we make fun of our cultural observations of Indonesia. And again, to just build this overall field that like, Hey, we get, we are part of the overall culture of Indonesia. And I think even going beyond the more aesthetic or communication oriented investments, we also leaned into cultural artifacts in our product features to really build this brand that is part of day-to-day culture.

(00:21:09):
One of my favorite cultural artifacts is that in Asia it's fairly common to send food as gifts to your loved ones or maybe people you're interested in dating. So people would send over food as gifts to their romantic interests. And so when we launched our food delivery service, a lot of people were actually using it for this, I'm going to send it to my boyfriend or my girlfriend or the person that I'm interested in dating. And so it became this whole cultural phenomenon of sending go-food for these people and we kind of lean into it in our product feature where all of the other players in the market at the time basically only allowed you to deliver food to your home or your office, but we actually created a feature that allowed you to choose a delivery point that was far away from where you were.

(00:22:04):
There was a lot of reasons why other companies didn't allow it at the time because it's like, oh, it might be used for fraud and stuff like that. But we leaned into it, we leaned into it and actually created features that allowed to put your pickup point far away from where your actual location was. And then we just had fun with this whole idea of go-food dating. And so yes, it's kind of part of branding, but thinking about branding beyond just marketing communication but actually be as being relatable and being part of the culture and being sensitive of what that culture is, I think was something that we did really well in the early days that allowed us to continue maintaining leadership in spite of the fact that our competitors had more money, which meant that they could offer more discounts, they could offer more incentives to drivers, but we really kind of lean very hard into being not just a utilitarian commodity, which is what a lot of people would say is the nature of our business to some level of accuracy.

Lenny (00:23:08):
So just to get even more concrete, one takeaway from what you just shared, which is interesting, is the first part of figuring out how to approach your brand is what's the personality of your product for you? You said it was like we're just of the people, we're like you, we're here to help you, make your life easier. And then that informs the copy, the messaging, be a little, I forget how you describe it, but just almost bad grammar and stuff just because it relates more to people and then some of these product launches that connect to that. So maybe if there's anything else you want to add there that'd be interesting. And then what's like, I don't know, one or two moments that most helped build the brand. I know you're kind of famous for having helmets and jackets on the drivers that help spread the Gojek brand. Is there anything else that just like, wow, this was really effective to build this brand that ended up dominating Indonesia?

Kevin Aluwi (00:23:58):
The jackets and helmets piece I think is really, really important for two reasons. One, the more obvious reason, which is that because they were just all over the streets of many cities in Indonesia, people were familiar with the imagery and the names, but I think it's also really important that people saw what was happening. So if we were like, I don't know, an airline and we branded a bunch of people on the streets with our brand, yeah, sure, that might help with brand recall and people might know about the name. But what was really powerful was that when people would be seeing these drivers with their jackets and helmets, they would be seeing passengers on the backseat as they were stuck in traffic. So I'm stuck in traffic and I'm seeing these people whiz past me with with this imagery on them, and immediately I get that association like, oh, I'm stuck in traffic, but I could be out there cutting through traffic on a motorcycle or you see them carrying packages or delivering food, and you immediately get like, oh, these are guys who can deliver food or deliver packages for me.

(00:25:14):
And so it was like this beautiful combination of one just having that imagery and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand. But more importantly, it was also a physical reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you. And so looking for these opportunities where again, customers can make that connection between the logo and the colors and the name with actually what the service is, I think are the opportunities that I would say people should look out for. They're admittedly quite rare, which is why in my opinion, the laziest kind of branding tends to be the most popular. Just put your name and your copy on a billboard or on a CPM or CPC campaign. But there are these opportunities I think, on being able to reinforce the value proposition of your business in a way that is beyond just visual recall. And I think that was why that specific anecdote is something I like to talk about because it was really one of those special things that reminded people on why we're here.

Lenny (00:26:37):
Yeah, I think you tweeted that it was one of the most important things you ever did as a company is decide to put these logos on the helmets and jackets. Reminds me of Lyft's pink mustache, which went away, but felt like a really important way for them to differentiate.

Kevin Aluwi (00:26:51):
No, totally.

Lenny (00:26:53):
You talked about how scrappy you've been, and I want to dig into that a little bit more. I think there's like US startup scrappy, and then there's like Gojek scrappy, and it'd be fun to hear maybe a story or two just to illustrate how ridiculously scrappy you were as a company early on, especially.

Kevin Aluwi (00:27:11):
One thing that we did in the early days that was absolutely crazy was that we were one of the pioneering companies, one of the pioneering technology companies in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. And so we came into a environment where a lot of the things that maybe companies or people in more developed economies take for granted, for example, having electronic or digital payments, that was something that actually didn't really exist that much when we first started. And so we had a problem of actually trying to pay drivers because drivers every day we would be paying out incentives or just having customers pay with their credit cards or their store balance, and then we'd have a challenge and getting our drivers to actually be able to take that money out for their earnings. And in the early days, we actually had cash booths. So we actually had physical spaces with a vault and cash sitting in the vault where drivers can show up that, oh, this is my driver ID and this is the balance that I have with you. Please give me the cash.

(00:28:31):
And so we would have these actual physical locations where there would be lions of drivers essentially taking cash. And we eventually figured this out of like, okay, we'll work with a bank and integrate with an ATM network and all that. But in the early days we just did it ourselves of building essentially a mini at ATM network, which I think even that sounds too fancy of what it was it. Because it was literally a booth with a vault with cash in it. And we had at the time already tens of thousands of drivers all across in Indonesia.

(00:29:10):
Another scrappy story that actually Crystal reminded me of recently that we did was at the time there was a lot of fake driver apps out there because we didn't have all of the security investments that we eventually made, things like code obfuscation and better API security that wouldn't allow for these fraudulent driver apps, these basically third party driver apps to connect to our platform. So there were a lot of these drivers using these third party driver apps that were doing things that... So they were kind of doing unsavory things like stealing driver details, some of them even as bad as financial details so that they can then at some point drain driver funds. And the way that they did it, the way that they convinced drivers to actually use these apps was that they actually added some features that at the time we didn't allow. So things like we wanted drivers to be conscious of what was happening on the app, and so we would actually make sure that drivers would push the accept order button.

(00:30:28):
We made sure that that was the only way that drivers could accept orders, but this app had a functionality that would automatically accept orders as soon as they came in. And so actually it was kind of this interesting situation where they were doing things that were fraudulent and were not safe for the integrity of the platform, but at the same time they were also providing some value to the people who were using them. And so at the time we had to make a decision of like, okay, we need to nip this in the bud and one way that we could have done it, that would've taken time was it really invest in a lot of the technical security aspects of it, but we didn't have the bandwidth to be able to do that. Engineering and security talent is actually super scarce in Southeast Asia at the time, still is today, but at that time extremely scarce.

(00:31:25):
And so we ended up making the decision of actually copying those features. So we actually saw all of these third party fraudulent apps and instead of building a whole system to prevent them from being built or preventing them from working on the platform, we just said, "Hey, let's take their top two or three features and let's build them into our app." And that actually significantly reduced the number of users on these third party apps just by having this mentality of you can't beat them, then join them. And that I would say that wasn't a philosophical decision or a principal decision. Is was actually a decision made out of necessity because we simply couldn't build all the capability to combat these apps at the time?

These are hilarious stories that you had to compete with these ripoff jail broken apps, fraudulent apps, and then you had to build a cash box network all over the country. That's amazing. I knew there would be good stories in this question and I'm glad you delivered. There's also this feeling of within Gojek of just doing the hard thing and you just shared a couple stories of this versus the simple... A lot of startups are like, let's do the simplest thing, feels like you guys lean into the hard thing. Why is that? Where'd that come from? And then is there any other story of something that you did that was like, we'll do it the hard way?

Kevin Aluwi (00:33:41):
I really don't like the idea of moats. Again, one of the concepts that gets thrown out a lot by strategy type folks of what's the moat of your business or your product? And usually people are looking for an answer like, oh, look at this capability or look at this feature or look at this distribution partner or all of those kind of things. And I don't believe that any moats are durable over time. Eventually with enough time all moats can be crossed. And I think one so-called moat that doesn't get talked about enough is the fact that you're able to do hard things because hard things are hard and just simply doing things that are hard, as long as they create value to your customers, actually is a position that makes it harder for your competitors to be able to win over your customers because it's hard to do those things.

(00:34:52):
And probably another example of doing something that sounds very difficult was that in the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services and one of the forms of that resistance, one of the more most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them to just physical altercations, literally mobs of people getting into these brawls. And there was a lot of these kind of things that actually happened in the streets of Jakarta at the time. And I think it would've been easy for us to say, "Hey, they're all contractors, they're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out."

(00:36:14):
But instead we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help these situations, to help our drivers in those situations, to help extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time until it became common to have Gojek drivers do all of these things across cities. We actually ran this very operation intensive thing just to make sure that our drivers could be as safe as possible and it showed our commitment to the driver community, it showed our commitment that we cared. And again, going back to that earlier point around having that branding association, drivers knew that, hey, we weren't just a platform that didn't care. We actually cared about their safety and that helped build that goodwill even as competitors started coming in and paying more money, we still had a lot of loyalty within the driver community because of things like that.

Lenny (00:37:30):
How did you actually have a security person on a motorcycle? Were they pretending to be the rider and then just get out and punch them in the face?

Kevin Aluwi (00:37:39):
A minority of situations were like that, but a lot of that was just like, having an on-call service where they could just dial a number and somebody within a 5-10 minute distance would actually show up. And so we would have these patrols effectively in specific hotspots where if there was a situation brewing that they would instantly or almost instantly show up to the site and help diffuse it.

Lenny (00:38:13):
I love that you have this super app that's doing all these things for people. Plus within the company you've built all these mini businesses, like a whole bank to pay people, private security company. There's probably some other... Crystal shared a story of you guys rented out a stadium for drivers to collect all the drivers and give them phones.

Kevin Aluwi (00:38:33):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:38:34):
Okay. This is great.

Kevin Aluwi (00:38:34):
Yeah, that I think is probably one of the hallmarks of this region in general where I have no doubt that what we were building and what we are today is a technology company, but I do think that in the early days you do have to be a lot more operations heavy. And then I think that lends to that scrappiness because there are a lot of things that to solve elegantly and technically will take a lot of time and just kind of over focusing on those type of solutions I think would be doing your customers a disservice because there are opportunities to make things a lot better just through probably more innovation in operations to kind of kickstart things until you have the more elegant, scalable, technical or product solution.

Lenny (00:39:38):
That reminds me that at Gojek, you held tons of different roles throughout the time you were there. You were obviously co-founder, your Co-CEO at one point, defacto CPO at one point, CIO, CFO. I heard that you were writing like push notification copy, became a driver at one point just to keep things running. So feels like another good example of exactly what you're talking about of just doing the hard thing in the operational component.

Kevin Aluwi (00:40:05):
I mean, yes, actually I did have a stint as an amateur performance marketer in the early days of Gojek. I would write copy, I would upload ads onto Facebook and Google and try and do my best in optimizing our online marketing spend. But I think I did all of those things, not because I wanted to be scrappy necessarily, but I do think that as, and this is probably most relevant for founders, less for executives, but I think as a founder, I do think it's really important to understand the work that needs to be done in order to see what excellence looks like. And for us, again, we came from an ecosystem where the availability of experienced talent was relatively low. And so for me it was very hard to be able to say, "oh, let's hire person X from organization Y with job description Z," and we know that they probably can deliver because again, the talent availability was really low.

(00:41:16):
And so a lot of times I felt like I needed to understand, okay, what is this job? What exactly does it entail is, and seeing how bad I am at it allowed me to understand what good looked like. And so I held a lot of those roles just because I wanted to understand every part of the business as best as I could in order to then find somebody who could do it orders of magnitude better than myself. I would say that is true for all of these roles except for being a driver. I think being a driver, I wasn't trying to understand what excellence as a driver look like. Obviously the drivers do a really challenging job and I think I just wanted to understand what that role was like to build a lot more empathy towards the job and make sure that our product was catered towards what those needs were.

(00:42:12):
So when we first launched our car ride hailing services, I think I was the first actual driver on the app and I would every now and then be a driver. And I remember the early days when I actually picked up a customer. It was this lady and she put in her destination as a mall. And so I went to this house and I knew that, okay, I needed to drive to this mall, but then this lady comes out with this giant bag and so I had to hop out the car, take this giant bag, put it in my trunk, and then off we went. And in the middle of the drive she's like, "Hey, I need to drop off and do my laundry on the way to the mall." And I just had to, "okay, cool." We took a detour, I lugged this giant bag out of our trunk and helped this lady do her laundry.

(00:43:17):
And then we went to the mall and I got very little money out of that experience and it wasn't instant, but this is eventually what led to, I think a lot of the support I gave to our driver teams when they were pushing for, Hey, we need more waiting fees, we need to add multiple stops in order to make sure that hey, a lot of this extra work was actually compensated. And it was something that I obviously experienced personally and it was something that I definitely was excited about as a set of product features and principles when it came to building our driver app.

Lenny (00:43:58):
It feels like having to do that ends up being a feature as you said, that you actually experienced a lot of these challenges and you said the really good point about knowing what to hire and what these people are going to actually do.

Kevin Aluwi (00:44:07):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:44:07):
That's interesting how that often turns into a good thing. I know you also have a pretty interesting journey into tech. What can you share around that?

Kevin Aluwi (00:44:18):
So I am basically a failed finance professional. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life. And in 2005, which is when I entered college, the hot sexy thing to do was finance. And I guess that was what I wanted to do. And I went, studied finance, and then the crash of 2008 happened and I graduated 2009, so it's probably the worst time to try and be a finance professional. And so I went through a really challenging time there, but eventually I got a job at a boutique investment banking firm. And that was, I thought like, okay, now I was set for life. I got the job that I wanted. I'm working in finance. But then long story short, I was not very good. I was not very good. My bosses thought I was underperforming. I didn't feel like I was performing, and I kind of left that field that I thought I built my entire, I guess future dreams and identity around.

(00:45:32):
And after I did that, I decided to take a bet in Indonesian technology because when all of this was happening was around 2010, 2011, and it was starting to see the development of the current technology giants in the US at the time. And I thought that it would be pretty cool if Indonesia ever had a technology industry to be part of it at the ground floor. And so I moved back in 2011 and it was super early. It was really early at the time where the level of talent, the level of funding, the level of product market fit, the number of people who transacted on the internet was also still super low. People still saw the internet as a place for chat apps and social media. And so the level of belief that people had in the space at that time was pretty low.

(00:46:30):
People didn't think that real businesses and real valuable products could be built, especially be built locally. And so taking that bet was something that I think it really panned out for us to be really early in the space, which today has become very vibrant to the scene. Southeast Asia has become, I think one of the most exciting spaces in technology in the world to date. But at the time it wasn't obvious. And being able to see that development I think was something that was really important to me because it really shows you what's possible in a very short time. And I think it's something that probably people in technology in the US can relate to, the people who've been working in this space for like 20, 30 years. But being able to see those early days for me was just really valuable and I think was an experience that I definitely cherish.

Lenny (00:47:31):
It's really hard to just build a company outside of Silicon Valley, and it was even harder back then. COVID and remote work almost made it the easiest it's ever been.

Kevin Aluwi (00:47:40):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:47:40):
Sounds like a lot of the fact that you were so far away from the Bay Area informed the way that you built this company, the scrappiness that you talked about. I'm curious if you have any advice for a founder who's trying to build a company now outside of, say the Bay Area or just US in general based on your experience.

Kevin Aluwi (00:47:58):
Yeah, look, it was super hard back then. It was particularly hard because Indonesia is such a valuable market, Indonesia and the rest, I would say primarily Indonesia just because of its scale. But I think overall Southeast Asia was just such a valuable market and it was interesting for global companies to want to win it. So we competed with global and regional companies, but the local talent and funding ecosystems were really underdeveloped. So that challenge of having to compete with the best in the world for customers in the market while also not having all of the resources available within the market to be able to build products and companies that can compete was I would say one of the most challenging parts of building probably in markets that are atypical or outside of Silicon Valley and maybe some of the other technology centers in the world like China and India.

(00:49:01):
So some of my learnings probably there that I would take going forward is I think we talked a lot about being scrappy. In the beginning, we were a lot more ops-heavy than tech-heavy. And doing the things that don't scale through other means I think is definitely something that is absolutely necessary if you're building outside of these main technology hubs. Another thing I would say is you need to get good at remote work really early. And I think today that's kind of become a lot more prevalent as more and more people have experience with remote work. For us, we built an engineering center in Bangalore in 2015, and this allowed us to compete a lot better with the global giants because we had access to a really deep talent market in India at the time, but we were really early in this whole remote work thing because it wasn't common for people in our region, but also globally to have so much talent concentration outside of headquarters.

(00:50:14):
And I do believe that companies who want to compete against world class competitors outside of these technology centers like Silicon Valley need to become good at remote work really fast because getting that talent probably means having offices or individuals who are outside of your home market or your headquarters. And probably the final I would say tip here is don't just copy, because Gojek was not an Uber clone, even though that was kind of how some investors or analysts talk about us, we were focused on a solution that was uniquely an Indonesian phenomenon, the motorcycle taxi driver. And this led to both product and branding innovation. On the product side, we were an on-demand super app because we saw that a human being on a motorcycle could do a lot of things. And so we built a product around that idea and hence we ended up with a super app even before super apps were really a thing.

(00:51:24):
And then that branding point that we talked about a little earlier about giving our drivers jackets and helmets so people could see them zip around town, which actually doesn't make sense if you're a car ride hailing service because it's not very easy to brand a car and the drivers are inside the car. But all of our competitors at the time when they first entered the motorcycle ride hailing space didn't brand their drivers because they came from a car-centric view. And so again, understanding your unique market dynamics is also really important if you're building outside of these technology centers.

Lenny (00:52:10):
We've been chatting about Indonesia and Southeast Asia. I'd love to hear just what should people know about that market? We've chatted about what you guys have built and a few other companies here and there, but what companies should people be aware of what's happening? What's the latest, what's exciting?

Kevin Aluwi (00:52:24):
Yeah, I think specifically Indonesia, most people don't know that Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world and that Southeast Asia holds almost 10% of the world's population. But beyond the macro picture, I think also we've experienced a pretty unique level of pace of adoption for products with great product market fit. So products with great product market fit grow tremendously fast in this part of the world. And in 2015, for example, when we launched our app, we grew more than a hundred percent month on month for the first 16, 18 months. So we more than doubled every month for more than a year.

Lenny (00:53:16):
That is insane. I've never heard of that.

Kevin Aluwi (00:53:19):
No, and our investors at the time, Sequoia is one of our investors at the time, told us that this was the craziest growth story that they've ever heard of in the world. And I wouldn't say because of our necessarily our brilliance, it was a combination of how in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia, there are a lot of these things that are obviously broken and could be improved with better technology and better products. But we also have in this region a very young population who are excited to try new things. And so if you find a solution that really resonates with a lot of these common day-to-day problems, the adoption curve is just absolutely insane. And I think it's one of the things that are definitely unique to developing regions like this one.

(00:54:14):
One company that's really interesting for example, just to give a flavor of the type of seemingly off the wall product or company being built in this part of the world, there's a company called eFishery, and what they do is they basically create a closed loop ecosystem for fish farmers in currently, I think they're only operational Indonesia or they're recently expanding beyond Indonesia.

(00:54:45):
They help farmers feed their fish through this IOT smart device that helps measure the amount of fish feed that needs to go into the ponds, but they also then help farmers do things that get financing and also sell their produce out to local or even regional or global markets. And it's a company doing something like a quarter billion dollars in revenue and it's profitable and it's basically a fish farmer, a close loop ecosystem. And it's pretty wild that something like this exists, but it does speak to, I think again earlier what I said earlier about the hunger that the population have for better solutions. And if you can find these better solutions, you can really build companies of the very meaningful scale very, very quickly.

Lenny (00:55:42):
So at this point, you've stepped down a CEO, you've stepped down from the board, what's next and how does it feel?

Kevin Aluwi (00:55:50):
Yeah, I'm still on this journey honestly, of how does it feel. I think that building Gojek is by far the most important professional experience and frankly, one of the most important life experiences I've had. It's made me a way better person actually. And now that I've stepped away, I am not as bored or as aimless as people would expect after having such a kind of all-consuming thing be part of my life experience.

(00:56:37):
What's next? Honestly, Lenny, I don't know. I don't have a plan at this stage. I do some angel investing on the side. I work with other founders to be able to maybe just share some of these experiences that I shared today and just figuring out what makes me happy and what are the kind activities that I find rewarding. I don't know, maybe I'll start another company at some point. I think that's my default, but I think right now I'm just taking things easy and trying to figure out another problem I guess, that I could be obsessed about.

Lenny (00:57:25):
You've earned that time to explore and look for new problems. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:33):
No Lenny. I think we've covered a lot today, and I just wanted to thank you for the time.

Lenny (00:57:41):
Amazing. It's absolutely my pleasure. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:48):
Yes, let's go.

Lenny (00:57:50):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kevin Aluwi (00:57:54):
What You Do Is Who You Are. I think that was the second most popular Ben Horowitz's book, but I'm really obsessed with building interesting and engaging cultures, so I think that's one. Another is a classic marketing book. Again, we talked a lot about branding today, so there's this book called How Brands Grow by Byron Sharp. I don't agree necessarily with everything in it, but I do think that it's a great primer on how to think about branding and marketing.

Lenny (00:58:25):
Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:27):
Favorite recent movie, The Menu and favorite recent TV show? Netflix show is a Cyberpunk 2077 Edge Runners.

Lenny (00:58:38):
Oh, wow. I haven't heard of that one.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:39):
Oh, you should check it out. It's super cool.

Lenny (00:58:42):
I'll go check it out.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:43):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:58:43):
Favorite interview question that you like to ask.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:46):
Tell me about a subject or activity you've been obsessed with for a long time.

Lenny (00:58:51):
What do you look for in an answer that's like, okay, this is good.

Kevin Aluwi (00:58:54):
I want somebody to basically almost pitch to me an obsession they have than makes me interested in knowing more into that subject. The more obscure, the better and the more passionate they are about an obscure thing, even better. And I think it shows people's capability to be really passionate about something and sell something and think about something in a very structured and detailed way.

Lenny (00:59:25):
What are some products that you love and have recently discovered?

Kevin Aluwi (00:59:30):
Two products, I think right now that I've found absolutely delightful. One is the ARC Browser. I know that it's gaining a lot of traction out there, but I'm a very chronic tab hoarder. My Chrome tabs are just all over the place, and I love that they've figured out I would say the best approach to kind of tab management, and there's just a ton of little delightful, awesome design details in the app that I think is just really cool. And it's a browser. When's the last time there was a really cool browser that came out? So I also love the ambition that the company has.

(01:00:09):
Second product, Steam Deck. I'm a huge gamer, and I think it is probably, I would say the best game platform to actually build on the vision of truly portable mobile gaming.

Lenny (01:00:25):
I love your point with ARC for tab hoarders. I also used to have a lot of tabs and I love it just auto deletes stuff and just disappear, and it forces you to lose your tabs and it works out surprisingly.

Kevin Aluwi (01:00:38):
Final question.

Lenny (01:00:38):
I'm curious what comes up for this one? What's something you've recently changed or that you've heard of someone at Gojek recently changed in their product development process that was maybe minor, that had a tremendous impact on the team's ability to execute.

Kevin Aluwi (01:00:53):
One relatively minor thing that I thought had a lot of impact with execution is being very clear that whoever is accountable for the results should also be the decider. I found that a lot of literature out there says that product teams should be this communal best ideas come from everywhere group, which I think is well-intentioned and absolutely everyone should contribute ideas, but I think not having it be super clear who is accountable and who is deciding often slows down execution a lot. And I think when we switch to making it really clear that who was the decider for any kind of product development process, I think our execution definitely improved significantly.

Lenny (01:01:37):
Amazing. Kevin, thank you so much for being here. Gojek is such an interesting and important story, and I feel like most founders can learn something from the story, so I was really excited to bring you on and to hear a lot of these wild stories that you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find your line if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Aluwi (01:01:57):
I am @kaluwi on Twitter. That's also my email, kaluwi@gmail.com. I'll always be happy to chat about Gojek or just generally anything technology related. Again, I have nothing I'm working on at the moment, so I just would love to jam with cool people.

Lenny (01:02:22):
Amazing. Thank you again for being here.

Kevin Aluwi (01:02:25):
Thanks, Lenny.

# Unorthodox PM tips: Automating user insights, unselling candidates, decision logs, more | Kevin Yien

## Transcript

Kevin Yien (00:00:00):
The PM job can become a little too internal, influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. But if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):
You think every PM should keep a decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:00:13):
We all talk about product sense. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data. PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):
We have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email.

Kevin Yien (00:00:31):
When you get to offer stage, I send an email and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. If you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join you, find yourself a A+ hire.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):
I'm curious if you found any interesting uses of AI in your work.

Kevin Yien (00:00:49):
We are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):
Today, my guest is Kevin Yien. Kevin leads product for merchant experiences at Stripe. Before that, he built the restaurant business and the ecosystem teams at Square, and most recently was head of product and design at Mutiny. He also makes ice cream and, as you'll hear in there conversation, was a pretty competitive eater for some part of his life.

(00:01:17):
In our conversation, Kevin shares a ton of unique and insightful perspectives on how to be a successful product manager, including how to get into product management, how to improve your relationship with your engineers and designers, bunch of advice on hiring, why you should keep a decision log, how to automate your customer research, plus a ton of really powerful stories around failure and AI and career.

(00:01:40):

(00:02:00):
Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kevin Yien (00:02:04):
Thanks, Lenny. I am humbled to be here.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):
I've been a big fan of yours from afar. I've been following you on Twitter for a long time. You have a very distinct profile photo that I feel like you maybe haven't changed for a long time. How long have you had this profile?

Kevin Yien (00:02:16):
Oh gosh, probably 2011 or 2012. The story behind that is I was inspired actually by Chris Dixon's avatar at the time and I wanted something really similar to it, but I couldn't figure out how to. Luckily, I was dating a designer at the time, and so she made me that sort of custom pick that has been my profile since then, and she's now my wife.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):
Oh my god. Funny enough, I had a startup idea once where it's like a profile picture as a service business where there's these three tiers where it's like one has automated, one has someone illustrates, and one is a professional photo. It feels like everyone profile photos are so important.

Kevin Yien (00:02:54):
True.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:55):
But I never follow through. Probably not a good business anyway.

Kevin Yien (00:02:59):
Yeah, but a good idea, a good tool.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:00):
Good idea. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel better.

(00:03:03):
I've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time. As I said, I've been a big fan of yours for a long time. Something that I've noticed about you is you have a lot of really unique perspectives on a lot of different things, and in particular, product management, how to be successful as a PM, how to get into product management, things like that. So I thought it'd be fun to start there talking through some of these things that I've heard you talk about and then get into some very tactical stuff that you found to be useful in your product management career.

(00:03:29):
The first thing that I've heard you talk about is that you discourage people from going straight into product management. If they want to become product managers, you encourage them to start somewhere else first. Why is that? Where do you think people should start? Talk about this insight that you've had.

Kevin Yien (00:03:45):
Yeah, so follow me on the detour to science world temporarily. If we all remember high school science classes, there was this concept of potential and kinetic energy. There's so many different definitions for product management, but the one that I have come to myself that I really like is, when you are building a product, you have this team, engineers, designers, so much potential. The purpose of product management, not the person, but the practice, is to convert that potential into as much realized value for someone as possible, right? Minimum loss. When you're just getting started with a new product, the people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person. They're the front line of the smallest loop possible to get something going, and it's through those practices that I think you're able to get the most exposure to what it takes to build a good product.

(00:04:50):
And then from there, that's your foundation. That's the unique perspective that you bring and allows you then to actually take on a "role" of product manager in a good, unique, insightful way. That's sort of like the foundation. There's a lot more to unpack behind that comparison, but that's where it comes from.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):
I love that. I'd love to unpack it further.

(00:05:10):
This episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.AI. Back in 2020 when AI was just a toy, BuildBetter bet that it could cut down on a product teams' operational BS. Fast-forward to today, 23,000 product teams use purpose-built AI in BuildBetter every day.

I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.

Christina (00:06:30):
Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:32):
What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.

Christina (00:06:47):
Yes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):
I can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.

Christina (00:07:21):
Absolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many four stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We have laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):
I know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.

(00:07:54):
Every PM has their definition of what is product management, and I have one that I'm trying to find exactly what I wrote, but essentially, it's to marshal the resources of your team to solve customer problems and drive business impact most efficiently, something like that. And I feel like it's very aligned with your perspective, but I really love this view of it's unlocking the potential energy of the team. Not just marshaling the resources of a team, but it's there, and your job is to maximize their effort. And this is why when people say, "I hate product managers. I don't want any product managers at my team. We don't need product managers here," I feel like that's often because you've had a bad PM. Good PMs make you better and make your life better, allow you to do the work you want to do and they take all the stuff you don't want to do, make sure the stuff you're doing is worthwhile.

(00:08:38):
Is there anything more you want to add along those lines?

Kevin Yien (00:08:41):
To elaborate on that, I think the broader point is that truly not every team needs a product manager, but the activities, the outcome that one would drive needs to get done no matter what. And in some cases, this is why the prototypical companies that everyone references when they say, "They never had product managers, look at how successful they are," they're all building for themselves. Stripe, Twilio, Figma, designers for designers, engineers for engineers. When you are the customer, why the heck do you need someone else to help do the things that let you make decisions on what to build? But if you are not the customer, if you're working in a particularly complex space, if there's something that you, as the person that could build the product, feel you don't have, that's when you can essentially delegate that responsibility to someone else to say, "Hey, let me do the things I'm really good at and you do something that I need to get my job done."

(00:09:39):
So it's that sort of relationship that I think is often missing in the discourse. I think it would alleviate a lot of the, "We don't want PMs. PM is useless" or, "PM's one of the best thing since [inaudible 00:09:52]," which they're not. It's just a manifestation of that problem.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):
Yeah. Just to build on that, we're going on a tangent, but I think that's really interesting. I think there's another element of that, SNAP actually is another example where they waited, I think, until they had 200 people before they hired their first PM. To me, that's an example of other people were doing the PM job. As you said, there's PM activity, someone's doing them, lining people, prioritizing, making sure things are clear, making sure people aren't surprised, all these things PMs do. Someone's doing that, and my feeling is like, "Okay, your designers may love doing that, great. Let them do it." If your engineers that have a lot of product sense may want to do that, great.

(00:10:28):
But there's some point they either is like, "Forget it. I just want to code. I want to build that. I want to be sitting around in meetings all day," or they just aren't as good as things are scaling. And so it's kind of like, if your engineers, designers want to do it and are good at it, great. You don't need PMs for a long time. Oftentimes they're not good at it or they don't want to be sitting in doing all these PM things.

Kevin Yien (00:10:46):
Yep, precisely.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):
Okay, so going back to the question of... So your advice is don't go straight into product management if you want to become a great PM. Where do you think people should start if they can? What are some options you recommend?

Kevin Yien (00:10:58):
The best way to think about this, in my opinion, is who were the people that you would be taking the PM responsibilities from and then do those jobs? And so for me, the sort of foundational three are going to be engineer, designer or salesperson. I think sales also gets not a bad rep, but a misrepresented reputation in tech where all they care about is quota, it's just about numbers, et cetera. In reality, the best salespeople are the best listeners, the best people at understanding the problem that the customer is having and then translating that into what you can do for them. And so if you get really good at having those calls, getting told no a lot, and being able to translate that, I mean, why would you not want to start there and then eventually move into something like product? So that's the foundational three for me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):
So your advice is essentially if you want to be a PM, start as a designer or an engineer or a salesperson. I was an engineer, so this is exactly the path I went on. And I think there's an element of you start there and then you realize you're never going to be as amazing as the other people at that role and you're like, "Okay, maybe I should explore this other thing," because I was like, "I'm never going to be an amazing engineer. I'm good enough."

Kevin Yien (00:12:18):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:18):
I'm like, "I'm pretty good at this other stuff. Let's explore that."

Kevin Yien (00:12:21):
The one thing that I might tack on there, because this could lead to a negative perception, is, "Well, I'm never going to be a world-class engineer, world-class designer or et cetera, and so let me settle for being a PM." That could be the conclusion you arrive at, but I think a better way of framing it is, "I'm okay at those things. I'm potentially world-class at this other thing. Let me see what it feels like to double down on this area."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):
Absolutely.

Kevin Yien (00:12:45):
And I think that's just a good framing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):
Okay, so let's talk about another insight and piece of advice that you have, is that you think that great PMs need to be great writers. I think a lot of people don't necessarily think this. I think people may probably think, "If I'm an okay writer, I can probably be really successful PM." Talk about why you think it's so important to be a really great writer to be a really great PM.

Kevin Yien (00:13:07):
It's actually shocking for me to hear that this isn't commonplace sort of acceptance, but the place that this comes from for me is, writing is clarity at scale, and a key component to a PM's job is creating clarity both internally and externally, but it is both sides of that that I think often get lost. A lot of times the PM job can become a little too internal, and it's about influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. Don't get me wrong, all that's very important. You should write your PRDs, they should be super crisp, they should articulate things really well, but I'm not saying that every PM needs to be a marketer or a world-class copywriter, but you should be able to write really compelling messaging in the voice of the person that you're trying to serve. And I'm working backwards from the beliefs that, if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product. And so that's where I think writing is the foundational component there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):
There's a few quotes I say often on this podcast just because they always come to mind. One is by Joan Didion who said that, "I don't know what I think until I've written it down." And that's what I find with writing where I need to actually write it down for me to really understand what the heck I'm thinking to really crystallize it.

Kevin Yien (00:14:26):
Yeah, and I think writing is, it's both a mechanism for translating what you're trying to think into that thought into what you're actually trying to do, but then it needs additional revs to be properly consumed by everyone else. And that's I think the really hard part that a lot of folks don't do the extra mile effort to take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):
And this to your earlier point of a job of PM is to unlock this potential energy of your team, of the various resources you have and obviously having everyone aligned behind a very, like, "This is what we are doing and everyone understanding it" and it being very clear is really powerful there.

(00:15:06):
Okay. So this begs the question, how does one become a great writer? What helped you become a better writer? How do you feel about your ability to write at this point?

Kevin Yien (00:15:13):
Oh man.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):
Any advise on becoming better?

Kevin Yien (00:15:16):
I'll start with a slightly cheeky comment, which is, I think some of this is changing with the advent of large language models and the ability to actually just mimic someone else's tone. But I take inspiration from the camp of Anthony Bourdain, and he has, I'm going to butcher the exact quote but it's something like, "If you want to know how to make good food, you have to eat a lot of food, and you have to be willing to have a bad meal every now and again." And so for me, good writing comes from consuming as much good writing as possible. Sometimes you'll read something and say, "That was actually absolute fresh." But that's okay, you have to be willing to take on some of that stuff. But the more you index towards developing your own taste for what you think is good by consuming others, then you can shift into producing your own and then comparing them and riffing it off other people. So I think that's sort of the cycle that I've gone through.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:13):
I have a friend who's a very good writer and a poet and helped me develop my writing early on, Vanessa, and she said exactly the same thing. Just to become a better writer, read beautiful writing, and it just kind of infuses you or your brain. In your experience, is there anything you read, anything you found really effective? Anything that you think influenced the way you write or think that people can check out?

Kevin Yien (00:16:36):
I explicitly do not mean read a bunch of other PM artifacts. You're not going to become a better writer by reading PRDs or whatever it is or support articles. It needs to be writing that compels. That's the theme I would go back to because that's what you're trying to do at the end of the day.

(00:16:56):
And when I say compels, I mean it pushes you to action. Because if you read something and you're like, "Oh, that's interesting," that's not enough. You need to be able to give someone something that then allows them to do something differently. And so the things for me that have been best... Obviously there's all the Paul Graham essays, I think his writing is very succinct, very clear, that's not novel. I learned a lot by finding specific voices back in the day on Twitter, and it wasn't always what they were posting on Twitter, but if they wrote an essay or a post, that would be their crispus thinking. And so you can use these broadcast channels to find where their golden nuggets are, but then spend time with those instead and don't worry about all the additional noise that comes with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):
Paul Graham actually, you mentioned him, he has a great piece on how to become a good, that we'll link to, where basically his advice is, write the way you talk. Just keep it really simple and really regular. And so we'll link to that. Is there anything else along these lines of writing that you'd recommend for folks that are like, "Okay, I need to become a great writer. How do I do this?"?

Kevin Yien (00:18:02):
Actually along the lines of write how you talk, there's this concept of cadence that I think is really important when it comes to internal writing. There's probably some very good article about this, but it's the idea that if you only write in a monotonous cadence, either all really short sentences or all really long sentences, then your brain just tunes out eventually. And so you have to interrupt the pattern intentionally, and so you go short-long, long-short, whatever it is, but there's a few various specific things that you can do that allow someone to just roll through a post or something when you write that way.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:18:43):
Along those lines, there's a book that I just found to make sure I had the right title called Several Short Sentences About Writing that is really helpful along these lines. And the whole book is very short sentences and it teaches you to write very short sentences because once you're good at that, you can get better writing longer sentences. And so we'll link to that too. It's like a really good book that I have two copies around my house that I kind of poke at sometimes.

Kevin Yien (00:19:08):
Nice. I'll have [inaudible 00:19:09] too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):
Okay. Another area that you have a really clever insight into is how the PM role fits with engineering design. We've talked about this a little bit, but you have a really clever way of just thinking about how these roles interact and who's responsible for what. Talk about that.

Kevin Yien (00:19:24):
So this description came from writing PRDs at Square. I think there was a lot of confusion from my team specifically when I joined them. For what it's worth, it was new product line, three engineers, three designers, there was nothing but a slide deck.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):
Three engineers and three designers?

Kevin Yien (00:19:43):
The best ratio ever. This is a whole other thing. Most people, I would say, under invest in design, point-blank. When you get to a certain scale, maybe things change, but truly I don't think most teams have experienced what it feels like to have a really high design ratio and what that actually does to the quality of the work and the quality of the thinking. So shout out to designers. We need more, is the short version. And I would rather hire an incremental designer than PM almost any day of the week.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):
Wow. I've never experienced this ratio. Incredible.

Kevin Yien (00:20:21):
Yes, I was very lucky. Shout out to Bruce Bell, who was my manager at the time, who was an ex designer, at the time, GM, and declared that starting ratio.

(00:20:31):
So anyways, with that setup, they all had sort of an opinion. They had seen PRDs in the past, they weren't quite sure what the purpose of it actually was because they had designs already. They had something to start from. And when I came in and talked to everyone and figured out where we needed to be in a year's time, I was like, "Okay, here's how I think it. Let me know if you agree." And this is a whole other concept, which is, the best way to get feedback from people is not by asking what they think, but to put something concrete in front of them and then have them react to it, right? So chewing fork.

(00:21:03):
And so my description is, PM should be doing everything in their power to draw the perimeter of the space, of the problem space. And it's within that, eng, design, everyone else that you're working with, they can go as crazy as they want, push up against the bounds and it's fill the box to its maximum capacity, but you've now applied the constraints that allow you to actually have productive conversations.

(00:21:26):
On the other end of the spectrum though, I think there's a lot of folks who think, "Oh, PMs are just strategy high in the clouds. All they do is kick things off." You need to be obsessed about the final deliverable and whether or not value is actually getting to the customer. I have a really trite example of this if you want to go down it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):
Please.

Kevin Yien (00:21:46):
But the key point I want to make is, I think it is tempting when we think about engineering product and design to draw these really clear swim lanes and say, "You do X. I do Y. Don't tread on my area." But you need these murky overlaps in order to build something really good.

(00:22:07):
And so even if the engineers are going to build a better product than you and the designers are going to design something better than you, you need to come with a strong opinion and you need to do the legwork to get their trust so they actually care about your opinion in the first place.

(00:22:21):
So time for a mini story. So Square, we're building a point of sale for restaurants. If you've ever seen one of these in a restaurant, there's this sort of grid of tiles that they tap to enter your order when you're sitting down for dinner. We were developing one, and there's this concept of a menu group. So it's a little box, you tap on it and then it pops the screen in so you go to the next level of the hierarchy. So example would be you have a wine button, you tap it, and you see your reds, whites, et cetera.

(00:22:53):
If you think about the people that we were trying to serve, there's the restaurants that were coming from a really old legacy system. And if you've seen a bartender tap on one of these, I mean it is muscle memory to the max. They're not even looking at the thing and just punching in the order blindfolded, and it's rapid fast.

(00:23:12):
On the other hand, you have people who are entering the workforce the first time, they've never used a point of sale. And so we have to serve both of these equally. Well, how do you deal with that level of speed but also the ease of use that anyone can learn it for the first time? And so there was this interaction that we really cared about, which was, when you tap on a menu group, what's the animation to pop you into that next level? This seems like such a small thing, but it made the difference in how easy it was to adopt for a lot of the restaurants.

(00:23:41):
And so a designer and myself spent literally an entire week just fine-tuning how many milliseconds it would take to pop in and out so that it felt right. And we actually brought in servers and bartenders to play with the prototypes we had on iPads and be like, "Here's an order. Pop it in." And we would see where they would sort of flinch or hesitate because the animation was too slow and they thought, "I can't tap it yet," or something related to that.

(00:24:07):
And so it's easy, I think, for a PM to say, "That's not my responsibility. I define the requirements. Have a menu group that goes to the next level, design or engineer, figure it out." No way. That's fully on you, and you better be involved in those details.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):
I love this. There's two directions I want to go. So there's the drawing the perimeter, and then there's this paying attention to the final deliverable and keeping the borrow really high, which I love and I totally agree with both.

(00:24:34):
In terms of this animation, people hearing this, that our PMs are going to be like, "How do you have time to spend a week on animation for one little product? I have so much to do. I get to hit some goals, drive some numbers. I have people waiting for me." Maybe because Square is like this, once you deploy, it's harder to change and it's like a big deal to ship. But I'm curious if you have any advice or things you've learned about how to create space for that sort of thing to create time to spend a week on this animation? Or was it just obvious to everyone, "We need to spend as much time as we can"? Top down, everyone knew.

Kevin Yien (00:25:07):
I definitely don't think it was obvious to everyone, and I can definitely say that because we were given a pretty strict deadline that we needed to launch by and I pushed it out three times. That's not because of this one animation, but it's because of a series of decisions where we said, "This is what we believe we need to ship, and this matters much more than hitting some artificial external GA date."

(00:25:35):
There's this other aspect that I think PMs like to feel good about how busy they are and they're like, "I'm involved in so many processes and I have to talk to this person and talk to that person." All that might be true, but I think there needs to be a calibration or at least a spring-cleaning of, "What's everything I'm doing?" and how much do these things actually matter to getting value to a customer. Because as a company gets bigger, as teams get more complex, it's very easy and natural to spend more time on things that are internally-focused and not externally-focused. I think we just all have to have sensitive antenna to that so that we don't fall prey to, "Well, the way that my job is described is to do these things," but really it's the outcome again of put something in a customer's hands that's also a problem, and it's amazing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):
Reminds me of your now colleague Jeff Weinstein's advice he got from one of the Coulsons where they came to him and they're like, "You're world-class at doing the second and third most important things and you're not focusing on the most important thing because it's so hard, and that's something you need to work on."

Kevin Yien (00:26:47):
Totally. I will say so one on that, the CEO at Mutiny, Charlie, she always repeated to me nonstop, "Keep the main thing the main thing" and would just say it ad nauseum, and I'm really glad that she did. The one excuse I don't want to give folks is, as you progress in your career, you have to walk and chew gum at the same time. You can't say, "Oh, I'm only focused on this thing over here, so other folks handle that." You do have to figure out how to do a little bit more at the same time, but prioritization does play a factor.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):
There's a framework [inaudible 00:27:27] suggested that I really like, the LNO framework. I forget exactly what the LNO stands for, but leverage something something. And we'll link to it in the show notes that gives you some advice on how to prioritize your time based on the stuff.

Kevin Yien (00:27:38):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):
Okay. So I guess in the case of pushing back to create space, this was just you as a product leader recognizing, "This is really important to get right. I will convince people we need to make more time for that."

Kevin Yien (00:27:50):
I don't want to make it seem like it was me against everyone because that was definitely not the case. I think the starting engineers and designers on that team really cared about the quality of what they built too. That's a pretty structural DNA for a team as well. If you don't start with that, and as a comparison, you have a team that really prides themselves on shipping fast and meeting deadlines really prescriptively, you might end up in a different world or your role as a PM might be a little bit more challenging if you want to push on this stuff. So I do think you have to take into account what is the DNA of the team. And then can you exploit that? Which I was able to do. Or do you actually have some change management to put into effect if you believe that it's worthwhile?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):
Let's go back to the perimeter, drawing the perimeter concept to make that a little more real for people. So your advice here is the role of a PM, part of your main job, especially when it comes to engineers and design is to draw the perimeter for the team. Can you make that a little more real? What's an example of that maybe from something you worked on? What does that look like?

Kevin Yien (00:28:58):
Totally. The best word to describe the perimeter is just constraints. At the end of the day, you should be adding as many constraints as reasonable in order to let engineers and designers come up with the most creative solutions for whatever you're trying to do.

(00:29:15):
And so again, if we just stay focused on this point of sale example, one constraint would be, "Who the hell are we serving? Are we trying to go after sit-down restaurants that are serving five different courses and have a 200 item wine list? Or are we trying to serve the taco truck?" Those will lead to very different spaces. And if you leave both on the table, the lack of that constraint makes designing a good solution that much harder, that there instances where you actually can't apply that many constraints. But I bet that if you push on enough different axes, you eventually scope it down to a point where it feels really good for the team. It's just about how do you remove decisions, right? Because this I think is maybe a trite phrase, but the best decision is no decision. If you don't even have to think about the decision, the team is that much more effective.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):
So yo give people a few maybe even pointers of, "I need to create more constraints maybe for my team to help them go crazy, but within this box that we all agree on," so you mentioned make sure the user's clear of who you're designing for. Is there anything else, just thinking about maybe the PRD someone's trying to write to help create this constraint? What other maybe bullet points, sections would you imagine or do you find useful to add?

Kevin Yien (00:30:25):
So beyond customer segment/like-what-their-specific-role is, I think another one would be, we can loosely call it, jobs to be done, even though I know that's becoming an increasingly loaded term.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):
Yeah, it's great.

Kevin Yien (00:30:36):
But what's the thing they're trying to do and how many different pathways are you willing to entertain around it? That's another one that I would think about. Depending on what you're building, there's availability. So do you care about desktop web, mobile web, native mobile, et cetera? And maybe another one to think through just as an example would be, this is probably getting closer to what a lot of people think about in terms of principles, but what are the things that you want to be known for when you ship a product? One example there might be speed. And so if you say speed is more important than consistency of data, that's a huge tradeoff and constraint that you can give the team." Oh my god, if an engineer hears I don't need real time consistency of data, I can do so much cool stuff and easily accomplish that speed thing." And so that's just a very technical example maybe.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):
Awesome. Okay, I'm glad I followed up on that. There's a couple more things you mentioned that I want to come back to real quick. The first is this tuning fork idea. I completely agree, this point you made, that the best way to get feedback from your team is to take a first pass at it, and here's a rough quick draft. I find with design, especially if you design something ugly, designers are often like, "Let me make that better. We can't stand this thing." Is there anything else you want to add there? Just this idea of tuning fork as a feedback strategy.

Kevin Yien (00:32:03):
Okay, there's two areas we can go deeper on here. One is in how you get the feedback. So this is definitely a Square-ism, I think it was probably adopted from Amazon, which is around the silent read of documents. When you are all so busy and someone's like, "I wrote a doc," you send it into the Slack ecosystem and everyone goes, "Please give feedback." You have so much going on... You'll be lucky to maybe get a response. Maybe there's one or two people that chime in.

(00:32:35):
And so even though we hate meetings and we love asynchronous, there is a lot of value to saying, "I need 20 minutes of focused time to interrogate something that I've done. We're not going to talk. I'm literally going to force us into a room or Zoom. You're going to read this doc, I'm going to watch you comment on it in real time. I'm going to respond to your comments in real time. And at the end of this thing I'm going to have enough really good input that I can do a huge rub on this thing and get to the next phase."

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:08):
I love that. So it's basically instead of, "Hey, I'm sending you this doc to go review, give me feedback," it's, "I'm going to schedule a meeting, and the meeting is for you to spend time reviewing this doc and giving me feedback and then maybe we could talk about it."

Kevin Yien (00:33:19):
Yep. And I think a lot of people are going to hate hearing that because like, "Oh my god, I have so many meetings already. Why do I want another meeting that isn't even a meeting?" But that's the best kind then, because it's actual work getting done, right? And maybe you carve out two minutes at the end for one really immediate discussion topic or something. But I don't think we give enough space in any type of meeting for people to actually think. And when you are just staring at a doc with your camera off and the only expectation is to engage with that thing, thoughts are a little bit better and crisper.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):
And I think with this idea, if someone says, "I want a meeting where you just sit and review this doc," you could always say, "Let me just review it asynchronously. I'll give you feedback, I promise. Give me 24 hours." Right? It's not like they have to come to this meeting.

Kevin Yien (00:34:07):
Although I would urge you to make them come to the meeting.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):
Okay, say more there, because you find that that's a lot more effective.

Kevin Yien (00:34:14):
I think there's two sneaky things hiding behind that. One is the, "Yeah, I'll get to this in the next 24 hours." Maybe they don't. Maybe you've really trust that person and they're the exception. But beyond that, there is something else to the real time interaction that can happen when you're commenting and responding on a dock at the same time. I think this is the part that often gets lost, which is the latency between a comments or question and a quick follow-up from the author just pushes that cycle speed really long in a way that doesn't need to be. And so when people are trying to find how do you move faster, this actually is one of those very good examples of moving slower to move faster.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):
It reminds me Claire Vo, I think it was her phrase of moving one clock speed faster, and just like that's the way you speed up a company is try to move one clock speed faster, which in this case is just reduce the time between feedback and iteration. I love it.

(00:35:13):
Okay, I want to shift to talking about a few very tactical things that you've found really helpful in your PM career and something you recommend to other product teams. The first is something you call a decision log. You think every PM should keep a decision log. Talk about what that is and why that's powerful.

Kevin Yien (00:35:32):
I will say there's two different decision logs we could talk about. We'll focus on the former though. The latter is just as you're making decisions within your job, you should document those within a PRD. Make sure everyone knows. It's just a silly, very small thing, but I think every PM should do it.

(00:35:48):
The other decision log though that I think is quite critical is if we zoom out for a second, every person has something that they can do to slightly increment in their craft. Sprinters have certain exercises that they do. There's something beautiful about pianists and piano scales where it doesn't matter if you are just learning the piano or you are a 30-year veteran, you're still doing your scales, and it's because it lays the foundation for everything else that you need to do.

(00:36:23):
And so we all talk about product sense. It's this super mystical thing that no one knows how to get better at. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data, and the core of that is decisions. And so PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them. And so the natural followup would be, "Well, I only have to make X decisions in my job. How the hell do I make more of them?" Look around you. There's other teams that are making decisions. What would you do if you were in that position with the information you have? Great, write it down. Say why.

(00:37:06):
There's other companies that are doing crazy things. What are they doing? What would you do if you were responsible for the roadmap? Write it down. A year later, see what they've shipped. You can just do this for anyone. It's free, and no one takes the time to do it, but that's how I think you get better at actually making decisions, is just doing more of them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:24):
Hearing you describe this, it feels like, "Obviously yes, why aren't we doing this? How else can we get better if we're not reflecting back on the decisions we've made? And realizing, "Hey, I made a bunch of bad decisions, but I'm always so confident in my decision still, maybe shouldn't be. So I guess first of all, do you actually do this? How often do you do this? And is there an example of you learning something from your own decision log?

Kevin Yien (00:37:50):
Many. And many of them because it was a wrong decision. But yes, I do keep a decision log. I have a separate sort of practice where it's just a daily log, which is everyone wants the perfect note-taking system. To me, the best note-taking system is inspired by... What is it called? big ass text file, BATF. There's a funny blog post from 2001 on it, but it's just, you write everything that happens to you in a day in a bolded list and it's all in one big note. That way you can command F it, do whatever you want. The way that I keep track of it is I do a little hashtag decision and then write things down just as I think about them. And then I'll have a reminder to comb back through on some cadence.

(00:38:36):
And so I'll first use a positive example, which is a funny one. So if you rewind to, I don't even know what year, but Shopify had just launched Shop app, their consumer application for what started as tracking your order when you bought something from a Shopify customer and then it's evolved into a full-blown Amazon competitor, where you can actually find merchants and buy things through it.

(00:39:03):
When they first launched it though, I was like, "Oh my God, this is so brilliant. They have completely hijacked this specific loop for consumer buying behavior via this very unassuming thing, which is package tracking." And so that morning I was like, "Whatever, I'm going to quickly draw a diagram of this flywheel that I think Amazon owns today. I'm going to show how Shopify is slowly planting their little seed to take over this and how Shop app fits into it." I tweeted out. And then I don't know, that day there must have been 60 Shopify employees that followed me. I was like, "What the hell is this guy talking about?"

(00:39:40):
And so funny enough, fast-forward, I've talked to some of the folks that worked on it and they're like, "Yeah, nailed it. Here's what we were thinking. Here's why." It's no longer secret sauce. But that was a really interesting example of both doing a decision log, putting my rationale down on paper. In this case, broadcasting it out, but then having that be a mechanism for it making its way back to me to actually better understand why did they make the decision versus what I thought, because the reasons were a little bit different, but the outcome was the same. So that's one interesting example.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):
It's an amazing story. You doing this explains why you've been so successful. I could see how this all connects now. I think for a lot of people, they would want to build this habit. Clearly there's a lot of value here, but they just don't because they got a lot of other things going on or it's just like this new thing they have to start doing. Is there anything that helped you adopt this practice of this daily log/decision log that you think might be helpful to folks to motivate them to give this a shot?

Kevin Yien (00:40:40):
This is probably just general advice on building any habit, which is start small and just force yourself to do it. And there's that old saying around, how do you start running as a hobby? You don't do it by saying, "I'm going to run a mile every day." You do it by putting your sneakers at the foot of your bed unless you take your shoes off inside, then you put it at the front door, you have your shorts ready to go and you're like, "I commit to putting on my shorts. And if I decide after getting dressed to go run, that I still don't want to go run. Okay, fine." But you build up to that thing.

(00:41:16):
I think decision logs are the lightest weight thing possible. And so you can start super easy by saying, "You know what? Every Sunday morning I'm going to scroll through Twitter, I'm going to check out Hacker News, whatever it is, I'm going to see something interesting and I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to place my decision on this thing." Write it down, and then set a calendar invite in X weeks, X months to see what plays out. And that's all it is, right? 10 minutes once a week, super easy. And then over time you can crank it up. And then eventually you're just constantly writing these decisions down and then it's like feeding its way back into you. It becomes second nature.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):
And you're touching on something that there's been a little bit of talk on this podcast and newsletter post about this idea of to get better product sense and product taste and also just decision making this case, one of the best strategies is to simulate other people's decisions and simulate what they're thinking through and predict what they're going to do, which is what you're describing here.

Kevin Yien (00:42:12):
Totally. I do want to apply a pretty severe caveat here though, which is, a decision log is not a replacement for building products. It's a additional complimentary thing that you can be doing on your own. But if you think that you can just sit back in your chair, look out at the market, make a bunch of calls and be like, "Look at how smart I'm getting without actually being hands-on with building a product," you're not actually going to get any better. So I just want to interject that

Lenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):
Amazing caveat, very important. Don't just sit and read Hacker News and think you're going to be become an amazing founder or product leader.

(00:42:49):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments.

(00:44:07):
If someone wants to try this idea of a daily log, what is it exactly? Say decision log or daily log, is it just things that happen today and then hashtag, "Here's a decision I made, or here's a decision I think Shopify will make in the future"? Is that the format?

Kevin Yien (00:44:21):
Yeah, it depends on how far you want to go down productivity and notetaking as to rabbit holes, but let's start basic. This is not what I do, but I think it's the easiest place to start. Spin up a Google doc or a Notion page, just call it daily log and then bullet point out the date of today. And then as you're going through your day, you have a meeting, just type in the meeting name. If there's a takeaway, put it under there. If there's a decision you can make, do hashtag decision. And in this case, say, "Shopify launch Shop app. I think this is their way to take over the fulfillment to buying behavior loop. The reason for that is X, Y, Z." Follow up on this in six months and then set your calendar invite.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:02):
Awesome. So as motivation for listeners to try this sort of thing, just look at the success Kevin has had as in his career and how insightful he has been so far and will continue to be. And this is how these happen. This is how your mind learns to see things in a really unique, interesting way. So I know you're modest and aren't going to take any credit, but I'm just saying this is how you get better, is trying stuff like this.

Kevin Yien (00:45:24):
Footnote, correlation versus causation. It's all put out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:27):
Could be all genes. Could be completely unrelated to anything you've done entire life, I suspect.

Kevin Yien (00:45:33):
Could just be me being very lucky, I'll put that out there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):
Could also be luck. Okay, so something I wanted to touch on with this decision log idea, and it's a segue to talking about hiring, is I think interviewing is also really good opportunity to try some like this. I feel like people interview lots of people. They think they know what they're looking for. They think they've made all these decisions. They think they have these amazing interview questions that are going to help them see really good signal, but you never actually go back and see, "Was I right? Should we have hired that person? Did this person work out? Was that question asked them at all inform? Was it at all a leading indicator of anything?" And I feel like this is a really good method for improving your interviewing abilities, is like, "Here's the questions asked. Here's what I decided. Here's what I think," and then a year later look back, "Was that actually right?"

Kevin Yien (00:46:16):
Yeah, totally. I think some of the best companies actually do have a practice around this where they have a 6, 12, 18 month check-in on new hires and they then compare their performance against level hired at and then review against the scorecards. It's a pretty laborious process. So startups aren't probably going to do it in the same amount of rigor, but it shows you so much about the holes in your interviewing process. So I definitely plus one of that one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:46:50):
I love that. Oh my god, that puts all this pressure on your score, which is great. So that's actually a segue talking about hiring. There's a couple more tactics that I've seen you be really good at. So one is just hiring in general. You have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email where you try to convince someone not to join your company. Talk about that and why you think that's effective and then anything else along the lines of hiring you've learned.

Kevin Yien (00:47:11):
I'll say the idea of the unsell email came from a place of failure, which is at Square I had shifted into a position where I had to hire a lot of people really quickly. And through that, as a fairly new hiring manager, you're like, "All right, great. I've been told the goal is to hire fast." Okay, you give me a metric, you're going to go after it. So you do your best to get as many people in the door as possible. When you're talking to your recruiting partner, they're incentivized to increase pass through rates, offer to close rates, all these other things, and so they're like, "Yeah, this person's really good." And you listen. "Yeah, they are pretty good, aren't they?" Even though there's a sneaking suspicion that maybe they're not the right fit, but you move forward anyways.

(00:47:54):
So fast-forward, there's a few folks I bring on, and within six months they come to me and they're like, "This is not at all what I thought I was going to do. This is not the environment I thought I was going to walk into. You didn't warn me about this, that and the other. I feel terrible. How do I prevent this?" And the reason it's bad is not just because they feel surprised, but because then, either one, they decide to leave, two, they're not performing because it's not the right role or environment for them, or three, maybe the company is still good, but that role isn't. And so they immediately try to do internal mobility or something to another team, which then leaves you with the same hole. So all of those bad outcomes. [inaudible 00:48:37] "How do I prevent this?" Well, I just got to front load all the gnarly stuff they're going to find out in their first six months.

(00:48:44):
And so the practice I started developing is you go through the whole interview process. During that period, you're collecting all these little concerns, fears, anxieties that they're not explicitly saying, but they're definitely hinting at. You got to be pretty honest with yourself about which ones are real. But then when you get to offer stage, I send an email with no more than eight bullet points and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. I'm pretty candid about, "This is what it's like here." Maybe one example would be, "Hey, I'm a parent and I'm worried about work-life balance." Maybe they don't say that explicitly in the interview process, but you get a feeling for it. And I get that as a parent too.

(00:49:31):
So if I'm at a startup, I'll be really clear and I'll say, "You know what? We are a series A startup. We are pushing really hard at product-market fit. The expectation here is going to be that you're online at 10:00, that you can occasionally hop on a meeting on a Saturday or Sunday." And if you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join, you find yourself an A+ hire. But if they read that and they're like," I don't know anymore," it's way better to say, "Great, this is not a good fit. Let's go our separate ways" than have them leave after six months.

(00:50:08):
When I first instituted this, I lost 30% of candidates at offer stage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):
Oh wow.

Kevin Yien (00:50:13):
Which drove my recruiting partners insane because they look terrible. Their manager is like, "What the hell are you doing? You're losing everyone at the very end." And so they ask, "Can you either not send this thing?" Or, "Can you send it at the very beginning?" And my answer is no, because I don't know what they're afraid of yet. I have to go through the whole process to actually understand the thing that's going to potentially make them say no, and that's really crucial I think.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):
But once you hear it again, this is such an obviously good idea, clearly not an easy thing to do. In this case where recruiters were upset, is it just get buy-in from folks above, like, "Okay, this sucks for them, but at a macro level, this is good for the business" and they're like, "All right, let's keep doing it"?

Kevin Yien (00:50:55):
At Square, at least, when I first started doing it, luckily I had a very good relationship with them. So that's a good starting point. This is maybe going to come across a little bit flippant, but they can't stop you from sending an email technically. So I'm just going to send the email. And if someone really wants to come and say, "This is bad for business," whatever it is, I have very strong reasons for why that's not the case. And now I've done it so many times, at least, that I can point to very clear proof points on why this is the right path.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:27):
In theory, the incentives would be aligned where the recruiter success matters. It's based on, did they actually have a good time? Did they stay? Did they have good impact?

Kevin Yien (00:51:35):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):
But since they're not, obviously incentives aren't right.

Kevin Yien (00:51:39):
I think some companies have shifted on that, where recruiters and salespeople are compensated sometimes in similar ways in terms of quota and whatnot. And so they'll hold the recruiter accountable to six, 12 post offer tenure before they say, "Oh yeah, you successfully landed this role." So you can tweak the incentive structure a little bit, but not everyone does that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):
Okay. So the advice here is to end up with better people that end up being successful and happy. Keep track of the things that will probably be painful for them at the company, and then craft an email that shares upfront, "Here's what made be a problem if you join, and I just want to be very upfront about it." I think you actually shared a template of one of these emails in one of your blog posts.

Kevin Yien (00:52:25):
Yep, that's right. I have a fairly real one in [inaudible 00:52:30].

Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):
Is there anything else hiring-wise? I know there's probably infinite things that you've done, but is there anything else you think might be worth sharing of things you've learned to be more successful at hiring awesome people?

Kevin Yien (00:52:39):
One final note I'll make on unsell email is it's not as if you just send the email and then they either say yes or no. Most of the time they will say, "Thank you. I am cool with six of these. This one freaks me out. Can we talk more?" Definitely. And I think this is where hiring managers have an incredible responsibility that sometimes isn't taken as seriously as it should, which is, when you are working with someone to get them to join or to offer, you need to bend to do whatever it takes for them. And so if they're like, "Hey, the only time I can talk is tonight at 11 o'clock after my kids go to bed."

(00:53:18):
"No problem. Here's my phone number, let's hop on. I will walk you through whatever you want to talk about." That sort of has to be the place you get to for really strong hires. So that's just one other thing I'll say.

(00:53:29):
The meta point around that is you need to be really invested in the candidates. This probably does change at a certain scale, like if you're "organization" is hiring a hundred engineers or whatever, you have process around it, you have pipelines, there's a machine at that point, but I do think the direct hiring managers have a responsibility to be really involved in every individual, because there's no one who's directly hiring a hundred people. It's always within a number that I think you can take on.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:54:01):
Okay, so this is the final tactic that I heard you're amazing at, which is automating user research. On the surface this sounds amazing. "I'm going to automate my user research. It's going to be amazing. So great." Talk about why you find this really powerful and important. And then how do you actually do this? How do you automate user research? How have you done this on your teams?

Kevin Yien (00:54:17):
Let's start from why this even matters. I think a lot of folks, going back to what is the point of product management, I think there's a similar overlap with UXR, like user experience research, and people will say, "Well, if they're doing research, what do I need to do? I should just be consuming what they're producing to help with that."

(00:54:39):
I know PM should settle for looking through bent glass in my opinion because whether it's a research report, whether it's something a salesperson is telling you, whether it's market research, don't care, it's been processed by someone, and PMs need direct exposure to raw material. End of story. And so that's where I think you just need to constantly be talking to or interacting with whoever is your customer. That's the foundation.

(00:55:08):
So okay, if we all agree on that, then the question is, "Well, I don't have time. It's so hard. How do I find them? My customer success manager says I can't talk to the client." If you are in a situation where the product manager is literally not allowed to talk to a customer, there is something structurally wrong and that needs to be fixed first. So I'm going to ignore that one for now just because that's a whole other rabbit hole, but you need to fix that in order to even get close to the next thing.

(00:55:38):
Okay, now the excuse is going to be, "Well, I don't have time. I don't want to run a program. I don't want to have to query and look up and send out emails every week." There's so many good resources out there right now, and I think that there are... I'll speak mainly from a B2B sense. I think B2C, slightly different story, I don't have as much experience there. But B2B, the two things I will say, one is, there's this thing called userinterviews.com. Shout out to them. They're pretty much user testing but explicitly focused on B2B and you can put in super clear criteria on the type of people you want to talk to. They do the heavy lifting and sourcing it, and then you just review and say, "Yes, yes. No, no," and you can have a steady stream of the exact ICP, you want to go after. ICP is ideal customer profile that you want to go after just coming to you automatically. Amazing.

(00:56:28):
The next one though, it depends on whether or not you have this tooling in place, but the broader theme behind this next category is your sales team is a research team, and if you don't view them that way, you are missing out on half the value. And so there's tools like Gong, which do call recordings, and you can set up filters and alerts for specific terms, phrases, competitors, whatever you want. I don't care what PM you are in the team. You can find the terms that are associated with what you care about the most. Those then get pushed automatically to a Slack channel or otherwise. And then you can set up workflows either via Zappy or something else to say, "Who was the customer? Pull their email, put that into a sequence, drop in my Calendly" and you just have interviews showing up automatically on your calendar. I will say I cannot take credit for this. Shout out to Beth Hills who was a PM that hired at Mutiny. She is the queen of automating customer research and built an amazing system around this.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:28):
So the way it works is you set a term for like, I don't know, POS, point of sale, something in Gong, and if somebody says that or has an issue there, talk about again how that schedules a meeting with you potentially.

Kevin Yien (00:57:42):
Yes. So Gong has an integration with Slack. You set up this alert, it posts to Slack the excerpt of the transcript where it was mentioned along with the user or customer name. So in this case, it'll be Lenny's Burger shop. lenny@lennysburgershop.com, and then you can set up a Zapier to take every new Slack post from that and then send using, I don't know, customer.io in email to that person using that field. And then in that template of the email, drop in your Calendly specifically for user research.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):
Wow, that is genius. I love that. There's another similar tactic that Teresa Torres shared on the podcast in one of the earlier episodes where you have a little popup on your homepage asking people, "Hey, do you want to talk? We'd love to hear feedback on our product. Click here if you want to give us some feedback," and then that schedules Calendly on the PMs.

Kevin Yien (00:58:41):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):
PM's calendar. So you mentioned Gong, customer.io. There's some tools here. Zapier obviously. Is there anything else you find useful to help automate the sort of stuff?

Kevin Yien (00:58:52):
If I take a step back from the automation side or maybe straddle it, depending on the type of business you're in, there's ideally people talking about you somewhere, right? It's either happening on Reddit or Twitter or on some forum or your support forum. There is a community, there's a destination somewhere. And if there isn't, then I don't know, that's too bad. Maybe you don't have product-market fit. If you can take advantage of that, you can usually set up something. And if it's not a Gong or a Zapier, maybe it needs to be just a custom script that you write or you sit down with an engineer to say like, "How do we set up alerting around this thing so that I know when things are happening?"

(00:59:36):
I think you can't use the effort required to do that as an excuse to not be talking to your customers more frequently. Because again, if we go back to a product manager should be trying to convert this potential into kinetic energy, part of that understanding and part of knowing the constraints you can apply is just living in that world as much as possible.

(00:59:59):
The best comparison I can give is, there is a world of difference between reading a report about a lime cook and then standing with a lime cook. You will just pick up on so many ancillary aspects of what their life is like that cannot possibly be communicated in a report. You owe it to yourself as a PM to be exposed to those things all the time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):
In my experience, every time I talk to a customer, I'm always reminded, "Why have I not been doing this more? How can I not be doing this? It's absurd that I haven't done this," like every time you actually do it. But until you do that, you're like, "No, no, I know what they want. I'm reading all the customer service talent issues, I'm reading their emails, I get it." Until you actually talk to them, you're like, "Oh wow, I had no idea."

(01:00:51):
I love that your advice is like, the tactics you're sharing aren't, "Here's how you get a bunch of feedback." From your users, it's like, "Here's how you actually get to talk to the right users." It's like in the end of the funnel talking to a potential customer. It's not just reading a cool... some feedback that they shared.

Kevin Yien (01:01:07):
That's right. I think just like the last point on this one is when you join a new team or start a new role, every PM is budding with energy to do this, "Of course I'm going to talk to my users." But then you reach a point where you go, "No, I know them inside and out. I don't need to talk to them anymore. I can write a PRD in my sleep. And I'm so busy doing both, product improvements, maintenance, annual planning, something else.I can use my intuition from the hundred interviews I've already done. I don't need to do one more interview." And that is a very tempting lie to tell yourself because the world is changing, their lives are changing, and you need to constantly be exposed to those little micro changes in their lives in order to build the product that they'll eventually need.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):
The best explanation I've heard of this is actually from your new boss, Patrick Collison, boss's boss's boss, I don't know how far away you're from him, where he talks about user research and where it fits in. And the way he described it is, instead of doing user research, talking to customers, informing what to build, it's talking to user, talking to customers informs your mental of what the customer needs and then that informs what to build.

Kevin Yien (01:02:23):
100%.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):
Beautiful way to think about it.

(01:02:26):
Okay, so I'm going to take us to a couple recurring themes of this podcast, a couple corners of this room that we have. First of all, I want to go to AI corner, so let's walk over there. Hello, AI corner. I'm curious if you've found any interesting uses of AI in your work or in your life.

Kevin Yien (01:02:46):
There's plenty in work. I don't know if any of them are interesting or novel. I feel like everyone's just figuring it out in real time together. So I'll actually take us in a slightly different direction. And this may be isn't directly useful to product managers, but I think it's a really good story.

(01:03:02):
So when Midjourney V1 was released, if we can remember that far back, it was at least I got beta access on a Saturday. And for what's worth, I have three daughters, one of them's seven years old, and so her and I were awake. We were waiting for the other two to wake up and I was like, "Oh, I have this cool new thing. Do you want to play with me?" And she goes, "Of course." So we log in, we create an account and I type in the first prompt, image gets generated, it's like a rainbow or something. And then I ask her, "Do you want to try it?" She goes, "Of course." So she types in unicorn prancing in a field and it generates this hideous looking demented unicorn with two rear ends and a demon flying over it. And I'm appalled at first thinking that she's going to feel really bad about what she got shown, but instead I look over and she's in awe. She is amazed.

(01:04:04):
And then she turns to me and she goes, "Did I draw that?"

(01:04:06):
"Yeah, I guess you did." And the thing that I got hung up on was that she used the word draw. She didn't say, "Oh, I enter a prompt and the LLM produced this thing," or whatever weird terminology that all of us use. It's like, "Did I draw that?" I don't know when it clicked for me, but at some point in time after that I was like, "The concept of these image generation models is the same as a crayon to her. There is no difference in her mind." And that is an insane change that I can't even comprehend. And so for me that's just been I think an experience that I go back to when I think about people asking, "What do you think AI is going to do and what's the next thing? And is it chat or is it something else?" I cannot comprehend what a child who grew up with a crayon of an LLM is going to think is a good product in 20 years. I need to start crying. But goddammit, I have no freaking clue.

(01:05:11):
And so I think I have a cheat code actually as a parent, because I get to see how they evolve and use these tools in real time. But all I can say is we are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:29):
Wow, that is an amazing story, it gave me tingles. It makes me think a little bit about how we used to code in binary and then assembly and now it's Java, and then I don't know, all the languages, Python. And now it's like AI, LLM generating code and it's the same thing for drawing potentially. It used to be sticks on a cave and then became crayons and pens and iPads and all that stuff. And now it's again LLMs, so that's pretty bonkers. Amazing story. Thanks for sharing that. Useful to PMs and non PMs alike.

(01:06:06):
Okay, I'm going to take you to another recurring corner/segment of the podcast, fail corner. I'm curious if there's a story of failure that you can share of something that didn't go the way you wanted and still had a positive impact on your life or career?

Kevin Yien (01:06:25):
Well, there's countless stories of failure, but I'll choose the one that I think I've had to reference the most with people and has been to date the most difficult one to really talk about. I'm on the other end of it, and so now it's very easy, but it took several years to get there.

(01:06:44):
So context, I'm [inaudible 01:06:47] my way to PM, I land my first official, by title, PM job at a startup. I made it. I've arrived. I'm officially a product manager. And we go up, we go down, all the things happen. Fast-forward, the company is really struggling and so we go through a series of rolling layoffs and I'm round 4 something. At that point in time, my wife was nine months pregnant with our first child, and so I am freaking out. There is the personal side that I'm worried about, but then there's also my identity that has been completely crushed, because in the moment all I could think was, "I thought I was a product manager. This is evidence I am not," and I couldn't get past that.

(01:07:37):
And so for what it's worth, this is the one post I have on my website that I actually feel really, really proud of. It's called Finding Swagger. I can talk about why it's titled that way, but it's the thing that I really wrote more for myself because it's a good reminder to me every time I fall into this mentality again, because that may have been the first time that I really had the feelings of, "I'm not worth it" or, "I'm not meant to be this person," but it's recurred several times since then over the past decade. And when I read back through my mentality of how I got to the other end of it, it helps even myself sort of get back on the horse.

(01:08:28):
So okay, I get laid off, I'm distraught, I have no purpose, I'm nothing. And it was through a lot of reflection, a lot of conversation with friends and my wife where you eventually need to convince yourself that there is a difference between you not being good at something and a business or company not needing that thing at a particular moment in time, or you being very good at something but not in the way that a company needs.

(01:09:01):
And so I think once I was able to get to that, Square for me was the immediate subsequent role that I took on. And I went into that thing just full steam ahead, I'm going to prove myself. "I know I'm good," because I think I'm good, "and I am going to prove the hell out of that" mainly to myself, but ideally to other people too.

(01:09:24):
I think you shouldn't do things for other people for validation, but the initial success I got to see in launching a product, gaining the trust of my peers, having something that restaurants were texting me about, saying, "I can start my restaurant because of this. I didn't go down during rush hour because of this," that gave me the validation to say, "Okay, I am competent at this thing called product management." And then from there you can continue to build and continue to grow.

(01:09:53):
But I think right now, the market's weird, right? The market's wonky. There's a lot of really good talent that is just getting hit over sideways. I have a lot of friends that are having the same mental conversations around, "Well, I guess I'm just not worth it. I guess I wasn't cut out actually to do this job, do this role, be of this purpose." In some cases, maybe that's true and you can sort of have a career transition or a pivot in your life, but I think it's worthwhile to reflect on what are the things that were in your control that you can now change moving forward? And then what are the things that were truly out of your control that you can now apply to find a better fit? And that's one of the big things that I've been able to, I think, come around to.

(01:10:41):
And it's really hard because early on I think it's very tempting to associate a lot of different things with your identity. You're like, "I'm a startup guy. I'm a PM, I'm a fast whatever, I'm a fast thinker." And when an event happens that pokes at that part of your identity, the rest of it crumbles. And so long story short, I think it's really important for folks to use these moments where it feels bad and feels like a failure to reevaluate what parts are actually part of your identity and which parts are in your control to change in whatever you do next.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):
Wow, what an important and great story. As you mentioned, a lot of people are dealing with finding it hard to find a new gig and a bunch of layoffs. I think this is going to help a lot of people. The two categories you shared I think are especially powerful. So the advice here is just separate, "This company just doesn't need someone with my skills right now" from, "I'm not good at these skills." Can you just share those two kind of things that might be true that you may not be recognizing about why they maybe laid you off again?

Kevin Yien (01:11:52):
Totally. So one is the business just doesn't have a need for you. They got ahead of their skis and that's their fault. They probably admit that, but that's not up to you. The second one though is my skills and the way that company operates are not compatible. This one I think is really, really important because I've seen so many times where there's been a PM engineer, designer, whatever role, they cannot make it work at company A, and then you see them five years later just killing it in company B and you're like, "Did they change as a person? Did they get super good at what they were bad at before?" Maybe a little bit, but honestly it was just a change in environment. And when you find the right environment in the right role, you just flourish.

(01:12:40):
And I think this is actually... Sorry, we'll go back to hiring for just a moment or at least management.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:12:44):
Please.

Kevin Yien (01:12:45):
This is why performance conversations can always feel so difficult because it seems like you're telling someone you are bad, and as the recipient you're like, "I am bad." No one wants to hear that. But the reality is, you are not bad. It is that maybe the way that your environment is working, the machine that you exist as a part of, is not the kind that you thrive in. And so it's within your control to decide, "I'm going to change how I work to fit that environment" or, "I'm going to find a different environment that actually fits the way I work much better." And that's empowering.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):
I think that also applies a lot to interviewing. A lot of times you interview, don't get the job, and you exactly feel like, "Oh, I'm just not good enough." But really that company's way of working just may not gel with the way you operate. Like Uber operates very differently from Airbnb, operates very differently from Google. And so it's not that necessarily something you're doing wrong, they just don't think you're fit.

(01:13:46):
And this connects to something. I just had another guest on the podcast. He was a brain science dude, and he talks about how every company has this kind of habitat. What habitat are you creating for your employees to enable them to think differently or to be shut down and not feel like they can be creative or try big things or not? And basically, the way he just kind of to leverage that metaphor, like you may be a palm tree and you're trying to join Antarctica and it's not going to go well.

Kevin Yien (01:14:16):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):
You got to find Palm Springs or some hard place. Kevin, this has been amazing. Okay, so before we get to very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think is important or valuable to share, leave listeners with? And if not, absolutely.

Kevin Yien (01:14:30):
I think we'll probably find ourselves on interesting detours to the lightning round, so let's roll in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:35):
Kevin, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kevin Yien (01:14:39):
Hell, yeah. Let's do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):
Let's do it. Question one, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Kevin Yien (01:14:46):
I'll start by saying the type of book by volume that I read and get the most joy from are autobiographies and memoirs. It is just the ultimate cheat code to spend time with people that you respect, are interested by, or want to learn from.

(01:15:05):
Could you imagine what it would take in real life to sit down with Albert Einstein for 50 hours and just have him talk to you about his life? Impossible. But you can read and pretty much get the same thing.

(01:15:21):
So anyways, strong requirement or a strong suggestion, go read autobiographies and memoirs of people that you respect, mostly for their mental model and way to approach thinking, less about specific things. But the one book that I read without fail every year has a very misleading title. It's called The Courage to Be Disliked. I think it's been mentioned previously on the podcast, but it covers... It's a very Socratic method style, so it's about a philosopher and a young person, and it tries to teach you the ways of Adlerian psychology, which is sort of counter to Jungian theory.

(01:15:56):
The reason I really like it is because it makes me uncomfortable. So the whole premise, in my opinion, behind the book and other in psychology is focus on what you control. That's the one line. Don't worry about everything else. Don't worry about what other people think. Don't worry about what other people do. You cannot control those. You focus on yourself and you focus on the actions you can take. And be the person that you think will attract other people, that you want to be around.

(01:16:29):
There's some really pointed notes in there that I'm like, "Ha-ha-ha-ha. I don't fully agree with that one," but it always pushes me to question something about what I believe. And so in every physical copy of a book I have, I write the date that I started reading it again. The front inside cover of this book, I think it's been seven or eight years at this point that I've read it every single year.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):
Wow. It's like a decision logging in another context almost.

Kevin Yien (01:16:59):
Yeah, a little bit. I would say the other book I was going to mention is The Paper Menagerie. This actually shout out to Sean Rose for... I've never met him, but I really appreciate Sean. He was one of the early, if not, first PMs of Slack, and he used to be really loud on Twitter in a very good way, and I think I learned a ton from stuff that he would post. But one of the things that he posted was this book. It is just the most beautiful collection of essays that span sci-fi and fantasy. And so if you're into that kind of stuff, if you like exhalation, then Paper Menagerie is even better.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):
Oh, shit. Guess I got to add this book to my list. I do love exhalation.

Kevin Yien (01:17:43):
There you go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):
Oh, man, this job is tough. I get to learn all these amazing books and then I got to read them, but I don't have time. Hard.

(01:17:51):
Speaking of more time, next question. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you really enjoyed?

Kevin Yien (01:17:57):
There's less time for either these days. I will say not novel, the Bear holds a very special place in my heart right now, both because I worked in restaurants and I got to build for them. And so seeing the details that they do actually gives me a lot of anxiety, but I really appreciate the craft they put into it.

(01:18:16):
The other show, actually, I think this is the first time, Physical 100. So this is a Netflix show. It's a Korean show about a hundred different bodybuilders, athletes, what have you, on who has the optimum physique or whatever. I don't really care about that part. The two things I love about the show are, one, it's ridiculous what people are capable of. You see what they can physically do and you're like, "Oh my God, that's amazing what they can put their minds to." The other part though, and this is maybe a trend of Korean shows that I've noticed, is the amount of respect they have in this competition is bar none. You have this guy who is historically famous, was the top champion in judo or something, and you have all these other athletes that are 15, 20 years younger, and they're bowing and just humble to compete against the guy. I kind of wish that more American Joes had that level of respect as opposed to just trying to find the most conflict. There's something that I really like about that.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:25):
That's beautiful. I've started that show, but I haven't continued it, so I'm going to revisit it.

Kevin Yien (01:19:30):
Cool.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:19:30):
Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kevin Yien (01:19:34):
We got a really old 2002 Jeep to work on with my daughters, just like a true junker. And as a result of that, we're repairing it. We're taking off the rust, replacing parts, and so there's these little magnetic trays that you can hold screws and nails and whatnot, so they don't go flying and rolling around everywhere. It's stupidly useful when you're working on a car. And the girls love it because they can use it for other things like collecting hair clips or whatever else. So magnetic trays, shout out.

(01:20:06):
And then selfishly, I will say my buddy Arjun Mahanti has an app called Circuit. If you search the app store for Circuit, like C-I-R-C-U-I-T, HIIT timer, it's such a delightful little app that lets you track Tabata sex or whatever else to just get a little workout in.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):
Super cool. Magnetic tray is not boring at all. That is extremely cool and it has a really cool story too. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful to share with friends and family in work or in life?

Kevin Yien (01:20:36):
I think we've actually maybe touched on both of these. I'll cheat and I'll pull one from maybe each parent so that in case they see this, they don't feel like I'm favoring one of them.

(01:20:45):
So my mom's side, I think something that she would always repeat to me growing up is everything happens for a reason. I hated that growing up because she only said it when something bad would happen. Something bad happens, she goes, "Everything happens for a reason," and I'm like, "No, it doesn't. Life just sucks." And to no surprise at this point in the conversation, I've now grown to really, really appreciate that piece of advice because what it's actually trying to communicate is, when something happens, good or bad, frankly, don't dwell on it. That's the past. Focus on what you want to do and then just move towards that. And then in most cases, you'll be able to look back in one, five, 10 years and connect the dots in a way where the story makes sense in your mind. And so just having that shift in perspective I think has helped me a lot to not overreact to anything that happens in my life. So that's one side.

(01:21:46):
And then on my dad's side, so the funny origins of this, unsurprising to anyone with Asian parents, I'm a spunky little 7-year-old, I come home with my math test one day. I got 97%. I think that's pretty good. I go show it to my dad with beaming eyes and pride. He sort of stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?"

Lenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):
Oh, my God.

Kevin Yien (01:22:10):
I'm just distraught and I sulk away. I'm very sad. I study hard. I do the next math test, I get 100% yes. All right, dad's approval, here we come. I come flying back, I put the test in his hands, he stares down his nose at it, looks at me, "Where's my other 3%?" I'm so confused. I'm like, "I got 100 out of 100. I have no clue what you're talking about." He just looks me down the eye and goes, "Who said a hundred is the most you can get?" At that age, I literally had no clue what he was talking about. And he had to reframe it for me in the moment around like, "Well, was there extra credit? Can you just write your own problems to challenge yourself more? Could you have given yourself another test? And maybe the teacher won't give you credit, but you give yourself credit for doing additional work."

(01:23:01):
I think I carry that theme forward where there's this weird transition we all go through from childhood to adulthood where we no longer receive homework, we're responsible for defining the work that we do. And when you do that, if all you do is the minimum of what defined the 100% of what your job requires, you'll never grow. And so it's up to you to actually find what is the additional 3%? There's always three more percent. So that's my dad's lesson.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):
Kevin, you're blowing my mind. There's so many great stories, you're just full of them. And I feel like this lesson also applies really well to product and building product and founding companies.

Kevin Yien (01:23:46):
Totally.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):
Just pushing further than people expect and making it a lot more delightful than the minimum bar.

(01:23:53):
Final question, speaking of things that maybe people don't expect and may not understand is possible, looking at you, nobody would've guessed that you're a competitive eater at some point in your life. As a final question, tell us about this part of your life. What did you eat? How does this work? How far did you get in this path?

Kevin Yien (01:24:12):
It's probably misleading to say that I was a true competitive eater. I wasn't on the circuit with a... I forget his name, but Johnny Chestnut.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):
[inaudible 01:24:21]. Oh yeah, Chestnut

Kevin Yien (01:24:22):
Back in the day, that's like the OG competitive eater on the hotdog circuit, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:25):
Right.

Kevin Yien (01:24:26):
For me it was more eating challenges. And so whenever I would travel, I would find the local eating challenge, whether it was time-based, volume-based, something else, and just try to see what I could push my body to do. I was blessed with a great metabolism, so I never really had to worry too much about anything else. And the origin, the first moment of this was when I was 14, my sister was going to college in Minnesota and there's this steakhouse up there called Manny's, which is where the Vikings Frontline goes to after every game. And they have this ridiculous 97 ounce order house. I don't know how many pounds that is, but it's too much meat for a human to consume.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:24:26):
97 ounce.

Kevin Yien (01:25:07):
97 ounces, yeah. And so I sit down, I order it thinking, "This is going to be great." They put it in front of me, it's a monster. You have to eat in under an hour. And so 45 minutes into it, I'm halfway through and about to die. And the catch is, if you finish it in under an hour, you get it for free. And so my dad again leans in and goes, "You can't afford not to finish this."

(01:25:39):
And so, "Message received, sir." Hunker down. I plowed the other half in 15 minutes. I then slept for I think three days afterwards. But after that I was like, "Oh my God, if I could do that, what else could I do?" And so, [inaudible 01:25:54] carried for, I don't know, nearly a decade of trying to do these interesting challenges.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):
Wow. I don't know how that's physically possible, but clearly you did it.

(01:26:02):
Kevin, this has been wonderful. I think there's so many lessons here for people in so many ways, life and work and parenting. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow you and learn more from you over time? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Kevin Yien (01:26:17):
I'm on Twitter, just @kevinyien. Technically, I'm on LinkedIn. I don't post over there. I probably should. I hear it's very good. But that's where you can find me. Also, my website. I don't write that often, and I don't have an RSS feed, which has always been on my backlog, and I'm always too lazy to do. But one day I will add it.

(01:26:38):
One quick note, I'll actually make on websites. So on one hand, I love all the different website builders that exist. It's amazing what we've enabled anyone to be able to do. There is something really special about having your corner of the internet that you built sort of hand by hand, line by line. And so my website is, it's a GitHub page. It's hosts on GitHub pages, but it's just raw HTML, CSS, nothing fancy. I get so much joy every year just doing a slight tweak or cleaning of it. And so I really do recommend that for anyone with the curiosity and the desire to buy your domain, even if you're never going to write anything on it, you're never going to share it out, just own a little piece of the internet. It feels good.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:28):
I love that. I didn't know that about your website. And I could see it now as I go there. It's .html, which you don't see as much anymore.

Kevin Yien (01:27:35):
Exactly. [inaudible 01:27:37].

Lenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):
And then... Yeah, can listeners be useful to you.

Kevin Yien (01:27:39):
This is going to sound trite, and it has nothing to do with product necessarily, just be kind. Make for a nicer world, right? Say thank you a little bit more often. Hold the door open a little more often. Wave if you cut someone off in a car. I think there is a temptation and incentive structure to create conflict intention. And in most cases, the world would just benefit from a little bit more kindness.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:28:06):
What an incredibly beautiful way its ended. Kevin, this was so much fun. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you so much for coming on.

Kevin Yien (01:28:13):
Thank you for having me.

## Transcript

Kim Scott (00:00:00):
If you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" Do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:00:33):
Today my guest is Kim Scott. Kim is the author of Radical Candor, which is the single most referenced book on this podcast. The book has sold over 1 million copies, has been translated into twenty-three languages. It was such an honor to have Kim on the podcast. Prior to this book, Kim was a CO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrics, Twitter and many other tech companies. She was a member of the faculty at Apple University. Before that, she led AdSense, YouTube and DoubleClick teams at Google. Prior to that, Kim managed a pediatric clinic in Kosovo and started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow. She's also working on a new book that you can pre-order now called Radical Respect. In our conversation, we get very practical and very tactical about practicing radical candor. Kim briefly describes the core idea, shares, language and phrases and words you can use to get better at practicing radical candor.

(00:01:24):
She shares tips for people-pleasers like myself. Also, a lot of very concrete advice for how to get feedback. Also, what to do if your culture is on the ruinous empathy side of the spectrum, or even worse, obnoxious aggression and so much more. I guarantee listening to this episode will make you a better leader and a better employee. With that, I bring you Kim Scott after a short word from our one featured sponsor for this episode.

(00:01:50):

(00:03:13):
Kim, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:17):
Thank you for having me. I'm excited for our conversation.

Lenny (00:03:20):
Your book, Radical Candor is the single most recommended book on this podcast. I don't know if you know this podcast well, but at the end of the podcast, I ask every guest, "What are two or three books you recommend most to other people?" And your book has come up the most of any book mentioned on the podcast.

Kim Scott (00:03:37):
Amazing. Well, tell your listeners I love them and I'm grateful to them.

Lenny (00:03:45):
Okay, they'll hear this. So I'm really excited to have you on chat about all the things that you teach and your book. For people that have heard the term Radical Candor, have maybe skimmed the book, maybe even read the book a while ago, but don't truly remember or understand the concept. Could you just spend just a few minutes giving a high level overview of the concept of Radical Candor?

Kim Scott (00:04:04):
Absolutely. Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, "In the spirit of Radical Candor," and then they act like a garden variety jerk.

(00:05:00):
And that is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That's the spirit of obnoxious aggression. And obnoxious aggression is a big problem. It's a problem because it hurts other people. It's also a problem because it's inefficient. If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.

(00:05:48):
And it's kind of fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read.

Lenny (00:06:40):
Amazing and we'll link to a diagram of this two by two for people that aren't visual thinkers and want to actually see it. So just to make it super clear, if you're challenging directly, basically being very candid with feedback, but it's not clear you care deeply about the person, you call that obnoxious aggression.

Kim Scott (00:06:40):
Yes.

Lenny (00:06:57):
And if you make it clear, you care a lot about the person but aren't actually giving them direct candid feedback, you call that ruinous empathy.

Kim Scott (00:07:05):
Yes, exactly.

Lenny (00:07:06):
Which of these buckets do you find most people fall into? Is there a percentage of people or companies?

Kim Scott (00:07:11):
Yeah, I mean, I would say 90% of us make 90% of our mistakes in that ruinous empathy bucket. It's by far and away the most common problem. But I think all of us make mistakes in the other quadrants as well. And very often we kind of, I think one of, if I'm going to offer some self-criticism of this framework, it's much easier to notice when one has been ruinously empathetic. It's almost like, give yourself some critical feedback. "I work too hard." But it's much harder to notice when we've been manipulatively insincere and obnoxiously aggressive. And maybe I could have named those things because very often manipulative insincerity is sort of self-protective insincerity. Very often obnoxious aggression is just extreme frustration. So I want people to use this framework not to judge themselves or other people harshly, but like a compass to guide specific conversations with specific people to a better place and to help us understand when we're going in the wrong direction, which we are all bound to do on a daily basis.

Lenny (00:08:26):
I want to talk about all those things and also how to get better at these things. But before we do that, it's very hard to change. And it's also hard just to challenge directly innately, it's hard for people to be candid, just to give people a little motivation to invest in this skill. What sort of impact do you see when people develop the skill of being better at radical candor?

Kim Scott (00:08:48):
When we get better at radical candor? I mean, I'll tell you a story in fact about the impact it had on my life, some radical candor, but the sort of abstract answer to your question is we build better relationships and we do better work and we're more successful and we're happier. You ready for a story? Let's do it. Love stories. Okay. So shortly after I joined Google, this was now a very long time ago, 2004, I had to give a presentation to the founders and the CEO about how the AdSense business was doing. And I walked into the room and there in one corner of the room was one of the founders on an elliptical trainer wearing toe shoes and a bright blue spandex unitard, super tight, not what I was expecting or frankly wanting to see in the room. And there in the other corner of the room was the CEO doing his emails like his brain had been plugged into the machine.

(00:09:49):
So probably like you in such a situation, I felt a little bit nervous. How was I supposed to get these people's attention? Luckily for me, the AdSense business was on fire. And when I said how many new customers we had added, the CEO almost fell off his chair. "What did you say? This is incredible. Do you need more engineers? Do you need more marketing dollars?" So I'm thinking the meeting's going all right. In fact, I now believe that I am a genius. And I walked out of the room, I walked past my boss and I was expecting a high five a pat on the back. And instead she said to me, "Why don't you walk back to my office with me?" And I thought, Oh gosh, I screwed something up in there and I'm sure I'm about to hear about it. And she began not by telling me what I had done wrong, but what had gone well in the meeting, not in the feedback sandwich.

(00:10:37):
I think there's a less polite term for that. I'm not sure how you feel about cussing on your podcast.

Lenny (00:10:37):
It's acceptable, fully acceptable.

Kim Scott (00:10:43):
Not in the shit sandwich since the word, but really seeming to mean what she said. But of course, all I wanted to do was hear about what I had done wrong. And eventually she said to me, "You said um a lot in there, were you aware of it?" And with this, I braved a huge sigh of relief if that was all I had done wrong who really cared. And I kind of made this brush off gesture with my hand. I said, "Yeah, I know, it's a verbal tech. It's no big deal, really." And then she said to me, "I know this great speech coach. I bet Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?" And once again, I made this brush off gesture with my hand.

(00:11:14):
I said, "Oh, I'm busy. I don't have time for a speech coach. Didn't you hear about all these new customers?" And then she said to me, "I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid." Now she's got my full attention. And some people might say it was mean of her to say I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the kindest thing that she could have done for me at that moment in my career because she knew me well enough to know that if she didn't use just those words with me, and by the way, this is a really important point, she never would've used those words with other people on her team who were perhaps a better listener than I was.

(00:11:56):
But she knew me well enough. She cared personally enough to know that if she didn't use those words with me, I never would've gone to visit the speech coach and I wouldn't have learned that she was not exaggerating. And this was news to me because I had raised millions of dollars for two different startups giving presentations. I thought I was pretty good at it. And it really got me to thinking sort of why had no one told me. It was almost like I suddenly realized I'd been marching through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach in between my teeth and nobody had had the common courtesy to tell me it was there. So why had no one else told me. But what was it about her leadership style that made it so seemingly easy for her to tell me? And as I thought about that, I realized it really came down to those two things.

(00:12:41):
She cared personally and she challenged directly. She cared about me not just as an employee but as a human being. For example, when my father was diagnosed with late stage cancer, I was devastated and she could tell that I was devastated. And she said, "Kim, look, you go to the airport, fly home to Memphis, you need to be with your family. Your team and I will sit down and write your coverage plan." That's what great teams do for one another. And those were the kinds of things, that was the kind of thing that she did. She couldn't do, of course, for all 5,000 people in her organization, no matter how talented you are, relationships don't scale. But she did do those things for her direct reports and the people who she worked most closely with, all of us.

(00:13:27):
And when a leader treats their team, the people who they interact with on a day-to-day basis with that kind of real care, then it's much more likely that their direct reports in turn are going to treat their teams with real care. And that creates a culture of caring. And even though relationships don't scale, culture does scale. So that was part of it. But of course there's also this challenge directly part which is equally as important. And I learned very quickly beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I screwed up, she was going to tell me and she was going to keep telling me until it penetrated my sometimes thick skull.

Lenny (00:14:07):
I had a manager that was also very good at this. He was very good at just giving me very direct feedback, and I knew that he was only doing it because he cared about my future. To kind of follow this thread and get a little tactical, is there language or phrases or ways of communicating that you recommend people use to either challenge directly and avoid people getting defensive or make it clear you care deeply?

Kim Scott (00:14:31):
People always want me to give them a script. And the problem with the script is that if I write it, you're going to sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself. And then people won't really think you mean what you're saying. But I do think there are some important things to consider when having these conversations. I think you want to go into the conversation, and by the way, everything I'm about to say applies to praise as much as it does to criticism. And I want to pause for a moment. That story is helpful because that's the kind of thing that has happened to so many of us, that's not unique to me. However, praise is even more important than criticism in terms of radical candor. Radical candor is not all about the boss giving the employee criticism. It should always start with soliciting feedback and it should include more praise and criticism, but anyway, way without offering up shit sandwiches.

(00:15:31):
So anyway, I think that the important thing for these conversations, these sort of two-minute impromptu moments of management, is to go into the conversation being humble. To me, I call it candor and not truth because if I march into a room and I say, "Lenny, I'm going to tell you the truth." I'm kind of implying I've got a pipeline to God and you don't know anything. And that's not what this is all about. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. So to me, candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also curious to know how you understand the conversation. So you want to go in being humble, you might be wrong, and that's totally fine. Omniscience is not a requirement for radical candor, thank heavens. So you want to be humble. You want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to remember in your own head and you want to make it explicit to the other person that you're telling them this to help them.

(00:16:25):
You're not trying to be dominant or kick them in the shins or anything like that. You're telling them this because you care about them. So you want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to have these conversations right away, almost immediately. I mean, there's exceptions to everything I'm saying. None of this is absolute. But usually if I'm telling myself and Lenny, you can tell me if you have the same problem, but if I tell myself, Oh, I'm going to wait for a better moment to tell this person this thing, what I'm really saying is I'm never going to say. So if the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and the purpose of criticism is to tell them what to do less of, why wait. So you want to do it immediately unless you are so upset that you're going to say it in a terrible way or the other person is so upset that they can't hear you. But usually that's not the case.

(00:17:16):
You also want, and in the before times I used to say have these conversations in person. Now I say have these conversations synchronously and I'm going to recommend phone over video. There's a lot of evidence coming out of University of Chicago and probably other places, but that's the article I've read that there's more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language, especially if somebody is just a little square on a computer screen. But it also may be true in real life, like the phone actually may be one of our best communication innovations of all time because when you're talking to someone on the phone, you're listening to the words that they are saying to you, and that is really what you want to do in this moment. So make sure that you're having these conversations synchronously, because what you want to do next is gauge how it's landing.

(00:18:15):
So I'll talk about that in a minute. And you can't gauge how something is landing if you're sending an email or a text, and Slack is just a feedback train wreck waiting to happen. I once coached someone who kept giving feedback over Slack and I finally just quit coaching him. I was like, "If you keep making this mistake, I can't be your coach." So don't do that. Take a moment to pick up the phone and call the person. Go back to those old AT&T commercials when I was a kid. Reach out and touch someone. You want to show you care.

(00:18:52):
So let's review. You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count.

(00:19:21):
And so let's double-click though on this not about personality point. I think it's really important to remember that for both praise and criticism, you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, result, it made you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE, you can think about that as CORE. I used to call it CORN, but I got some feedback that corn is like some shorthand for porn on TikTok. So I call it CORE instead, HIP CORE.

Lenny (00:20:16):
Wow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. So the E at the end stands for?

Kim Scott (00:20:20):
Next step, big E.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Oh, I see the E is the next, you skipped the N, clever.

Kim Scott (00:20:26):
Yes. I don't know, clever or ridiculous. Maybe I should just call it HIP CORN,

Lenny (00:20:31):
Right? No, I think either one's great. So you share this example of the speaking example. Maybe if we can do another example just to reinforce this framework.

Kim Scott (00:20:43):
Let's do a little ruinous empathy.

Lenny (00:20:47):
Okay, great. Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:20:47):
How about that? That is the mistake. I think that I am really focused in the book Radical Candor and also in my next book Radical Respect. That's the mistake I really want to eliminate.

Lenny (00:21:00):
Let's do it.

Kim Scott (00:21:00):
Because ruinous empathy creates this false harmony, which is really bad. So here's my ruinous empathy story. I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob, and I liked Bob a lot. He was smart, he was charming, he was funny. He would do stuff like we're at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get to know you games. And everybody was getting more and more and more stressed out. So start up, we've got a lot going on. And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand and to say, "I can tell everyone is getting stressed. I want to get to know all of you. I've got an idea. It'll help us do that and it'll be really fast."

(00:21:41):
Whatever his idea was, if it was really fast, we were down with it. And Bob says, "Let's just go around the table and confess what candy our parents used when potty training us." Really weird but really fast. And then for the next 10 months, every time there was a tense moment in a meeting, Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy for the right person at the right moment. And we all remember that was the weirder thing. Like Hershey Kisses right here. That was what my parents used to potty train me.

(00:22:16):
And so Bob was quirky, but he brought a little levity to the office. Everybody kind of loved working with Bob. There was one problem with Bob. He was doing terrible work. He would hand stuff into me and there was shame in his eyes. He kind of knew it wasn't good enough. He was very creative, but riddled with sloppy mistakes. And I would say something to Bob along the lines of, "Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better." So let's pause for a moment. Why did I say such a banal thing to Bob? I think part of the problem was that I liked Bob and I really didn't want to hurt his feelings.

(00:23:05):
So that was the ruinous empathy part of why I said that. But also part of the problem was something more insidious, a little bit of manipulative insincerity, because Bob was popular and Bob was also sensitive kind of. And there was part of me that was afraid if I told Bob in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough, he would get upset. He might even start to cry and then everybody would think I was a big, you know what? So the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader, that was the manipulative insincerity part, the part of me that was worried about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part. And this went on for 10 months, 10 long months, and I was so puzzled the whole time I couldn't understand what was going on. I learned much later that one of the issues perhaps was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom three times a day, which maybe explained all that candy that he had at all times.

(00:24:11):
But I didn't know any of that at the time. All I knew is that Bob was consistently doing bad work, but I wasn't really dealing with it. And eventually the inevitable happened. I realized that if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work.

(00:24:46):
And the people who were best at their jobs were going to quit because they wanted to be able to do their best work. They were going to go to a different company where they could do their best work. And so I sat down to have a conversation with Bob that I should have begun frankly 10 months previously. And when I finished explaining to him where things stood, he kind of pushed his chair back from the table. He looked me right in the eye and he said, "Why didn't you tell me?" And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said, "Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me." And now I realized that by not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all. But it was too late to say Bob because at this point even he agreed he should go because his reputation on the team was just shot.

(00:25:46):
All I could do in the moment was make myself a very solemn promise that I would never make that mistake again, and that I would do everything in my power to help other people avoid making that mistake. It was so painful. It was painful for me. It was painful for Bob, much more painful for Bob actually, and it was bad for the whole team and it was bad for our investors. We weren't getting results because of my ruinous empathy and ruinous empathy slash manipulative insincerity. It's much harder to admit the manipulative insincerity part. And that is really why I'm here talking to you because I want all of your listeners to avoid making that mistake because it's the most painful and the most common mistake that I think leaders and not just leaders, I mean all of us make this mistake in all of our relationships.

Lenny (00:26:41):
I love that this also gives an example of the impact of getting better at this point of you'll lose not just the people that are not necessarily great, but also other high performers on the team because they're seeing people slip through the cracks that aren't amazing. And if you're not practicing this early, your team basically becomes not high performing.

Kim Scott (00:27:00):
Yeah, exactly. You're going to lose your top performers. And I think very often people are afraid to tell someone on their team when their work isn't good enough because they're afraid of losing them. But that's not a good reason. You should be helping this person to improve. This person deserves to have a job where they can excel and you either help them excel on this team or you help them find a different job where they can excel, because everyone can do great work somewhere. And Bob could have done great work. Maybe I would've helped him keep it to the weekends because he's very creative and very smart, but the floppy mistakes just got in the way of his ability to do his best work.

Lenny (00:27:50):
So following that thread, I imagine the reason you didn't tell him early, and most people don't do this well, is many people are, you can maybe call them people pleasers. I'm a recovering people pleaser, I'll say. It's just hard to give people hard feedback. You want people to like you. It's not a natural state for a lot of people. What do you find helps people get over this kind of need to be liked as a leader and helps them be more candid?

Kim Scott (00:28:15):
I think that one of the things that was helpful for me anyway, so you can tell me if it's helpful for you, was realizing that my job was not to be liked. My job was to care about other people and to get out of my own head and to become others focused is what helped me kind of let go of the need to be liked. I think that also as a woman, I think there was something extra, as my teenage children would say, there was something extra for me because the sort of likability- competence bias that a lot of women face pushed me, especially early in my career, in the wrong direction on challenge directly.

(00:29:04):
And it made it much harder for me to, because often I would say something and I would say it even more gently than my colleagues who were men, but people would say, "Ah, Kim is a real whatever." And they weren't saying, Kim is obnoxious. I was being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression and it wasn't obnoxious or they were accusing me of being bossy or or abrasive or whatever. And it's really hard. I would also say when it comes to eliciting feedback, it's really important to be open to it and it's really important to separate the wheat from the chaff from the feedback you're getting.

Lenny (00:29:41):
So in this example of Bob, say you were to do it now, what would you do differently other than give him feedback earlier? Is there something you've learned about just how you would've phrased it or approached it?

Kim Scott (00:29:58):
I think probably what I would do, and I would love to hear what you would've said to Bob too, I certainly don't have all the answers, but probably what I would've said is let's go back to the first time Bob handed work into me with shame in his eyes. I would've said, "Bob, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression on your face, but it looks to me like you are not happy with this. What's going on?" And so I would've asked him to diagnose it himself and I want to pause on that because that can be very risky. He might have said to me, "I think this is awesome. This is my best work," and now I've kind of made my job of giving him feedback a little bit harder. So it's not always the right thing to ask questions, but I would've tried to ask it before I had examined the work when I noticed that he looked uncomfortable himself.

(00:30:47):
And I think also another thing I've learned about noticing, I said earlier that there's a lot of evidence that we often misinterpret each other's facial expressions and body language. So I would've tried to say that with some humility, it seems like you're not, maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look to me like you're happy with this. And I would've given him an opportunity to say, "Yeah, maybe I need to do it again." Let's imagine though that he said, "Oh no, it's awesome. It's ready." So then I get it and I look at it. I would have not been shy about pointing out very specifically every problem that I saw in that piece of work, every single one. Sometimes it can be tempting when you're giving someone feedback to say, "Oh, there's a number of careless mistakes here. Can you go back and look at it again," and the person will notice a few of them and then you got to go, sometimes it's useful to show someone a pattern.

(00:31:53):
All of the careless mistakes, especially if someone is defensive or if you think they're likely to be defensive, if you think they're likely to do to you what I did to my boss, oh no, everything's fine. It's no big deal. You need to move out on the challenge directly dimension. You need to be prepared to keep going until you have communicated with a person. And that was really the problem with Bob. He probably would not have started to cry. I think my fear around his tears was probably more about my fear than what was actually likely to happen. But I think we do fear someone else getting upset more often than they actually get upset. We have kind of a negativity bias when it comes to part of the reason why we're reluctant to give feedback.

Lenny (00:32:42):
And I think to your point, that we want to be liked, like you said, that you should get over that. I think that's obviously very hard just to be like, "Nah, I'm not going to worry about that." But I think your point is really important that you'll be liked later if you don't do the hard thing now. It'll only get worse if you just let it continue happening.

Kim Scott (00:33:01):
And I think also for me to say to myself going into that conversation, it's more important for me to demonstrate care, that I care about Bob than it is for Bob to like me, and if I demonstrate that I care about Bob, then I'm going to do the right thing that will ultimately create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob. Me pulling my punches did not create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob.

Lenny (00:33:31):
I actually did that and I learned this from a manager of mine is just almost work backwards from ask them, what do you want to achieve in your career? Where do you want to go in this company and make sure they know you know what they want, and then basically work backwards from to get there. Here's the things you need to get, and here's the thing you did recently that isn't necessarily on the track and here's what we should be working on if you want to get to the skull that you have.

Kim Scott (00:33:57):
Yeah, I think one of the really important things that all managers can do for their direct reports to show that they care is to have real meaningful career conversations, where you talk about their life story, sort of their past, whatever part of it they're comfortable talking to you about so that you understand what motivates them at work. And I would have three separate 45 minute conversations, so one about their past, one about their future, their dreams for the future, and it's not just the next couple of years. It's like imagine at the height of your career you have everything you want. What does it look like? And give me three or four different pictures of that because very few of us know what we want to do when we grow up.

(00:34:40):
Then the third conversation is to sort of sit down with your director report and come up with a career action plan. So given what motivates you and where you want to go, what are the skills that it would be useful for you to develop so that you can get where you want to go and who can I introduce you to? What are the educational opportunities? Can we tweak your job so that you're gaining those skills so you're at least taking a step in the direction of your dreams, even if you're not there yet?

Lenny (00:35:11):
Awesome. I have a post about this. I'll link to in the show notes that gives people a guide to having these conversations, and there's a spreadsheet I share with people like, here's an action plan you can come up with your teammate and here's what you're going to work on these next six months.

Kim Scott (00:35:24):
Did you read the book When they Win, You Win by Russ Laraway?

Lenny (00:35:24):
No.

Kim Scott (00:35:29):
Oh, he has a hundred pages on career conversations and he's also built sort of some tools that help people. So check that out.

Lenny (00:35:39):
And it's called When You Win... When They Win, You Win.

Kim Scott (00:35:41):
When They Win, You Win.

Lenny (00:35:42):
Amazing.

Kim Scott (00:35:42):
Yes, by Russ Laraway, he and I worked together at Google and then we started a company together.

Lenny (00:35:48):
Oh wow. Okay, cool. We'll link to them in the show notes. Maybe I'll get him on the podcast too. Great.

Kim Scott (00:35:51):
Yeah, he'd be great.

Lenny (00:35:53):
Okay, so we've been chatting about ways individually to get better at some of these skills. Another area that I think people struggle with is the company culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback. So there's a question, so you probably saw this on Twitter. I asked people, what should I ask you? And a lot of people came in with a lot of questions and there's one that came in from Pete, so I'm just going to read it along these lines. So this question is just how do you practice being radically candid in a culture? And most cultures are like this where people aren't ready for direct feedback. Since company culture is often closer to ruinous empathy and being radically candid is more of a long-term good than a short-term good. You could potentially risk retention with your employees if you're too direct with them. So how do you think about finding this balance of being candid but not pissing people off, or do you just hire people that are open and ready for direct feedback and that's kind of how you solve that problem?

Kim Scott (00:36:45):
I don't think you can only hire people who are open and ready for direct feedback because it's hard for all of us. I just want to acknowledge that, it's hard for me. I mean, I wrote the book, I believe in it to my core and sometimes it's still hard for me. It's hard for me to hear it and it's hard for me to deliver it. This is a really difficult thing to do. The good thing about that two by two is it makes it look easy, which is useful, but it's not easy. So anyway, I think there are, to answer Pete's question, I think there are a few things that can help. There's really an order of operations to radical candor, and if you begin with soliciting criticism, then you take the first and most important step to improving your relationship with that person enough that it becomes easier for you to give it as well as to get it.

(00:37:35):
So I want to leave folks with some sort of steps on how to solicit feedback, and this is true, especially if you're a boss, but it's true in all your relationships. You can use this at home as well. So if you say, "Do you have any feedback for me?" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, "Oh no, everything's fine." Nobody in your life accepts your teenage children. If you have teenage children, they'd really want to give you some criticism, but nobody else in your life really wants to give you criticism. And so you want to think about how you're going to ask the person that's going to be most likely to elicit a response. The question that I like to ask is, "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?" But do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you.

(00:38:33):
I was working with Christa Quarles when she was CEO of OpenTable and she said, "Kim, I could never imagine those words coming out of my mouth." She said, "The way I like to ask is tell me why I'm wrong." Okay, that's fine too. It demands an answer to her question. But of course there were a couple of people on her team who felt that that was too aggressive, that shut them down, so she had to adjust her question. Being authentic does not mean ignoring the impact you're having on others. So you want to think about your question, you want to think about who you're going to ask that question of, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.

Lenny (00:39:22):
Let's spend more time on this actually. So what is it you recommend, that they pick? How many people would you recommend they pick, and ask feedback from?

Kim Scott (00:39:28):
Well, I think if you are a manager, you need to be soliciting every week feedback from each of your direct reports, and you need to sort of, I would budget five minutes at the end of your one-on-one to solicit feedback. So mostly a one-on-one should be your employees setting the agenda and your employee's time and don't by the way, save up when you have to give feedback. Don't save it up for your one-on-one and definitely don't save it up for a performance review. You want to give that in the moment. We can talk more about that in a second, but when you're soliciting feedback, save five minutes at the end of your one-on-one and ask that go-to question. And you also want to ask that go-to question of your cross-functional peers who you work most closely with and of your boss. And I think you don't want to ask the same question every single time. It'll start to sound like you don't really want the answer, but you want to make this part of your daily weekly routine with the people who you interact most closely with.

Lenny (00:40:34):
So you added to the end of this your one-on-one agenda, and two versions of this question are, what am I doing wrong? Which is that one I guess you iterated.

Kim Scott (00:40:43):
Tell me why I'm wrong or what am I doing wrong or what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me? Or what should I stop doing? What should I start doing? What should I continue doing? Those are some common ones. What do you like to ask Lenny?

Lenny (00:41:00):
I think it was something along the lines of like, what's one thing I could be doing better or what's one way I could be helping you be more successful?

Kim Scott (00:41:07):
That's a really good one. What's one way I could help you be more successful? Or Jason Rosoff, my co founder at Radical Candor likes to ask, "What could I have done this week?" So he time, he time bounds it. "What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?" In fact, Jason told me after we had worked together for about a month, he was like, "Kim, I really hate your go-to question." He said, "It's too open-ended for me. If you can tell me what you're working on and ask me at the end of a meeting specifically what I noticed then that is much better."

Lenny (00:41:48):
How often do you accept no answer? Just like, no everything's great.

Kim Scott (00:41:52):
Never,

Lenny (00:41:53):
Never,

Kim Scott (00:41:53):
Never. I mean, there are some people who really don't like to be put on the spot. So if I can tell that I'm inflicting a cruel and unusual punishment on the person, I'll say, "Look, you know I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something, notice something. It's the thing that you can do that would help me more than anything else that you could do is to tell me when I'm wrong because I need to know that." In fact, Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel said he used to at the end of his one-on-ones say to people, "There's one more thing. And he explained to me that that was coded Intel for like this is the most important thing." I was working at Apple at the time and I said, "Oh, did you get that from Steve Jobs?"

(00:42:47):
That was always how he introduced, "Just one more thing, the iPad." And Andy got immediately very grumpy and very offended, and he said, "No, we both got it from Colombo. The detective show." You can get tips from anywhere. So you want to make sure that you're though letting the person know that you really do care about what they say and that it's really when they give you this critical feedback that you're going to reward it. But that's not the end. Asking that question is only the first step, the bad news about your question, no matter how hard you think about it, and no matter how good a question it is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. There's no such thing as emotional Novocaine. That's why I don't believe in scripts. People believe if I just say the magic words like the door will open, that's not how it works. It's a give and take. So you want to sort of be prepared to embrace that discomfort. The only way out is through. Simplest way to embrace the discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six.

(00:43:59):
Only made it to three just there, and your eyes were popping out.

Lenny (00:44:03):
That is so long.

Kim Scott (00:44:04):
Six seconds is a really long time. Almost nobody can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something. So now you've dragged this poor soul out on a conversational limb that they never wanted to go on. They're probably going to say something. The third step is to make sure that you listen with the intent to understand not to respond, because you're probably going to feel defensive and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal or that you're shut down the feedback. All it means is that you're human. And that's all part of this. You want to figure out how to manage your natural defensive reaction to critical feedback, which you're probably going to have. The simplest tactic I can offer folks there is to think of some follow-up questions.

(00:44:56):
So at breakfast, my daughter not too long ago said to me, "Mom, I wish you weren't the Radical Candor lady." And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me and I thought, ah, I'm spending too much time at work. She wants more of my time. I shouldn't be traveling so much. But then I thought, well, I should ask her, make sure I understood. I'm jumping to conclusions here. I'm not listening with the intent to understand. So I asked a follow-up question. I said, "Well, who do you wish I were?" And she said, "I wish you were the lady who minded her own business," so I could go spend a little more time at work as far as she was concerned. So you want to make sure you really understand what a person is telling you. And once you feel certain that you really do understand and that you've been open to it, the last and most important step is to reward the candor.

(00:45:46):
A person takes a huge risk, especially if this person is your employee. A person takes a huge risk to give you critical feedback. And if you do not reward that risk richly, you're never going to get any feedback again. So if you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible, be loud. So-and-so told me that the tea in the break room is terrible, and now we have thirty-five different kinds of tea. Thank you for telling me. And that can demonstrate to people that they're not wasting their breath to come to you. That if you become aware of a problem, you'll fix it. And you also want to, by the way, you want to ask for feedback after you fixed it. Did I over-correct or did I under-correct?

(00:46:31):
My boss at Google, the same boss from the um story also told me when she gave me some feedback that I tended to move too fast. And she said, "Kim, until people and giving you feedback that you're going too slow. You won't have corrected this problem." So you kind of want to shoot to over-correct if you get some critical feedback. I also want to though pause on what to do when you get some critical feedback that you disagree with because it can be easy to feel wedged here. And if all you do is say thank you for the feedback, the other person is going to hear something much less polite than a brush off or worse.

(00:47:10):
And so what you want to do is you want to look for that five or 10% of whatever the person said that you can agree with, and you want to give voice to that. And then what you want to do is you want to say, "As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you." And then you've got to get back to them. You got to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree. And it's tempting to feel like a disagreement poses a risk to our relationships, but it's not disagreement that poses a risk to our relationships. It's unspoken disagreement. Many, I don't know about you Lenny, but a lot of my best professional relationships began with a good respectful disagreement.

Lenny (00:47:51):
Interesting. That reminds me of just watching Squid Games, the reality show on Netflix. Yeah. Have you seen this at all?

Kim Scott (00:47:56):
I haven't watched it, but it's on my list.

Lenny (00:47:59):
There's this guy who makes a huge bad decision on behalf of his whole team and they hate him in the show. And then on TikTok, he shared that they're best friends now, even though they called him a big idiot.

Kim Scott (00:48:09):
Yeah, no.

Lenny (00:48:09):
So funny.

Kim Scott (00:48:10):
It can happen for sure.

(00:49:32):
So to recap the steps roughly for how to get feedback from people, it's ask your question like what's one thing I could have done this week to make you more successful? Wait six seconds potentially or try to, it's very hard. Ask a few follow-up questions to make sure you understand what they're saying and then find a way to reward them. Say thank you.

Kim Scott (00:49:53):
Do more than say thank you.

Lenny (00:49:55):
Especially if you disagree, which is a really interesting nuance of this. I had Jules Walter on the podcast. I always think of him when I think of getting feedback. He shared this advice. When you get feedback, just be so appreciative so that people keep giving me just like, "Thank you so much for that feedback." The way he phrases it. Even if you're melting inside and really hate this feedback, just like, "thank you, I really appreciate it." But I think your nuance there is really key is if you do disagree, I really like this tip of just like, let me think about this element of it and then actually follow up.

Kim Scott (00:50:25):
Even if you're melting inside, if you say thank you and you're melting inside, I mean maybe it's a terrible actor, but usually people know. And that's why I say it's not enough to say thank you. You got to fix the problem and then show what you did to fix the problem and get more feedback. Did I over-correct? Did I under-correct. And if you disagree, you got to say that you disagree, but you got to say, so respectfully.

Lenny (00:50:48):
As a leader, this sounds like a lot of work to be doing every week. If you have a one-on-one following up correcting things. Is there anything you'd recommend there? Or is it just, this is really important, you got to make time.

Kim Scott (00:50:58):
It's not as much work as failing to do this as we saw from the Bob story. So I think that the important thing that I have found is that this is part of why it's so important to do it immediately. It's important for the other person, but it's also important for you. If you're doing this in a one-on-one, which you should be having anyway. So you're saving some time in a one-on-one. So it's not adding time necessarily to your day. And when you hear about problems, you should fix them. Yes, it takes time, but that is your job. And when you disagree with something, you can disagree in your next regularly scheduled one-on-one. So I'm not talking about adding meetings to your calendar, so it doesn't actually take more time. I have found that in fact, it saves tremendous amounts of time, but it does take emotional discipline.

(00:51:52):
And I think it also requires you, especially when it comes to giving it, which we talked about before, where the humble, helpful, those are impromptu two-minute conversations, giving the feedback that you should be having in between your meetings. In the um story, walk to my meeting with me, it didn't take any extra time for my boss to give me that feedback. She had to walk to her meeting anyway, and I had to go in the same direction. So it didn't even take extra time from me. But it is, I think one of the most common reasons why people don't do this in addition to fear of retaliation and just sort of existential dread, which are both factors, which hopefully we've helped alleviate, but is that you're scheduled back to back to back and you don't have those two minutes in between meetings.

(00:52:42):
And that's why I think it's important either to schedule slack time in your calendar, make your 30 minute meetings, 25 minute meetings, make your hour-long meetings, 50 minute meetings, maybe give yourself a few breaks in the day. But if it's not possible, and often it was not possible for me in my career to sort of schedule my time that way, I just decided that these moments of management were more important than being on time to my next meeting. And so I was just late sometimes. So I wish I had a better answer than either control your time, which is really annoying advice because it's impossible to follow or be willing to be late to your next meeting. But those were the things that I tried to do.

Lenny (00:53:34):
That was super helpful. I think your point of just, if you're not making two minutes to do this thing now, it'll be a lot more time intensive later.

Kim Scott (00:53:40):
Oh yeah. It's stitch in time takes nine on all these two minute, and really it should be brushing and flossing. This is not like a root canal. These are like, this is relationship hygiene that you should be doing all the time.

Lenny (00:53:55):
I was just reading Charlie Munger's book and there's a quote that he references of just the classic, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

Kim Scott (00:54:03):
Yes, absolutely.

Lenny (00:54:04):
Same idea. So we've talked about a leader getting feedback. What if you're the employee? Do you also recommend the same thing in the one-on-one, have an agenda item and ask this question? Or is there a different approach you'd recommend?

Kim Scott (00:54:16):
I think yes, if you're the employee, you should also be soliciting feedback on a regular basis from your boss. So there's sort of an order of operations you want to solicit at first, no matter who you are, it's the same up, down, and sideways, even though it feels very different, the order of operations is the same. So start by soliciting feedback. Then you want to give both praise and criticism. I think sometimes it feels like you're kissing up if you give your boss praise, but bosses need praise too. And if there are things that your boss does that you appreciate and you want your boss to do more of those things, praise is a better tool for that than criticism. When it comes time to offering your boss some critical feedback, you want to make sure, and by the way, this is also true when it comes time to give your employee critical feedback or your spouse or anybody else in your life, you want to be sure that you are prepared to gauge how it lands.

(00:55:09):
So you want to start in kind of a neutral place. You don't want to go to the outer edge of challenge directly because then you're going to wind up in obnoxious aggression. So if we go back to that story, my boss started, "You said um a lot, were you aware of it?" "Nah." That was my response. And then "I know this great speech coach, would you like an introduction?" "Nah," was my response. So she had to keep going out on that challenge directly. She didn't start out by saying, "When you say um I'm every third word, it makes you sound stupid." But she realized she had to go that far. So you want to keep going out if you think they're brushing you off. But if you find that your boss looks either sad or mad, that is your cue to move up on the care personally dimension.

(00:55:51):
And so to take a moment, and if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, "I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?" And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly. I don't know about you Lenny, but if I say something to someone and they look sad, it's so tempting for me to try to pull the words back. "Oh no, it's no big deal. I didn't mean it," but it is a big deal, and I did mean it, that's why I just said it. And so if you go the wrong way on challenge directly, you wind up in ruinous empathy, and then you leave the person both sad and confused, so you make it worse.

(00:56:34):
So you want to take a beat to pay attention to the emotions in the moment, but not to go the wrong way on challenge directly. Same thing if they're mad, although if somebody's mad, that maybe is even harder. If somebody starts yelling at me, it's tempting for me either to start yelling back and wind up in obnoxious aggression or to crawl off to a self-protective, manipulative insincerity. And so instead, what I try to do is get curious, not furious, and why is this person so mad? So say like, Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it.

Lenny (00:57:14):
This comes back to the point you made about when you're giving feedback to try to do it in person or on a phone call to do exactly what you're saying, to read them as you're giving this feedback and figure out which axis you want to go down.

Kim Scott (00:57:25):
Yeah, you want to gauge it. I mean, when we communicate with other people, we communicate on an emotional level and on an intellectual level at the same time. And if we ignore the emotional signals that are coming at us or say don't take it personally, then we're just not going to communicate very well.

Lenny (00:57:43):
Along these same lines, another question that came in is from a coach of yours that works I think for you or somehow with the program. She asked this question of many top leaders have very low self-awareness. They believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to give feedback, or they just ignore the problem and fire people with no feedback. Is there something you've learned about how to change their mind about this is the way to operate?

Kim Scott (00:58:05):
Yeah, I think the most important thing with leaders like that, that you can do is to explain to them the impact that they're having and to also show them that there is another way that is going to help them succeed. Very often the leaders who are low on the care personally dimension, they do care about their results and they do care about their own careers. And so when you sort of explain this to them in terms of enlightened self-interest, they tend to get better at it. And also, I mean there I can think of maybe one or two people I've worked with who are truly low on care, who truly don't care. Very often people are bad at showing they care, but they do actually care. And also sometimes there are leaders who think they're not supposed to care. And so unleashing that capacity that they innately have to care and telling them this is actually part of the job can make them a much better, more effective leader. But look, if someone is a psychopath and they truly don't care, they shouldn't be a manager. That's the solution.

Lenny (00:59:27):
I totally get that one. So I really like that takeaway. Just basically show them the impact they're having because to your point, they want the company to succeed. They want their team to succeed. And if they're not realizing there's downsides to the way they're operating.

Kim Scott (00:59:38):
And they want themselves to succeed. That's why I say part of the problem with obnoxious aggression is that you harm other people, but it's also inefficient because when you act like that, people can't hear what you're saying, so you're wasting your breath.

Lenny (00:59:56):
And the way you show them that impact. Do you recommend interviewing people, getting stories, seeing, I don't know, how do you collect this impact so that they're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this.

Kim Scott (01:00:07):
I think that the best thing to do is, for me anyway, is I start by sharing stories from my career and stories when I was a jerk. I've acted like a jerk too, plenty of times, unfortunately. And I show the impact that I've had and then I ask them for a similar story. And usually sort of me holding up the mirror to myself is useful for them to be able to hold the mirror up to themselves to realize you want to help these people adopt a growth mindset around this stuff. I am not telling you that you're an asshole. I'm telling you that we all behave like assholes sometimes. And it's a big problem for us as well as for the people around us. And here's my story, when I acted like a jerk, what's yours? And people, that kind of self-awareness, sometimes people talk about inflicted insight like it's some kind of burden, but usually that kind of self-awareness makes people feel lighter. They're like, "Ah, now I know what's wrong and now I know what I can do about it."

Lenny (01:01:14):
Yeah, I've definitely noticed that about your stories. They always are you making the mistake, which I think is very disarming.

Kim Scott (01:01:20):
We all make mistakes.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Yeah. Maybe the extreme of this obnoxious aggressiveness is Bridgewater. Their whole approach is like theirs.

Kim Scott (01:01:31):
Oh my gosh. Did you read the book The Fund?

Lenny (01:01:34):
No, not yet.

Kim Scott (01:01:35):
You must read it. It's all about Bridgewater. I always thought it was problematic. I had no idea just how problematic it is. Put that book in the show notes one of the best business books I've read in the last decade.

Lenny (01:01:48):
Wow, that is high praise. Yes, I will read that. And so I guess for people that aren't familiar, like Bridgewater, they encourage, they have a system called Dots where they tell people, you must give hard critical feedback after every meeting, publicly.

Kim Scott (01:02:01):
Not after the meeting, in the meeting, publicly. And it's recorded on, it was, I think they changed it since, but it was recorded for posterity on video. And sometimes, in fact, true story, shortly after I left Google, I was approached to work at Bridgewater in a management capacity, not in an investment capacity. And so I called someone I knew who worked there and he said, "Let me give you an anecdote." He said, "The other day there was a meeting and there was a woman who in the meeting who had made a mistake and everybody just piled on. The criticism was very personal. There was no core about the criticism. It was like, these are your personality attributes that make you a useless human being. Kind of terrible feedback until she started to cry and the whole meeting was recorded and then they emailed a recording of the meeting out to the whole company, including all the people who were not in the meeting saying, this is an example of how to have..." So I would say that is deep, dark, obnoxious aggression. That is not radical candor. That is horrible.

Lenny (01:03:24):
So it's safe to say you're not a fan of that approach?

Kim Scott (01:03:26):
No. In fact, I did an analysis of Dalio's book Principles and it's like a, I don't know, 3 or 400 page book. And there were I think four or five pages about caring about people. There's very low care personally.

Lenny (01:03:44):
I imagine many people see that, they see Elon, they see Steve Jobs, and the perception is they're very challenge directly people, they're not clearly care about you people, but they're very successful. What do you say to people that are like, but it works. Why wouldn't I be that if that's the way I want to do it?

Kim Scott (01:04:00):
Well, first of all, I would not put Steve Jobs in the same category as Ray Dalio and Elon Musk. I mean, Steve Jobs could be obnoxiously aggressive, but mostly I would say he built such good relationships with his direct reports that when he got cancer, Tim Cook offered to give him half his liver. And I don't know of a word to describe that other than love. These were real human relationships. When I worked at Apple, you could see Steve and Johnny talking. You could tell these people cared about each other. Now, radical candor gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And I think that Steve had built a team around him of people who didn't mind rather what other people would consider obnoxious aggression. But I think in the context of their relationship, it was understood as care.

(01:05:03):
I'll give you an example of that from my own career, not that I am comparing myself to Steve Jobs, I think I'm a much gentler person, but sometimes I develop relationships with people. And part of that relationship is that we push each other pretty hard. So there was a person who I had worked with for a long time, for many years. He had followed me from one company to another, and we were localizing a product and he kept conflating Slovakia and Slovenia, and I corrected him once. I corrected him twice the third time, I was like, did Slovakia, not Slovenia dumb ass.

(01:05:44):
And he started laughing, and that was fine in the context of our relationship, but I realized that the people around me, I was silencing them. They were like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to make a mistake. Kim's going to call me a dumb ass." So I had to pause and say, "Look, I respect this person enormously, and I like this person enormously. We work very well together." And so I think that sometimes people have relationships with others and they have those relationships in public and other people misinterpret those relationships.

(01:06:19):
Steve Jobs was not perfect. He made all kinds of mistakes, but he was no Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who I would say make far more and worse and more egregious mistakes. And I think you're raising a really important point. You're raising a point, which is that there's this false dichotomy. In fact, the new biography of Elon Musk falls into this category. I like Walter Isaacson's work a lot, but he falls prey to this in his biography of Elon Musk, which is there's this notion that we have to choose between being a total jerk but really competent or really nice but incompetent. And those are not our two choices. That's the whole point of radical candor is that there's this other way that works better and doesn't hurt people.

Lenny (01:07:13):
I think that's the key takeaway there is you can be even more successful if you lean into the care deeply. In theory, they could have gotten more out of their people if they made it clear they really care about them.

Kim Scott (01:07:26):
And there's plenty of counter examples of incredibly successful people who are very caring leaders, and it's not as much fun to tell stories about that. And so we don't as often.

Lenny (01:07:40):
Along the same lines, there's someone that you worked with that suggested I ask you about investing in your authentic leadership style, Melissa Tan. I don't know if you remember her.

Kim Scott (01:07:50):
Yes.

Lenny (01:07:51):
Okay, great. And she was on the podcast in the past, and she just said how when she met you, she was a very people-pleasery person and just wanted to be like, and you helped her develop her natural leadership style. Can you just talk about what you suggest to people to figure this out and how to find that for yourself?

Kim Scott (01:08:06):
I mean, I wonder what Melissa would say, but my memory of conversations with her, and this is an issue that I talk about a lot because a people pleaser too. I grew up in the South and I'm a woman. I was not brought up to challenge directly. That was not part of the culture that I was brought up in. I was brought up to be polite but also brought up to be kind. And for me, the thing that is most important to hang on to is that fundamental kindness and to realize that it's actually unkind not to say the thing. And so that is part of the reason why I encourage people. I tell the Bob story so often and I encourage other leaders who I work with to think about what their Bob story is that you realize it's not nice in the long run.

(01:09:00):
It's unkind in the long run, not to tell someone if they're making a mistake. There's nothing nice about that in the long run. And so that I think at least for me, that's been helpful. And then another thing that is helpful is again, to get others focused, to focus not on pleasing people, but on doing the right thing for those people, on truly caring about those people more than you care about your own discomfort in the moment. And that is something that is easier for people to do than just to challenge directly. I think in many ways it's about what is getting in the way. That's why I call it ruinism. Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes empathy can paralyze at least me because I'm so acutely aware of how what I'm going to say might impact the other person, might hurt their feelings that I don't say it.

(01:10:01):
And so when I push myself to be, and you can call it compassionate candor if you like that better than radical candor. But when I push myself not to feel so acutely what I think the other person might feel, and by the way, I could be wrong about what I think the other person might often, they're like, it's no big deal. They're like, oh, thank you for letting me know. But when I can let go of that and think about the other person and what I care about and what they care about for their future, going back to your point, if you know that it's really important for someone to get promoted and they won't get promoted if they keep talking to people in a particular way, then you're focused on what they want. That is really helpful to move past that.

Lenny (01:10:47):
Just a few more questions before we wrap up. Your book sold something like half a million copies.

Kim Scott (01:10:47):
A million now.

Lenny (01:11:00):
A million copies.

Kim Scott (01:11:00):
Million copies. Million in 23 languages. Yes.

Lenny (01:11:00):
23 languages. I had a stat of 20 languages. Jesus Christ. So a lot of people have read it, a lot of people have been using it. What's something that people often just get wrong that super frustrates you about the system, the recommendations that you just wish people come on, here's what I really wanted to say, or here's what you should change.

Kim Scott (01:11:17):
There's two things. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, when you write about a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it. One is this, in the spirit of Radical Candor and then the person acts like a jerk. That is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That is the spirit of obnoxious aggression. But shortly after the book came out, I was giving a talk at a tech company in San Francisco and I got some feedback from the CEO of that company that was so impactful that it caused me to write my next book, which is called Radical Respect. And in many ways, Radical Respect is kind of the prequel to Radical Candor because if you don't respect the other person, it's impossible to care about them and you're not going to bother challenging them directly. So what happened in this meeting? I walked in, I was really excited to give this talk.

(01:12:04):
The CEO had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade. She's a person I like and respect enormously, and she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech or in any other sector. And when I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, "Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's really going to help me build the kind of career I want." But she said, "I got to tell you, it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you." And she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would offer folks even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true as soon as she said it, and I knew how unfair it was because she's like one of the most even keeled, cheerful people I've ever worked with.

(01:12:49):
And I realized a bunch of things at the same time when she told me that, the first was that I had not been the kind of colleague that I aspire to be, that I imagined myself to be. I had failed even to notice the extent to which she had to show up unfailingly, cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together even though she had what to be ticked off about as we all do at work. So I had failed to be an upstander, a good colleague. The second thing I realized was that I had also failed to acknowledge when I was experiencing different versions of bias, prejudice and bullying. And I think part of the reason it's kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit she was in denial. But I had been in denial about a bunch of experiences I had had in the workplace.

(01:13:41):
I had pretended that a whole host of things were not happening, that were in fact happening. And I think part of the reason why I did that was that I never wanted to think of myself as a victim, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim did I want to think of myself as the culprit. So I'd been even more deeply in denial about the times that I had said or done things that hurt other people who I worked with, said or done things that were biased or worse. I had bullied people before. And by the way, when you become a leader, you're much more prone to bullying even if you don't think of yourself as a bully, which I certainly don't think of myself as a bully, but that doesn't mean I never bullied anyone. And then the last thing I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating these BS free zones, but I had allowed all manner of BS to pass. So that was what prompted me to write the next book, Radical Respect, which you can pre-order right now and please do.

Lenny (01:14:41):
That was my next question. Talk more about this book. What is it about? Where people find it?

Kim Scott (01:14:46):
Radical Respect comes out in May. You can pre-order it now. Anywhere you buy books, at your local independent bookstore, I'm speaking at a conference of independent bookstore owners soon you can pre-order it on Amazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere else you buy buy books.

Lenny (01:15:05):
And who would you say it's most for?

Kim Scott (01:15:08):
So there are chapters in that book about things leaders can do. There are chapters in the book about things you can do if you're harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying. There are chapters in the book about how to be a great upstander, how to be a better colleague, and there are chapters in the book about how to become part of the solution, not part of the problem when you're the culprit. And I think we all find ourselves in all four of those roles at different moments in time, and I don't think there's any one group who can solve this problem. Everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment.

Lenny (01:15:48):
Awesome. We'll link to that in the show notes.

Kim Scott (01:15:50):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:15:51):
To leave people with a very tactical next step. What's one thing they could do this week today to get better at Radical Candor, to start building that muscle?

Kim Scott (01:16:00):
I would love it if everyone would write down their go-to question what are the words that will come out of your mouth and practice it. Practice it in front of the mirror and then practice it with a friend and refine it. Just figure out what, because it is uncomfortable to solicit feedback from others. They don't want to give it to you and you don't really want to hear it. So if everybody can write down their go-to question and then put five minutes in your calendar of someone you're going to ask that question of.

Lenny (01:16:31):
And that calendar entry, I was going to come back to it actually. So you do the one-on-one agenda, adding the question, the calendar entry is for people you don't have a one-on-one with, pick someone that you're going to ask that you're not meeting with regularly.

Kim Scott (01:16:42):
Absolutely. Or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda. That's fair too. Either one.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Amazing. Kim, is there anything else you want to leave folks with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Kim Scott (01:16:52):
I think just remember, you do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person.

Lenny (01:17:00):
Oh, I love that. Amazing. Okay, well with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Kim Scott (01:17:07):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:17:08):
What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? You've already mentioned a few but what do you want to share?

Kim Scott (01:17:14):
Yes, I've mentioned a couple. Please do buy Radical Respect, I believe that the more novels people read, the better. People often ask me, what can I do to move up on the care personally dimension of Radical Candor and read more novels? This is the best way I know of to build compassion for other people, to understand the emotional signals that might be coming at you. I mean, some of my favorite novels are Middlemarch. I try to reread that all the time. Anything that Toni Morrison wrote, the Bluest Eye is one of my favorite, but also Song of Solomon. It just such a brilliant writer and will help you enter into the lives of people that you haven't entered into. I think that Orlando by Virginia Woolf is another one of my favorites. And Robertson Davies, the Deptford Trilogy is an incredible set of novels to read. I'm cheating now and giving you three.

Lenny (01:18:27):
The more the merrier.

Kim Scott (01:18:27):
Yes, Alice Walker, the Color Purple is another one of my very favorite books, so I recommend reading more novels.

Lenny (01:18:34):
I love this leaning into fiction that doesn't come up often on this podcast, so this is great. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Kim Scott (01:18:47):
I watched all 19 seasons of Grey's Anatomy with my daughter during and after COVID. That was really fun.

Lenny (01:18:55):
Actually. I did the same thing with my wife. We didn't do all the seasons, but we watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy.

Kim Scott (01:18:59):
We watched every single one. It's still coming out.

Lenny (01:19:04):
Yeah, it's funny to see which characters continue and which I die off, leave.

Kim Scott (01:19:07):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny (01:19:09):
Oh man. Okay. Funny

Kim Scott (01:19:10):
And Shonda Rhimes, I mean, watch her TED Talk, amazing person.

Lenny (01:19:14):
All right, we'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people that might be helpful to folks interviewing?

Kim Scott (01:19:22):
The question that I like to ask is just tell me the story of your career. And I know that's kind of, maybe it's a hard, it seems like a softball, but it's actually can be unfairly hard or not. I don't know, unfairly hard, but I always learn a lot about people from how they tell the story of their life and their career. And then what I try to do is they'll say a couple of things that really interest me and I sort of double-click down into the details of a couple of aspects. I love people's life stories, so that makes it a more fun conversation for me. Often people like talking about themselves so it's not too painful for them, but you also learn all kinds of unexpected things.

Lenny (01:20:13):
And is there anything you're looking for in an answer that's like, this is a good person to hire or is it mostly information? I'm just gathering a lot of background.

Kim Scott (01:20:22):
I find that I learn how the person approaches setbacks from a story, from the way they tell a story. I learn whether a person is able to identify mistakes they made. I mean, if you say, "Tell me the story of your career," if there's not a couple of mistakes in there, I also find that when they talk about accomplishments and then I double click on it, I learn a lot about what a person really did. Sometimes a person will claim credit for something that just happened that they had very little to actually to do with, and I learn about very often. I find that a good way to learn about people's skills and depth of knowledge.

Lenny (01:21:10):
Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?

Kim Scott (01:21:14):
Yes. I love my new it's called Attitude, and they're shampoo bars and conditioner bars, so it comes in cardboard, wrapped in paper. There's no plastic. It's much more environmentally friendly, and I have long hair. It gets very tingly and the conditioner works, so I recommend.

Lenny (01:21:35):
Very unique suggestion. Is there a favorite motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, find useful to come back to in work or in life?

Kim Scott (01:21:46):
"It's not mean. It's clear." This is something someone told me on the streets of Manhattan. It's actually the origin story of Radical Candor. I was walking my dog, almost got hit by a cab, and this man, a perfect stranger, looked at me and he said, "I can tell you love that dog." That was all he had to do to move up on the care personally dimension, but he says, "You're going to kill that dog if you don't teach her to sit." And he pointed at the ground this kind of harsh gesture. He said, "Sit." The dog sat, had no idea she even knew what that meant. And I kind of looked up at him in amazement and he said, "It's not mean. It's clear." And then the light changed and he walked off leaving me with words to live by. So I think about that stranger all the time.

Lenny (01:22:30):
Such a good story. Final question. I read online that you started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow at some point in your life. Can you please explain this part of your life?

Kim Scott (01:22:41):
Yes. So I studied Russian literature in college, very practical major. And then I moved to what was then the Soviet Union in 1990 when I graduated from college, and I wound up taking a job with, first of all, I was with an investment company and then they pulled out of Russia and put the money in China. And so I wanted to stay in Russia and through a friend of a friend, I got a job working for this diamond company called Lazare Kaplan, new York-based diamond company, and they were trying to figure out what they should do in Russia. And I found out there was an opportunity to start this diamond cutting factory. And it was actually my first management job because I had to hire these diamond cutters and I had to hire them away from these Russian diamond cutting factories and I knew nothing about management or business or anything.

(01:23:44):
I'd studied Russian literature. I knew a lot about Dostoyevsky, so I thought it was going to be easy though. I was like, well, the ruble is collapsing. I'm going to pay them in dollars. Of course they'll come work for me. But they didn't take the job right away. To my surprise, they wanted to have a picnic. And at the picnic we brought a bottle of vodka, and there's a rule in Russia, if you open a bottle, you got to finish the bottle.

(01:24:07):
So by the end of the bottle of vodka, I realized that what I could offer that the state could not offer them was to give a damn about them. They wanted to know that I would be a manager who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways there. And as you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about, they were all men, about these men because I haven't been able to get them out. And I'm devastated by what Russia has done to Ukraine, but that was the moment when I realized that management really matters, and that to be good at it, you have to care about other people. And that was what made it interesting to me.

Lenny (01:24:53):
Man, that is a heavy first job as a manager.

Kim Scott (01:24:56):
Yeah. Yes, it was.

Lenny (01:24:58):
Wow, Kim, this was awesome. I think we're going to help a lot of people become better leaders. I think we're going to help a lot of companies change their culture. I'm so honored that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up and learn more about your stuff? And then two, how can listeners be helpful to you?

Kim Scott (01:25:18):
Radicalcandor.com is our website, and I'm not much on Twitter slash X anymore, but you can find us. We do a lot of posting on LinkedIn. I think that the thing that people can help me do is to send us a note. You can also email us radicalcandor@radicalcandor.com and let us know what could we do in podcasts like this or in our materials? What could we do that would make it easier for you to put these ideas into practice? Because Radical Candor is, it's about behavior change, and it sounds easy, but it's really hard, and we're always trying to figure out how to help people walk the talk here.

Lenny (01:26:02):
I think doing this podcast is going to make a dent in that goal.

Kim Scott (01:26:05):
Oh, good.

Lenny (01:26:06):
Kim, thank you so much for being here.

Kim Scott (01:26:08):
Thank you. I really enjoyed it.

Lenny (01:26:11):
Same. Bye everyone.

# Using behavioral science to improve your product | Kristen Berman (Irrational Labs)

## Transcript

Kristen Berman (00:00):
Economics says, "Look, people are rational. We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons." I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, "Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms." But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.

Lenny (00:45):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Kristen Berman. Kristen is the CEO and co-founder of Irrational Labs where she and her team use behavioral science to help companies like Google, Airbnb, PayPal, Microsoft, Fidelity, and TikTok build better and more successful products.

Lenny (01:15):
In our conversation, we cover a ton of real-life examples of product changes that have her and her team helped craft that led to significant impact at the companies. We talk about what biases and psychologies they find most commonly get in the way of people achieving what they want achieve in your product, her biggest surprises and insights about human psychology and how it relates to product design, a couple of real-life case studies including our work with TikTok and the change they made in the product as a result, and so much more. I found this conversation super fascinating and super tactical, and I can't wait for you to hear it. And so with that, I bring you Kristen Berman.

Lenny (01:55):
Hey, Ashley, head of marketing in Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?

Ashley (02:02):
At least 40%.

Lenny (02:04):
And how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?

Ashley (02:07):
Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.

Lenny (02:26):
I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.

Ashley (02:41):
Totally. It's credible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:50] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.

Lenny (03:54):
Kristen, welcome to the podcast.

Kristen Berman (03:57):
Thanks, Lenny. Great to be here.

Lenny (03:58):
It's great to have you. You're on something called Irrational Labs, and so, to set a little context for folks, can you just talk about what it is you all do at Irrational Labs?

Kristen Berman (04:08):
Yeah, so Irrational Labs, we are a behavioral science consulting and design shop. So, we think about all things behavior change. We work on understanding psychologies that drive users, and then designing and testing ways to change behavior and drive engagement.

Kristen Berman (04:28):
I started it in 2013 with Dan Ariely, who's a famed behavioral economist. We started just working with a handful of companies, and now we have a team of 20 behavioral scientists working on behavior change across industries.

Lenny (04:43):
Can you talk about some of the companies that you've worked with, just to give us some examples? And then, what kind of stuff have you actually helped them with?

Kristen Berman (04:50):
We started a lot of our work at Google. We were actually embedded within Google for around three years. I even had a bus pass. And we started their behavioral economics team. We worked with over 25 teams from like self-driving cars to YouTube. And so, that was a big piece of the early work. And then recently, we've done work with TikTok where we've tried to... It actually accomplished decreasing misinformation share by 24%. We worked with one medical on how to increase setting doctor's appointments right away during the onboarding, and that worked and drove it up by 20%. We worked with Credit Karma on basically helping them increase set up for reoccurring deposits. We did that and increased it by 18%. So, basically a variety of ways to drive behavior change. Done stuff with Intuit, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and obviously, a variety of startups as well.

Lenny (05:45):
Wow. Okay, we're definitely going to talk about some of those examples. I'm super curious to hear what you did with TikTok, big company and story these days. Before we get to that, what exactly is behavioral design, and can you just define this space for us?

Kristen Berman (06:00):
Let's start with what is behavioral economics? So, basically, behavioral economics is a reaction to economics. So, economics says, "Look, people are rational. We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons." I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, "Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms." But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.

Lenny (06:51):
What are some of the biggest surprises, or maybe unintuitive results that you've come across working with companies using these insights in behavioral design, behavioral economics?

Kristen Berman (07:02):
Yeah, great question. One story that recently happened is actually a surprise that happened to the client. The partner was shocked. It actually didn't surprise us. And so, this was with a popular FinTech app and their most requested feature was budgeting. So, it came through all the support forums, interviews, felt like a table stakes feature; people wanted budgeting. And so, if you're the PM there, you're probably like, "You may talk to a few other users. You may get some confirmation, but you're likely building budgeting." And that's really where they were when we came and started working with them. We couldn't move them in another direction, but we did convince them to do an experiment. So, we convinced them to test, and there was three conditions. One was the control, which is just telling people how much they spend, and the other two were variations on budgeting. So, two different ways to do budgeting.

Kristen Berman (07:57):
So, big experiment. This is with 10,000 people, so we can really trust the results. And what happened? Nothing. So, they were shocked. The team was shocked. Remember, this is a big investment of time and effort, took a lot of energy to build. Zero change in average spend, zero change in spend variability. And so, the question is: Why weren't we surprised? Why were they surprised? The thinking here is if you map out every single step that it takes to do this behavior, and the behavior would be reducing your spend, it's pretty clear that budgeting just isn't going to pull the weight. And this is what we call a behavioral diagnosis, where you map out every single step. So, you'd have to know what your budget is. You'd have to know where in the month you are. You'd have to make a plan to do it. You then have to do it multiple times during the month. Incredibly difficult to do this one behavior. And once you do that behavioral diagnosis and you map out... We try to understand what people actually do versus what they say they will do. And by doing that, it becomes wildly clear that we should all be skeptical that budgeting would actually work to change the behavior that you're trying to get to.

Lenny (09:03):
Yeah, I'm also not surprised that didn't have a big impact. I have so many apps with budgeting features and I've tried many times to use them and it never sticks. It's like, "Eh, I'm just going to..." It's too much work.

Kristen Berman (09:15):
It's way too much work. And so, sometimes, any kind of work that we put on the user, we should be skeptical. We have to really prove that it's worth their time, and then measure if they actually do it.

Lenny (09:26):
Is there a better approach to that specific problem that you've found, or is that too broad of a question?

Kristen Berman (09:33):
The first line of defense in any problem solving would be, how would you make it easier for somebody to do? And so, in the personal finance world, really, the answer to most things is just default. So, it worked for automatic enrollment 401(k). The reason we have retirement savings in America is because people are defaulted into saving from their paycheck. So, that would be first line of defense. Obviously, difficult for product teams to execute on, takes a lot of backend infrastructure. So, if we were just solving the personal financial management stuff of like a budgeting alternative, we'd actually go to making it not just logistically easier, but cognitively easier. So, we call them rules of thumb; instead of having to decide in the moment, do I do this thing? And you're weighing the pros and cons. It's kind of typical econ, like, how much is this $3 worth to me? You'd actually make a rule of thumb that says, "Do I do it, or not?" So, instead of deciding, do you take a Lyft when you're coming home from work, you'd have a rule of thumb that says, "I don't take Lyft on the weekdays. I take it on the weekends." Very simple now to actually make this kind of decision. It's a heuristic . It's not going to be perfect, but it's going to help you reduce your spend in an easier way, at least, in a way that you'd stayed adherent to.

Lenny (10:46):
It reminds me a bit of James Clears' idea of creating this identity for yourself where he is like, "If you're like, 'I am a person that doesn't take Lyft on the weekdays', that becomes kind of this identity component and that makes it easier for you not to do that." Is that related?

Kristen Berman (11:00):
Yeah, basically. Sometimes, we think behavior change is driven by our attitudes, our preferences like, "I really want to be a runner" or "I really like this thing." But in reality, our behavior is driven by what we do. So, in order to change behavior, you have to do something different. It's not enough to have a goal objective to do it. And I think, maybe that's the big annoying thing about the self-help industry. It kind of just tells you it's enough to have a goal. It's not enough. You actually need to redesign your environment to change your behavior.

Lenny (11:35):
Is there any other examples of big surprises or unintuitive results from work you've done?

Kristen Berman (11:40):
One big one is actually... And I'm sure people listening have worked on signup flows before. This is kind of a common question and challenge in product world. And the common thinking is, and most often correct, that if you reduce friction to the signup flow, your conversion will increase. This is kind of the law that we all live by. And yet, there is one example, one time, where this is just not true, that you can actually increase friction and increase conversion. So, actually Lenny, have I ever told you about my mother?

Lenny (12:12):
Nope.

Kristen Berman (12:13):
Okay. So, now you're thinking about my mother.

Lenny (12:16):
Oh.

Kristen Berman (12:16):
Before, you were not thinking about... There's nothing about my mother, but I just made you think about my mother by asking you a question.

Lenny (12:22):
Son of a gun.

Kristen Berman (12:23):
So, when you ask a question, you can insert an idea into someone's head, you can get them thinking about something different. And so, in a sign up flow, what would you want people to be thinking about? You probably want them to be thinking about the benefits that you offer. So, if you ask them a question they can think about the benefits, it's going to increase their motivation to get over the hump of the future friction you're going to put in front of them because now they understand the benefits. So, as an example, if you go to Apartment List, they ask you questions during the signup flow that's like: What kind of apartment do you want? Do you want a studio, or a one-bedroom, a five bedroom? Do you want a patio, a basement, a view? Now, all of a sudden, I'm thinking, I'm engaging with the benefit. I understand how much supply that they have. So, if you Stitch Fix, or... Actually, Trunk Club has come out and said they did this and it increased conversion by 133%.

Kristen Berman (13:16):
So, asking these questions can really drive conversion. We actually did something where we put a quiz on a partner's website. It's TytoCare which is basically a device that lets you remotely connect to a physician. It's a little bit hard to use, but we wanted to help people understand the device, and we asked them questions about their medical behavior, their frequency use of technology. And for people who completed a quiz, 53% of them went on to purchase versus 37% who didn't complete. So, these type of questions can have a real impact.

Lenny (13:51):
And so, very tactically, the idea here is you add a step to your flow that asks the user some question that isn't actually something you need an answer to, but may get them to be more excited by finishing. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (14:04):
Exactly, yeah. And I would say probably most teams can do this. You can replace the carousel. The carousel is something where it tells you the benefit, but we want people to actively engage with the benefit so that they're thinking about how you can improve and affect their lives.

Lenny (14:22):
So, you said it's worked a couple times. It probably isn't something that usually works. Is there experience like sometimes it may work, maybe worth trying, but usually probably won't work. Is that generally right?

Kristen Berman (14:32):
We want to remove the field that was like an open text fields where we're asking people an open-ended question and we improved conversion by 40% page over page. So, for sure, some questions are harder and you should not ask them. When questions are easier and it's a drop down multiple choice, this is when you should be trying it. But definitely, the recommendation is not to ask a hard question where people have to think about it.

Kristen Berman (14:58):
By the way, for the question that we did, that was open text, the folks on the team thought that it was an easy question. But most questions when you're asking people with an open text field, it's just not an easy question.

Lenny (15:10):
Right. I hate those open text fields. And then, just one last, because I imagine people listening to this are like, "Oh, maybe I should run this experiment." Is the general best practice to ask a question that gets you to think about something that motivates you by finishing? What's like the rough mental model there?

Kristen Berman (15:26):
I think each product, obviously, will be different. One example would be, if I'm a bill pay app, you could tell me that I could pay my bill once a week, every day, every month, I could time it, but a better approach would be to ask me, "Do you want us to pay your bills immediately, or every week, or every month?" And so, what you're doing there is engaging people in the setup and actually implicitly telling them, "We can pay your bills immediately." So, would think about combining those two is showing people the benefit, like, how fast you want us to pay your bills, which gets you to think about how fast they are, and the settings which is actually you're really doing something to help the app work.

Lenny (16:09):
Awesome. Before we dive even deeper into more examples, I wanted to zoom out for a moment and I'm curious just how did you even get into behavioral economics? You said you worked with Dan Ariely. How did all this come about?

Kristen Berman (16:22):
Yeah, great question. So, I met Dan around 2008 and if you don't know Dan Ariely, definitely worth a Google. And at that time, he had just written his first book, Predictably Irrational, and I was a product manager at Intuit working on QuickBooks online. So, first use, customer discovery, and really after reading the book, hearing the talk, it's just like this light bulb went off and it was like... I'm talking to five to 10 customers to inform a feature, a product, and trying to come up with some insight on human behavior. And yet, there's this whole field that studied this, that has papers in thinking and studies why we behave the way we do. And so, this was like, "Wow. I can't believe we're just missing out on it in the product community." And so, I started working with Dan. We started and now, 14 years later, it's what I do; bring behavioral insights to product teams.

Lenny (17:19):
And you said you were running an embedded team within Google to work on this sort of thing?

Kristen Berman (17:23):
Yeah. So, basically, Google... It was kind of our first mover in thinking about how important understanding behavioral science was to product and marketing development. And so, it was Dan and I in the beginning, and over the course of the three years we hired internal Googlers, we brought in more people on our team, and really were an internal consultant where we'd be pitched to other teams, work with them from start to end on a project. And now, Google has one of the bigger behavioral science teams that's out there.

Lenny (17:50):
Wow. Okay. So, you've worked with how many companies at this point, roughly?

Kristen Berman (17:56):
I'd say hundreds.

Lenny (17:58):
Hundreds, okay.

Kristen Berman (17:59):
I mean... Yeah, hundreds.

Lenny (17:59):
Okay. So, there's hundreds of companies. There's also, I imagine, hundreds of these kind of biases and heuristics and kind of behavioral expectations of people. I'm curious, out of the work that you've done, what are the most common biases, heuristics of people that you find most useful in improving product experiences in product design? What's kind of the handful that ends up being most useful?

Kristen Berman (18:21):
Totally. And there are so many mistakes that humans make and we can call them biases, heuristics. Our team uses psychologies. What are the psychologies that drive us? And so, to tackle this, our team basically has created a model of behavior change. We call the three Bs. And this summarizes the most important psychologies that drive user that are important to the product manager and the marketers. We've used this at Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, so all the companies that we work with, and they now use it. And so, the three B framework, first B is actually not a psychology, but it is the most important part of behavior change, and it should be obvious if you think about behavior change, behavioral economics, it is behavior. In order to change behavior, you have to pick a behavior that you want to change. So, companies are really good at outcomes, but just not as sharp at picking the behavior.

Kristen Berman (19:13):
When I say behavior, I mean action. The thing that you want someone to do. By the way, the only wrong answer here is log in. It's not about logging in, it's about what you do after you log in. And when we're consulting teams, it would be like... We need to get uncomfortably specific, we say. Just really specific in the behavior. So, example, if I'm Peloton PM and I'm working on the app, I would say something like, "Within seven days of somebody starting the app, they do two 10-minute workouts with two different instructors." Now, obviously that is wildly specific and you'd probably be very happy if they did one workout with one instructor, but the reality is if you don't define that behavior you're going to change. You can't actually define the psychologies that affect someone's decision making when doing that behavior. So, that's the first B.

Kristen Berman (20:01):
Second B, again, is probably pretty obvious and is very critical. It's just barriers. So, we need to reduce the barriers to doing the behavior. And there are two types of barriers we look at. One is logistical. So, this is just the stuff in our way; could be entering a credit card, could be any form field. And then, the second is cognitive. So, the cognitive barriers get in our way as well. These are things like uncertainty aversion. This is optimism bias, information aversion. These are the things that would prevent... Status quo, big one. It's just you do the same thing today that you did yesterday. Your job is-

Lenny (20:37):
Please. Can you talk about those three? Just through out there, just briefly. I'm curious about the specific biases while we're there.

Kristen Berman (20:42):
Yeah. So, uncertainty aversion, when something is uncertain or we're not... I'll give you an example of your Lyft. There's logistical friction which is wait time. But then, there's also this uncertainty of is it going to come on time? When is it going to come? And with this uncertainty, you're probably going to look for other options. You're going to open up Uber and say like, "Maybe it'll come faster." And so, when there is uncertainty in our life, we either look for other options, or we just don't make a decision at all. Right? This is, by the way, very big in healthcare where when you're very uncertain about something, you may not even go to the doctor, or you may just make the wrong decision.

Lenny (21:22):
Got it.

Kristen Berman (21:23):
And same with status quo effect where... Underlying status quo effect is this idea that we always take the path... Not always, but majority. You don't really say always when you're talking about human behavior. Human behavior is very complex. More often than not, we take the path of least resistant, that we do the thing that's easiest, and typically, the thing that's easiest is the thing that we've done yesterday and the day before. And so, when you're asking someone to do something different, which is what most product, especially startups, are trying to do, you actually have to increase their motivation or make it easier, reduce the barriers to get them to do that. And so, status quo effect is a big, big one that folks are fighting.

Lenny (22:02):
Awesome. Thanks for sharing those. Let's keep going.

Kristen Berman (22:05):
Cool. So, the third B is benefits. This is where you want to increase the... Not just benefits, but the immediate benefits of doing something. We are all present bias, which means we prioritize our present self over our future self, so there are plenty of reasons that somebody, your customer, your user should take an action, but you actually have to give them a reason to take an action today.

Kristen Berman (22:30):
So, as an example, if you're Asana, and if you're trying to get someone to log a task, the right thing for them to do is log the task because it's going to get their project done on time. You're going to have a collaborative and communicative team that you're going to want to be on. But one of the real reasons we may log a task is because of completion bias. We want to see the checkbox. We may log it because of social desirability bias where other people see that we're getting our work done. There's a notification that goes to my teammate when I complete something. So, these are the immediate benefits that we have to build into products and features to drive use.

Lenny (23:07):
Awesome. I definitely have completion bias. I love checking those freaking checkboxes. I know Asana is famous for that little unicorn confetti thing, right? For making you feel really good when you complete something.

Kristen Berman (23:17):
Yeah. I don't know how much emphasis to put on these kind of confetti stuff. I think the idea of being done is... That psychological understanding that you completed it, confetti or not, is very powerful.

Lenny (23:33):
I love confetti. Okay, so just to recap, there's the three Bs. Behavior, what is the behavior you're trying to change? And the way you described it sounds like the activation milestone. That's the way most companies think about that. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (23:46):
Yeah. I would say the activation milestone and the novel thing here is just getting really specific about this behavior, so much that if you're not arguing with your teammates, you're doing it wrong.

Lenny (23:59):
About which behavior and...

Kristen Berman (24:01):
Yeah.

Lenny (24:01):
... I imagine this often comes... Similarly to the activation kind of moment, it comes back... Working backwards from what is most likely to keep this person around long-term, kind of to keep them retained, right?

Kristen Berman (24:12):
Yeah, exactly. So, what correlates with retention and what provides an immediate value to them by doing this behavior.

Lenny (24:18):
Awesome. Okay. So, behavior, then barriers. How do you break down barriers, logistical and cognitive. And then, benefits. The point about being an immediate benefit is a really interesting one because, yeah, you may be like, "In a year from now I might earn some money, but I'm not going to do anything hard right now if I'm not going to make any money right now."

Kristen Berman (24:36):
Exactly. And so, this is a tough one because we want to believe that people really do and use our products for the end benefit, but we really need to give people the reason to do it today.

Lenny (24:47):
Awesome. I want to dive into a of couple case studies of companies that I know you've worked with. Maybe before that, I thought it'd be good to ask this question about the dark side of this stuff. I imagine people often worry about, "Hey, are you just tricking people into doing things they don't want to do? That's not good." How do you think about that line?

Kristen Berman (25:06):
Yeah, it's a great question. I think, the answer to this really, with many things in life, comes down to incentives. So, what are the incentives of the product teams, of you, your manager, the team, working on this? I like to say we are what we measure, and it really matters what you measure. I'll give you a personal example.

Lenny (25:27):
Yeah.

Kristen Berman (25:28):
LendingClub, a while ago, hired me to increase their conversion flow for borrowers. They're a lending app and they wanted to get more borrowers in the flow. The novel thing here was that they would pay me a lot of money if I hit a bump. It was like a five-point bump and zero if I didn't hit anything. [inaudible 00:25:47]

Lenny (25:47):
That was that. That's your incentive structure.

Kristen Berman (25:50):
Right. So, my incentive structure was to increase the conversion flow, and over the course of working with them, I became a predatory lender. I was suggesting things that the legal team was like, "No, Kristen, of course you cannot do that." Setting some contacts, I was at that time leading a Duke University lab called Common Sense Lab. It was focused on low to moderate income Americans thinking about their financial health, building savings apps for them. So, here I am, this kind of do good, non-profit, very focused on financial health of Americans, and my other hat was predatory lender for LendingClub. And so, it's really about the incentives that we're giving ourselves and our team that will drive how anything is used. Much less behavioral economics of these tactics, but generally, the success of your team.

Lenny (26:46):
You may not have a clear answer to this, but any advice for setting those incentives correctly? Anything you've seen work well?

Kristen Berman (26:52):
Yeah. I think for us there's two tips. One would be to set the incentive on the behavior because the behavior is going to align more with the customer outcomes than the active use or the retention. And of course... And I'm not suggesting we don't measure active use and retention in these things, you should definitely measure them, but setting the incentive, and the KPI, and the product, and the marketing team on the behavior is going to result in a more customer-friendly product and outcome.

Kristen Berman (27:18):
And then, second would be increasing the duration of the incentive. So, if you're trying to hit a quarterly outcome, you're likely going to do things that will impact the short term to give that a bump. If you're trying to hit an annual or even longer outcome, you're going to be looking out for the best interest of the company and the consumers in a little bit different way.

Lenny (27:39):
Awesome. For the LendingClub example, what did you end up doing in the end, by the way? Did she just like, "Nah, let's not do this."

Kristen Berman (27:44):
I can't actually reveal the intervention that we did, but I did miss it. So, there was a five... Wait, by the way, point, not percentage bump, which is a lot, and we got 4.5. So, we almost hit it, but it's a clip, it doesn't work that way.

Lenny (27:59):
Almost sold your soul for that bump, and you didn't get there.

Kristen Berman (28:02):
I know.

Lenny (28:02):
It seems like [inaudible 00:28:03]

Kristen Berman (28:02):
It was a good lesson in incentive [inaudible 00:28:05]. And by the way, at that point, LendingClub was offering good rates to borrowers. There was efficacy in the idea of it, which is LendingClub lending to people who have lower FIGO and with better rate. And yet, you still want to have... You don't want to become the predatory lender in that situation.

Lenny (28:23):
Okay, awesome.

Lenny (29:15):
So, there's two companies that you worked with that I use, and I'm curious what you did for them and how you worked with them. One is TikTok, and then the other's One Medical. It'd be cool to just hear what you did for them, what they wanted your help with, and then just kind of what you took away, how it went, all that.

Kristen Berman (29:32):
Great, yeah. So, TikTok is obviously a big platform, and with any big social media platform, they have misinformation on it. This is not just a problem with TikTok. Facebook and Twitter have it, and misinformation is growing. And so, they asked us to help decrease the spread of misinformation on their platform.

Kristen Berman (29:51):
There's lots of ways that we could take that, and the first thing that we did, as we kind of do with any company, is think about what is the behavior that you want to change. And so, we narrowed on decreasing shares. So, we could have said likes. We could have said comments, or general engagement which is a broad thing, but we narrowed on decreasing the shares. So, when you're actually going to see a misinformation video, we want to decrease the number of people that share it.

Kristen Berman (30:18):
So, that was the first step. The second step is, this three B model, how do we think about the barriers? With TikTok, the thing that you want to do is get people to do something less. When you want to get somebody to do something more, you make it easier. When you want someone to do something less, you make it...

Lenny (30:36):
Put up barriers.

Kristen Berman (30:38):
Put up barriers, yeah. Actually, a nice example of it's an elevator study where basically, you want people to use the stairs. And so, what the researchers did was make the elevator door close 16 seconds longer. So now, you get in the elevator, you're annoyed. It's harder to use the elevator, and people went to the stairs.

Lenny (30:55):
16 seconds, interesting number.

Kristen Berman (30:57):
16 sec... We can't wait 16. And then, it's actually kind of long, though. You're standing there [inaudible 00:31:02].

Lenny (31:01):
So long. I'd use the stairs, yeah.

Kristen Berman (31:03):
Yeah. And so, that's kind of what we did for TikTok, which is, basically, you're in a very hot state. TikTok is a very fast platform, and so we just slowed people down. Two things. There was a label on the video, which is kind of classic in the misinformation world where you tell users that it's unverified information. And the second thing was, once you click the share button, we popped up something that said, "Are you sure?" And this was basically slowing people down. So, logistical friction, and actually cognitive friction because we're asking people to reconsider a prior decision and question their self. And so with that, both those things, the label on the video and the popup, reduced shares by 24%.

Lenny (31:42):
Wow.

Kristen Berman (31:43):
And these are tactics that Facebook and Twitter are also using to slow people down. This was actually one of the first [inaudible 00:31:48] published studies that showed that this drove down misinformation.

Lenny (31:51):
Can you talk a bit about how you came to those two conclusions? I know you work really closely with the product team and there's this whole process you go through. How do you come up with these ideas? How many ideas did you test? Is there anything more you could share on that?

Kristen Berman (32:03):
Yeah. It's actually a pretty involved process. First, we did a literature review which is basically saying like, Look, we're not the first people to think about this. Let's talk to the expert and understand what has worked and what hasn't." So, with that, actually, one of the insights was that reminding people about their value of accuracy. So, most people want to be accurate. Most people actually don't want to share this information. And so, if you can remind people at the point of sharing... By the way, it doesn't work if you remind people before or after. It's at the point of sharing, that this is unverified information, studies have shown that this could decrease share. So, we took that piece. We also took the hot and cold state literature that says, "If you actually don't want to get someone to do something, how do you intervene?

Kristen Berman (32:46):
So, we did this literature review. We came up with a hypothesis, and we had probably 30 different ways to implement this because the hypothesis is just a starting point. And then, we put it into quantitative research. So, we actually put five different version of the popup in front of over a thousand users, which... We got users from Prolific, which is a platform where you can easily test things.

Lenny (33:09):
Prolific? Cool. I haven't heard that.

Kristen Berman (33:11):
We didn't measure the idea, "Do people like this?" We measured a condition against another condition. So, relatively, what condition is more likely to work than the other condition, and that would increase our intuition than it would work in market. We're not saying that studies outside of the product are end-all be-all, but it's going to drive our intuition up a lot more.

Lenny (33:34):
For the research that you did, I imagine that's a lot of the value that you and your team bring to a group. For folks that are just on their own maybe, is there any advice for how to find research on problems you're trying to solve?

Kristen Berman (33:46):
Yeah. I would say, basically, if you're looking at a new problem, it's very tempting to talk to [inaudible 00:33:53] users in the beginning. We would basically say, "Look, go spend a day on the internet googling to see what else has been done." Google Scholar is a great place to start. Hot tips would just be making sure you're searching the right keyword. So, if you're looking at something in healthcare, you'd want to know what are the buzz words for chronic care and things that would actually drive you to a meta-analysis that would summarize what's already been done. So, Google Scholar, a great place to start. And then, coming up with the hypothesis and putting them to test. We never do a UX study where we're just showing people one thing because they could really like it or hate it, but they could really like or hate all the designs. We have no idea. So, when we're doing this, we always present multiple options, and then relatively look for which one is going to drive the behavior we're intending to change.

Lenny (34:44):
Is there a reason you did UX-oriented test versus testing the product? Is it just because they weren't ready to build an experiment in product yet?

Kristen Berman (34:52):
Yeah. We actually only got two conditions in product, which for us is we would like more and it was... We don't know if we're going to get a second bat at this. So, we said, "Well, two conditions plus the control." But what should those two conditions be? So, for us, we want to de-risk the launch as much as possible.

Lenny (35:11):
Awesome. And is that feature in the product today?

Kristen Berman (35:13):
It is.

Lenny (35:14):
Amazing.

Kristen Berman (35:14):
Yes, it is in the product, and they've done more global launches as well.

Lenny (35:19):
Sweet. I am clearly not sharing misinformation because I haven't seen it yet.

Kristen Berman (35:26):
You may not be searching the right thing. If you search medical, COVID, politics, you may get it.

Lenny (35:32):
Oh, boy. Here comes the decline of me. Okay. So, next case study that I thought would be fun to talk about is One Medical which I'm a happy customer of. What did you do with them?

Kristen Berman (35:44):
Yeah. Basically, One Medical asked us to increase engagement. This is a classic question. How do you increase engagement in a product or service, right?

Lenny (35:54):
Engagement, meaning just using it more often?

Kristen Berman (35:56):
Right, exactly. That's the real question, what does engagement mean? Actually, a have fun exercise that people could do with their teams is if you ask everyone on the team what engagement means separately, you can compare answers and most likely, people are saying different things. And if you guys can't agree internally on what to do or what engagement means, it's very difficult to build a product by which your users understand what to do.

Lenny (36:19):
Yup.

Kristen Berman (36:20):
Yeah. So, after lots of debate, we came up with a key behavior to target. Basically, somebody setting up a doctor's appointment right after signing up for One Medical. This is really important because more likely than not, you're going to sign up for One Medical, six months later, you're going to get a fever and get sick, and are you going to remember this app that you signed up for six months ago? Probably not.

Kristen Berman (36:44):
You're going to do the same thing you did before, which is call the doctor that you've normally gone to. So, really important for One Medical upfront, during onboarding, to set the mental model of what they can be used for in going to that doctor's appointment. Then, we looked to the barriers. One of the barriers, like, who is going to be your provider, your doctor. Picking somebody is hard. Finding an appointment time is hard. We're all busy people. How are you going to fit it in? Knowing actually what One Medical can help you with, also difficult. Like, what is this company thing and what should I go to them for? And then, the benefits. What are the benefits? And the benefits for using One Medical is you get your questions answered immediately. It's very simple, but you can really get your health questions and issues addressed. And so, the simple intervention we did was, just during onboarding, we asked people a few questions about their health; mental, sleep, physical. We then recommended a provider. So, instead of having lots of choice, we decreased the choice, recommended them one provider, told them why, and then recommended appointment times. And limited the amount of appointment times. It was for tomorrow. We recommended a virtual appointment so it'd be a quick thing that you could do from your home. And then, that intervention, the onboarding intervention, increased bookings by 20% during onboarding.

Lenny (38:06):
Of appointments?

Kristen Berman (38:07):
Of appointments, yeah.

Lenny (38:08):
With this-

Kristen Berman (38:11):
Onboarding. I don't know if I went through that when I joined One Medical.

Kristen Berman (38:13):
This is recent.

Lenny (38:14):
Okay, cool. Yeah. By the way, One Medical's awesome. As you're talking, I'm thinking if you could think about what are the five most commonly successful changes to a flow. One right now you just shared was reducing options, which is interesting.

Kristen Berman (38:31):
Yep.

Lenny (38:31):
And then, another you mentioned earlier is just reminding you of maybe what you're going to get out of it at the end. I don't know. Is there anything that comes to mind of here's a subset of things that seems to often work when you're trying to improve, say, activation or conversion of a flow?

Kristen Berman (38:46):
I would caveat all this with behavior is contextual. Why we are religious about testing is because it's hard to drag and drop from different contents. So, I'd caveat with that. And of course, there are some rules of thumb. So, one thing, really, is about showing people the benefit right away, really not under or overestimating that people understand the benefit of your app. So, how do you get them to experience it immediately? I would say that that's one.

Kristen Berman (39:17):
And then, the other is really just the reducing... I hate to sound so simplistic, but a lot of it is about making things easier logistically and cognitively, and making the benefit much more clear, salient. We say moving it from abstract to concrete. You really want to move something from the world of people can't really imagine how it would fit in their life to how does it actually fit in their life and keeping them going.

Kristen Berman (39:45):
If it's a long signup flow and people need to drop out, how do you send them reminders to pull them back in, and then when they are back in, land them on the spot that they were at. So, Wealthfront has said one of their key insights was when people dropped out of the flow, normally they would just put people back at the beginning. That's really frustrating. If you can put people back where they landed, they're more likely to continue.

Lenny (40:11):
That makes sense. Reduces barriers. I'm learning.

Kristen Berman (40:13):
Exactly.

Lenny (40:14):
So, there's two really interesting things you just said that I'd love to dive into a little bit. One is showing the benefit of something right away. Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you did that and it worked out really well? What's an example of showing a benefit?

Kristen Berman (40:30):
There's two ways to do benefits. One is the actual one that a consumer has. So, Asana and the collaborative communicator versus maybe one that's more immediate. When we're thinking about more immediate benefits, this could actually be things like social norms where you're telling people everybody else is doing something, and to them the benefit of doing this is following the herd. We all, by the way, don't like to think that we're part of the herd, but we all will succumb to this at some point in our lives.

Kristen Berman (41:00):
And so, one example is where we worked with a company called Study. This was a FinTech app and we're helping people to sign up or sync their bank account. Syncing their bank account is a required step in any kind of FinTech app, and yet so difficult, big drop off point. Just by reframing the choices of getting someone to think about completing a step versus the benefit that would come to them after... So, the benefit of syncing their bank account was actually huge. You'd get to see your income. You're really actually changing someone's financial picture by doing it, and they're signing up for it. They know it. But the small immediate benefit is how you're framing each step. Each step is going to give you the immediate benefit. So, for this one, it was a completion bias thing again where people are motivated to complete something. Sometimes we'll do an error message if it's really important for the app to work. And again, you shouldn't do that all the time, but if it's really important, the benefit is actually decreasing that error message on the screen. We call this Right for Wrong, doing the right thing for the wrong reason, where the right thing may be completing the flow, but the wrong reason is seeing that error message go away. Again, I would use that with caution. People will not use and love your app if you're putting error messages all over it.

Lenny (42:17):
That makes sense. I think you mentioned this. I haven't mentioned, but you wrote a guest post for my newsletter. It's one of the most read posts of the newsletter on just using...

Kristen Berman (42:25):
Cool.

Lenny (42:26):
... a lot of the... Yeah. I don't know if I told you that.

Kristen Berman (42:27):
Yeah. That's awesome.

Lenny (42:29):
And it's about using these insights to improve conversion in general. So, we'll link to that in the show notes. And I think, in that post, you mentioned this concept of Right for Wrong. It might be worth spending a little more time on this, just like what does that mean and what's an example that?

Kristen Berman (42:42):
When we think about Right For Wrong, we're helping people again do the right thing... So, this is a behavior that they want to do, but the reason is actually probably not related. So, if you think about just vaccines and what we saw here, the reason to get a vaccine is to help my neighbor and prevent them from getting sick. And yet, what happened? We gave people donut, give people free pot or marijuana. There were lottery tickets in Ohio. So, this is the Right for Wrong idea where you're really substituting... By the way, one of the bigger voting interventions is just having pizza show up at the poll line. You're motivating people to go vote not because they want to contribute to democracy, but because there's pizza in the poll line. So, at some level, we're pretty simple human where we want an immediate benefit. Clubhouse actually was an interesting example of this at some level where you saw two levels of status in Clubhouse. There were the people who were friends with the people on stage, and then there was everyone else. So, that was a motivator to be friends with more people and start following people so that you could be in that little bucket of friends with other people.

Kristen Berman (43:56):
So, we're giving people kind of some other reasons to do a thing that they may want to do, but they don't necessarily have the motivation to do it right away. If you think about Peloton, yes, I want to work out. Yes, I want to have a healthy person, but maybe I want to go to the class because the instructor making a shout out, or there's some streak that I'm trying to continue. So, their right for wrong here is the real reason to work out is to improve my physical health, but while I just want that instructor to give me a shout out.

Lenny (44:29):
So, the key there, just to kind of come back to the dark side of some of this stuff, is you want to make sure the end mean is good and right, whatever it is.

Kristen Berman (44:38):
Exactly, yeah. And so, again, all these things... The possibility of using anything for negative outcomes exist, and really it's about the incentives. It's what is your incentive to drive the customer benefit, and that's really where we say you have to be measuring the customer outcomes. You have to be focused on the customer outcomes.

Kristen Berman (44:58):
Some of the toughest teams we have understanding this are non-profits. We worked with one company a while ago. We tried to get them to add a deadline because they were trying to help people sign up for interviews. So, they were basically filtering people before Staples would get them for an interview. They'd do the interview prep. They'd help them show up for the interview. But the reality is that sometimes people miss this stuff. It takes a long time to get to the interview. And so, our push to them was to add a deadline to help people show up. Sometimes we say deadlines are a gift. You're just helping people kind of prioritize this. And they said, "No. Absolutely not. We cannot add a deadline. This is just too hurtful." And the reality is when you add deadlines, and we've done this in multiple companies, where you add a deadline, more people do the thing, right? Because you're helping kind of create the right for wrong reason, giving people the wrong reason to do the behavior that they actually want to do. We added a deadline to Kiva's flow for when their borrowers were signing up and we increased their conversion. So, obviously, you can use this in ways that are unintended and it really has some upside to help people.

Lenny (46:07):
I imagine you're building this just like toolbox of ideas that end up working often at flow. I know you said that you can't just copy and paste. Rarely is it just like, "Oh, this worked at 10 other companies, it'll probably work here." But that's kind of a cool thing that your team's probably doing just making this big list of here's 10, 20 things that we could start with these ideas and talk about them.

Kristen Berman (46:27):
Yeah. Once you understand the psychology of human behavior, you really start to understand and see patterns. We started with the idea that behavioral economics shows that people act in irrational ways, but we do it in predictable ways. And so, once you start understanding this, you can really start designing for the behavior change at this kind of predictable level.

Lenny (46:47):
For a product team that's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, we can't work with you guys right now. We can't afford it. We don't have time, just generally, but I want to think about this stuff and maybe implement it on my team." What would you suggest to say a PM leading a team that wants to implement some of these principles?

Kristen Berman (47:06):
Yeah. I would probably start from the process angle. We have the three B framework, which again, the most important step is defining the behavior. So, if you were to do a workshop with your team on what is the uncomfortably specific behavior that you want to change and you align everyone to this, it's going to be much easier for you to change that behavior because the psychology that drive that behavior will be a better conversation and more obvious.

Kristen Berman (47:31):
So, first in starting with the behavior, to get everyone in a room do a small workshop. The second would be the behavioral diagnosis. And this is the toolkit in behavioral science where we study not what people say they will do, but what they actually do. And so, the behavioral diagnosis, I'd say, it's like a journey map on steroids where you're really trying to map the steps that get people to the behavior change. And again, just doing this, teams have light bulbs. And this is one of the main things that we work with teams on; we help them do the behavioral diagnosis to have those light bulbs, and then we help diagnose and design the intervention.

Lenny (48:07):
Can you talk a bit more about this behavioral diagnosis step? What actually happens there?

Kristen Berman (48:11):
There's kind of two steps. One, you can outline the full high level flow where you're saying maybe there's 50 steps in getting to the behavior, and you can do this before they hit your product, too. But when we're working with just a very kind of... We want to help a team grow their product versus develop a new product, if it's just about growing and improving the current product, we'll do a deck of 200, 300 slides of screenshots where it's just very detailed analysis of the steps that it takes to get to the behavior change. And then, we overlay the psychologies that are driving people at each step. This actually takes a really long time, but the light bulbs of how you actually get to that beha... As I said, behavior change isn't easy. It's complex. It's hard. It's noisy. And so, you have to understand the steps that get you there before you're trying to change it.

Lenny (49:04):
Wow, that sounds really useful. So, you go through the product, make a screenshot of every little step, and then connect what barrier's keeping them from progressing. Is that roughly right?

Kristen Berman (49:15):
Exactly, yeah. So, maybe in a health app, it's information aversion. They don't actually want to see their test result. That's a step, and then we attach that psychology to that step and now we can have a brainstorm about, "Well, what would help decrease information aversion to get them over the next hump?"

Lenny (49:33):
What's cool about this is you could just... As a team, you have all these things you're trying to improve, all these flows and steps and things like that, and basically, these psychologies, as you call them, are useful to just anything you're trying to optimize. I imagine there's just like a list on Wikipedia of all these human psychologies and biases. I imagine a better way to learn about this is to take your course. So, maybe it's a good time to just chat about the course that you teach versus coming in house and working with the team. Can you talk a bit about that? Or are those the same thing?

Kristen Berman (50:02):
No, that's perfect. Yeah, so we have a... Thanks for the tee up, Lenny. Appreciate it. We have a bootcamp course, which basically is a self-paced online course that you can go in and understand. It has a lot of our case studies, many of them I didn't talk about here, and we walk you through the process. You'll have an intro call with us. There's a Slack group. There's office hours really trying to help people go through the process of behavioral design yourself, and it really brings these concepts to life and helps you apply them to your product. So, I think, starting with that bootcamp is a great place for designers, product managers, marketers, researchers to start. I can send you this. We have a Sweet 16, some of the 16 biases that we refer to most. The three Bs is an easy way to evaluate a product if you're just starting, but as you get deeper, these different psychologies will pop up.

Lenny (51:02):
Awesome. Please send that and we will link to it in the show notes. Just a couple more details in this course, how often do you run it? How long does it take generally for folks to take?

Kristen Berman (51:10):
Yeah. So, once a year we'll do a cohort course that's a little bit more in depth, but the best way is this kind of self-paced course. It's a eight-week course and we give you a month extra to go through it. There's 16 modules and there's homework throughout it that you can post in Slack and get feedback from behavioral scientists. So, a pretty interactive course, but you can go through it on your own and even share with your team. We do group things. We'll do like a team of 10, and then we can give you a private office hour where we just riff with you on your product challenges.

Lenny (51:46):
Awesome. And folks can find that at irrationallabs.com. Is that right?

Kristen Berman (51:49):
Yeah. Thanks again for this.

Lenny (51:50):
irrationallabs.

Kristen Berman (51:50):
Yeah, irrationallabs.com is the spot, and if you... Probably signing up for a newsletter is also... We publish all of our research there and other kind of fun behavioral insights.

Lenny (52:01):
Sweet. Well, with that, we've reached our exciting lightning round.

Lenny (52:05):
So, I'm just going to ask you a bunch of quick questions. Whatever comes to mind, fire away and we'll just go through them real fast. Sounds good?

Kristen Berman (52:11):
Great.

Lenny (52:12):
Okay, cool. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Kristen Berman (52:17):
I would be [inaudible 00:52:17] not to say Predictably Irrational. I think this is a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Influence is also a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Many times you read Influence and you change Your Career. It's a really powerful book. And then, the under-talked about one is [inaudible 00:52:35] author Robert Frank. He wrote Darwin Economy, and he talks more about kind of status, and social norms, and how this drives a lot of our behavior. So, I'd recommend Robert Frank as an author in Darwin Economy.

Lenny (52:48):
What's another favorite podcast other than the one you're currently on?

Kristen Berman (52:51):
Science of Change is my actual podcast, so a little self-promotion. We interview product leads and talk about what they've done in their product. And then, the other one is, No Stupid Question. This is by the Freakonomics. Stephen Dubner and Angela Duckworth come together and just answer questions about behavior change.

Lenny (53:11):
What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?

Kristen Berman (53:14):
I love The Rehearsal. This is-

Lenny (53:16):
I can see you loving it.

Kristen Berman (53:17):
Yeah. So, it's basically made me feel that it's rehearsing life. And I think, sports, it's so obvious you want to practice. I just started ping pong lessons actually, and I'm doing the same stroke for an hour. But in life, we don't rehearse as much. I don't write an email a hundred times, and then practice sending it. And so, I think there's probably an opportunity for us all to learn some lessons from that.

Lenny (53:42):
Have you seen Nathan For You, his other show?

Kristen Berman (53:44):
I have, yeah. The Rehearsal was just so compelling and I'm not usually somebody who watches media, so this was mind blowing. I loved it.

Lenny (53:52):
I actually like Nathan For You better.

Kristen Berman (53:54):
Oh, interesting. Okay.

Lenny (53:54):
Yeah.

Kristen Berman (53:54):
I'll give another...

Lenny (53:57):
What a weird show, but I love it. Okay, next. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Kristen Berman (54:03):
So, interview for... I'll take this as interviews for people when we're hiring. I would caveat to say, interviews, actually we know, don't predict job performance. So, very little to no evidence would say interviews will predict how I perform on the job.

Lenny (54:19):
Shush. Just kidding.

Kristen Berman (54:20):
We use skill assessments and trials as ways to predict job performance, but interviews are good at predicting affinity and culture fit. And so, if you want to ask a question about that, one of my favorite questions is just, what is a personality trait that defines you? So, really, one that you are filled with strength, but that also can be seen as something you're working to improve. So, for me, I may be confident, but that may mean that I'm not listening. And so, we have really strong personality. People are really quick at answering this question. They really know the thing that they do good but also could hurt them, and I find that it helps understand a person a little bit easier and faster.

Lenny (55:04):
Last question, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?

Kristen Berman (55:08):
I don't know if people will know him, but Chris York. He is a behavioral scientist, designer. I would go to Chris and ask him a question, and just accidentally, in the last year, had done full research on the question and has a very thoughtful answer. Chris York wins for me.

Lenny (55:32):
Amazing. Have not heard of him. We'll look him up. Kristen, thank you so much for being here. I feel like you're going to change a lot of people's behaviors. You're going to break barriers for a lot of products. And there'll be many benefits that come out of our chat. Thank you again for doing this.

Kristen Berman (55:47):
Wonderful. Thanks for having me, Lenny. This is super fun.

# What sets great teams apart | Lane Shackleton (CPO of Coda)

## Transcript

Lane Shackleton (00:00:00):
Moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit. I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:00:51):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.

(00:01:55):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(00:02:41):
Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:03:03):
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Calm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months. By offering the most in-demand security and privacy frameworks such as SOC2, ISO 27,001, GDPR, HIPAA and many more, Vanta helps companies obtain the reports they need to accelerate growth, build efficient compliance processes, mitigate risks to their businesses, and build trust with external stakeholders.

(00:04:04):
Lane, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Lane Shackleton (00:04:07):
So glad to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:09):
It's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?

Lane Shackleton (00:04:36):
Yeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.

Lenny (00:05:09):
Okay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:23):
It's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.

Lenny (00:05:28):
Amazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.

Lane Shackleton (00:05:42):
Yeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.

(00:06:48):
So I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.

Lenny (00:07:29):
Damn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?

Lane Shackleton (00:07:37):
One is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, "Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now." Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.

Lenny (00:09:06):
Yeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.

Lane Shackleton (00:09:11):
Pre kids. Yeah.

Lenny (00:09:12):
Oh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?

Lane Shackleton (00:09:53):
Yeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.

(00:11:11):
And so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.

(00:11:49):
And then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.

Lenny (00:12:49):
Amazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?

Lane Shackleton (00:13:06):
When we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, "Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great." And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.

Lenny (00:14:11):
You said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?

Lane Shackleton (00:14:19):
We basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.

Lenny (00:15:52):
Super cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.

Lane Shackleton (00:16:08):
That's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.

Lenny (00:16:15):
Okay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:26):
We were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.

Lenny (00:16:31):
Awesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?

Lane Shackleton (00:16:38):
Maybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.

(00:17:41):
So the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, "Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh." And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.

(00:18:34):
But the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.

(00:19:49):
And to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.

Lenny (00:21:06):
There's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:22):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:21:22):
And Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:30):
Yep.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Have you read that?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:31):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:21:31):
Where it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?

Lane Shackleton (00:21:34):
Totally.

Lenny (00:21:34):
The other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, "The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable."

Lane Shackleton (00:21:48):
I love it.

Lenny (00:21:49):
I feel like you just changed art-

Lane Shackleton (00:21:51):
Yeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.

Lenny (00:21:52):
Oh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.

Lane Shackleton (00:21:58):
Yeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-

Lenny (00:22:10):
Yeah. What is that lesson?

Lane Shackleton (00:22:11):
The way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.

Lenny (00:22:55):
I was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, "I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined." And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:41):
Yeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.

Lenny (00:23:45):
Tell me more.

Lane Shackleton (00:23:46):
The prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.

Lenny (00:24:05):
Okay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:21):
Just lane.substack.com.

Lenny (00:24:24):
Sweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:24:28):
I think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, "Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?" And I'm sitting there like, "Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals." And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-

Lenny (00:25:11):
What's the cathedral story?

Lane Shackleton (00:25:11):
It was quite clarifying.

Lenny (00:25:13):
Yeah. Do share.

Lane Shackleton (00:25:14):
Yeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there." You ask the second person, "What are you doing?" They say, "Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays." You ask the third person, "What are you doing?" And they say, "Well, we're building a cathedral." And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.

(00:26:22):
So very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.

Lenny (00:27:26):
Such a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. "If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea."

Lane Shackleton (00:27:39):
Classic. Classic. It's Antoine.

Lenny (00:27:42):
That is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:06):
Probably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.

Lenny (00:28:46):
Are there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?

Lane Shackleton (00:28:53):
I mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.

Lenny (00:29:15):
I was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.

Lane Shackleton (00:29:23):
It's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.

Lenny (00:29:58):
The other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, "Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie." Or, "They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems." That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.

Lane Shackleton (00:30:30):
Yeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.

Lenny (00:31:18):
The first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:24):
And the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.

Lenny (00:31:29):
Thanks man.

Lane Shackleton (00:31:29):
You've done something very special.

Lenny (00:31:31):
I appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?

Lane Shackleton (00:31:49):
Sure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, "Oh shit, I shouldn't be here," or, "I'm under qualified to be here," those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, "Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, "Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, "It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there," then it may be worth digging into.

Lenny (00:33:04):
That is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. "The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek."

Lane Shackleton (00:33:26):
Nice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?

Lenny (00:33:31):
No. Say More.

Lane Shackleton (00:33:33):
It's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.

Lenny (00:34:08):
It's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.

Lane Shackleton (00:34:31):
Yeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.

Lenny (00:36:03):
What are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?

Lane Shackleton (00:36:10):
There are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?

Lenny (00:36:24):
No.

Lane Shackleton (00:36:27):
We've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.

(00:37:41):
And then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.

Lenny (00:38:20):
That's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.

Lane Shackleton (00:38:25):
Yeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.

Lenny (00:38:45):
And how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?

Lane Shackleton (00:38:51):
The way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, "Oh man, we got to address all this feedback." Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.

Lenny (00:39:46):
What about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?

Lane Shackleton (00:39:50):
Oh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?

Lenny (00:39:57):
Amazing.

Lane Shackleton (00:39:58):
And making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.

Lenny (00:40:04):
I imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, "Oh, Lane told us to change this thing." I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.

Lane Shackleton (00:40:21):
Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Lenny (00:40:22):
Awesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.

(00:41:21):
According to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.

(00:42:15):
Any other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?

Lane Shackleton (00:42:21):
I guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.

(00:43:25):
So if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, "Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.

(00:44:29):
And so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, "Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.

(00:45:28):
So a salesperson can say, "Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested." And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.

Lenny (00:46:45):
I love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, "Oh, wow, this is extremely cool," how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?

Lane Shackleton (00:47:15):
Yeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.

Lenny (00:48:01):
Yeah. I was going to ask.

Lane Shackleton (00:48:02):
The ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, "Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important." And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, "Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it." Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.

(00:49:03):
And so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, "This is cool. I've never done this before." Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.

Lenny (00:49:48):
Coda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?

Lane Shackleton (00:50:11):
People are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.

(00:51:06):
So I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, "Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after." Or, "Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going." Or, "No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision."

(00:52:10):
And it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, "I may have some opinions, but keep going." That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, "Just notify us of the decision after." And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, "Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later." So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.

Lenny (00:53:02):
It sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.

Lane Shackleton (00:53:17):
Tag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.

(00:54:11):
And so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, "Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind." And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.

Lenny (00:55:26):
Awesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?

Lane Shackleton (00:55:36):
One of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, "I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.

Lenny (00:56:50):
Amazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.

Lane Shackleton (00:57:09):
Yeah. I remember that.

Lenny (00:57:11):
Okay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:11):
Yes.

Lenny (00:57:24):
Okay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?

Lane Shackleton (00:57:46):
Yeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, "Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views." And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.

(00:59:04):
And so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, "You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out." Essentially.

(00:59:49):
And I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.

(01:00:49):
And I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.

Lenny (01:01:23):
It makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.

Lane Shackleton (01:01:39):
Yes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.

Lenny (01:01:46):
You mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?

Lane Shackleton (01:02:13):
That was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.

(01:03:08):
So after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.

(01:04:29):
I think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, "Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store." Or, "I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service," or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.

(01:05:21):
And then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.

Lenny (01:06:09):
Coming back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.

Lane Shackleton (01:06:33):
Let's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.

Lenny (01:06:46):
At Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, "I need to become a PM immediately."

Lane Shackleton (01:06:55):
Totally.

Lenny (01:06:56):
I think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?

Lane Shackleton (01:07:24):
Yeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.

Lenny (01:08:47):
My lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, "Oh Lane, tell us more." And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.

Lane Shackleton (01:09:15):
That's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.

Lenny (01:09:41):
The other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, "Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home." So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.

Lane Shackleton (01:10:30):
I think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.

Lenny (01:10:53):
And one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?

Lane Shackleton (01:11:08):
Yeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.

(01:11:59):
I'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, "Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire." At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, "Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.

Lenny (01:13:15):
So funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:18):
No idea.

Lenny (01:13:19):
Hoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Lane Shackleton (01:13:30):
Maybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.

Lenny (01:13:33):
Yeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.

Lane Shackleton (01:13:37):
Cool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.

(01:14:35):
And the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.

(01:15:31):
They feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.

(01:16:30):
And part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, "I don't think we should do this," or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.

(01:17:26):
I guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?

(01:18:13):
And if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, "One smiley face. We shouldn't do this." And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.

Lenny (01:19:23):
I'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.

Lane Shackleton (01:19:31):
Great. Yeah.

Lenny (01:19:32):
Awesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?

Lane Shackleton (01:19:37):
Yeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.

(01:20:43):
The other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.

Lenny (01:21:32):
I love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:46):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:21:47):
What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Lane Shackleton (01:21:51):
One that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.

Lenny (01:22:27):
Amazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.

(01:22:43):
Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?

Lane Shackleton (01:22:48):
Yeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.

Lenny (01:22:59):
Have you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:01):
No, I haven't. I got to watch that.

Lenny (01:23:03):
Ooh. It's really good.

Lane Shackleton (01:23:05):
I've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.

Lenny (01:23:11):
Classic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.

(01:23:18):
Next question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?

Lane Shackleton (01:23:22):
There's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.

Lenny (01:23:49):
Shishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:10):
Yeah. We-

Lenny (01:24:11):
Don't know if we screwed you.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:13):
I also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.

Lenny (01:24:20):
References check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?

Lane Shackleton (01:24:40):
I like that.

Lenny (01:24:42):
So feel free to steal it.

Lane Shackleton (01:24:45):
I sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, "Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent." And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.

Lenny (01:25:13):
Awesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?

Lane Shackleton (01:25:21):
A few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.

Lenny (01:25:57):
We live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.

Lane Shackleton (01:26:01):
Yeah, let's do it.

Lenny (01:26:03):
You're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?

Lane Shackleton (01:26:16):
I don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.

Lenny (01:26:58):
Beautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:03):
My mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.

Lenny (01:27:28):
Final question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?

Lane Shackleton (01:27:43):
There's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.

Lenny (01:28:24):
Lane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Lane Shackleton (01:28:42):
I'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.

Lenny (01:29:22):
Awesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.

Lane Shackleton (01:29:25):
Thanks.

## Transcript

Laura Schaffer (00:00:00):
... Like the dead of the night. And by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something on. I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the silent flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, "Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting." And I was totally geared up thinking about written, started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. An improved conversion by like 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, "What? Okay, what is going on here?"

Lenny (00:00:50):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Schaffer. The week we recorded this chat turned out to be Laura's first week in a new gig as head of growth for Amplitude taking over for a previous legendary guest, Elena Verna. Prior to Amplitude, Laura was VP of product and growth at a company called Rapid. Before that, she spent over seven years at Twilio as Head of Growth and PM lead of the growth platform and experimentation platform at Twilio. In our conversation, we dig into Laura's career growth framework and the importance of carving your own path versus waiting for one to be carved for you. We also get into a bunch of tactical and surprising advice around running experiments, making decisions on gut versus data, developing your growth strategy and how to sell your product to developers. Laura has a wealth of wisdom and I learned a lot from our conversation. With that, I bring you Laura Schaffer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account, while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high. But buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash and the US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account. You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days. Just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.

(00:03:02):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools. We're trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue You discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. An Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end e-mail marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.

(00:04:15):
Laura, welcome to the podcast.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:18):
Thanks, Lenny, it is so great to be here. Thanks for having me.

Lenny (00:04:21):
It's great to have you. So I asked Elena Elena, Elena, I'm not even sure how to pronounce her name, maybe. What is it?

Laura Schaffer (00:04:21):
Elena. You got it.

Lenny (00:04:27):
Elena. Okay. Okay. I think I've said it wrong all the time. All this time. Okay, Elena. So I asked Elena Ferna, who's a popular guest on this podcast who I should have on this podcast and you are the first person that immediately came to mind. And so I'm really excited that we're doing this and that you agreed to be on.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:42):
Well, she's the best and I'm really happy that she referred me because I'm just stoked to be here. So thanks for listening to her guidance.

Lenny (00:04:50):
Absolutely. And it's a cool time to be chatting. You're the newly minted head of growth at Amplitude and so congrats, first of all.

Laura Schaffer (00:04:57):
Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, this is my day two and a half here. So very [inaudible 00:05:04].

Lenny (00:05:06):
Wow, you're a veteran.

Laura Schaffer (00:05:06):
Yeah, right.

Lenny (00:05:06):
I love it. Some companies, there's a little percentage of that shows you how many people have joined before you and I wonder what that percentage already is [inaudible 00:05:12].

Laura Schaffer (00:05:12):
We had that in Twilio and I got pretty, pretty high up there after a while. We had a stack rank and a spreadsheet. Yeah, but it is funny. So wherever that thing exists in Amplitude, I am right fresh there at the very bottom.

Lenny (00:05:25):
So what was the number you got to Twilio? Any, do you remember?

Laura Schaffer (00:05:28):
Yeah, no, I was very proud to crack the top 50. That was my claim the same because as people left, you move up. Right?

Lenny (00:05:36):
Right. Yeah, it's bittersweet.

Laura Schaffer (00:05:39):
Well, yeah, right. On one hand it's like, "Ooh, very cool." And one of the OGs on the other hand, it's like, "Oh my gosh, this person's [inaudible 00:05:47]. Bummer." It's a shift, but I'm excited about it for sure.

Lenny (00:05:51):
So you have this new exciting role and I thought it'd be fun to start to chat about career growth and just how you think about career growth. I know you have a framework of how you think about your own career growth and clearly it's worked out, so I'm curious to hear about it and see how it could be helpful to folks that are listening. So yeah, can you just tell us about how you think about career growth?

Laura Schaffer (00:06:11):
Career growth is definitely not a straight lineup, but there's definitely some frameworks and methods that have worked really well for me. And I think to dive into it, it's first good to just talk about the one that I most typically see people use to try to grow their career and why that can be a little problematic, which is that I see most people try to work really hard the job that they have within the role that they have at a company. Do whatever you can to grow there, show your manager all these things. I see people keep spreadsheets, it wins. So it can come up with performance reviews. Maybe you try to get better advocating for yourself, maybe try to get peers to notice or your manager's peers. And that's all good. It's all stuff.

(00:06:52):
But the problem with it is that you're limited to what your manager's ability is to advocate for you, to promote you. And you're also limited by the explicit trajectory of your role at that company and where the there's room for that or not at the company. And then often that perception can sometimes be a little bit in contrast to what your perception is. And also other things that happen, your manager leaves and then you have to restart with someone else. So the method that I use tries to take that power back a little bit. And something that I learned really early on in my career, I was very lucky to learn by accident, was at a company called Bandwidth, which is my first real job. And Bandwidth is now a public company and they've done all kinds of crazy amazing things.

(00:07:38):
But I joined when it was just 50 people and I actually joined in sales and I was just hungry to make it succeed and grow and bright eyes and everything, first real job. But I realized after a few months of being in sales that I was often repeating the same thing over again, using the same thing to sell over and over again. And it's like, gosh, this isn't ideal for the customer because [inaudible 00:08:04] call me and ask these questions and get these answers and all this stuff. And it's not ideal for the company because they're paying commission on this every time. That's not going to be efficient for our growth. And because we were small, I was able to catch our GM and I was just like, "Hey, I've noticed this pattern where I'm repeating things over and over again and they're asking the same thing.

(00:08:29):
I think we should put that online. I think we should make that available so they can just see it and then buy it," because we had an online checkout process. And I was expecting him to be like, "Oh, well, I know it's important but for this [inaudible 00:08:46] another, we need to do it this way, and obviously you've thought all about it." And thinking, "Oh, I'm going to come in this new person, he's just going to help me understand what I'm missing here." There's a little bit of that that I was expecting. And he goes, "Wait a minute, tell me more about that. What do you mean?" And by the end of the conversation he was like, "Hey, why don't you go do that? Why don't you go build that experience? Why don't you put that stuff in a self-serve flow?"

(00:09:06):
And we called it e-commerce manager and it was like got a growth before this growth, this is like 2010. And that moved me into a totally new position. And the main learning that I had from that was, which really took life at Twilio and absolutely worked for me there and I'm happy to talk about that too. But the core that learning was, your executive team and executive teams at companies are often very sharp, but the nature of their day-to-day just does not link them with customers.

(00:09:34):
And that means that over time, especially as a company grows, they often lose access to some of the best insights and in the heartbeat of the people who they're providing value to in contrast to folks that are closer to the problem. And so that means that your superpower is in really pulling those insights in and bringing them to life, staying close to the customer. There's not a single leader or executive that isn't going to be stoked to hear about valuable customer insights that highlight problems they might not be seeing. And there's a lot of those. So especially when they align to North Star metrics, those ones are the powerful ones. That was the way that I grew my career at Phil and I'm happy to share that journey too.

Lenny (00:10:18):
Yeah, it'd actually be cool to hear maybe another example of that. But I think an interesting thing that comes up for me here is sometimes you may have an awesome idea and it may not immediately happen. It may not be like, yes or let's move on, that's right, immediately. And I think it's important to just recognize they're not going to follow all your ideas, but they're always looking for better ideas. And to your point, they may not have the information that will lead to an idea that you will have because you're on the ground dealing with real problems, day-to-day. So I think it's important to recognize you're not going to always get your way and that's normal.

Laura Schaffer (00:10:52):
Yeah, totally. And it's almost like building up your individual brand a little bit. And I think one of the most powerful and accessible ways is learning about your customers. There's always those people at companies who's like, "Oh, well, she just knows our customers or he just knows our customers, they just know our customers. They just know." And it's like, "Well, how?" "They just know. Let's ask that person. Let's get their feedback." And those people often have a good amount of brand recognition of powers within the company and they're often thought of when the company needs to do something new or different or if someone is hiring, maybe they're thinking about that person for a cross team thing.

(00:11:31):
So it's one of the ways that you can build that brand. And again, I think it's a sweet spot because it's something that is very valuable to everyone, all the way up to the most senior leaders, which we can talk about here in a minute. And so it's going to be valuable for you in a valuable tool no matter where you're at in your career. And that's not always an immediate payoff, but it often does give you a trajectory outside of just your role and just your manager. It gives you something a little bit broader.

Lenny (00:12:05):
So maybe a simple way of describing to mirror back what you're saying is carve your own path. Don't necessarily assume your managers will give you the path that makes most sense for you or even give you the biggest opportunity. Just propose, "Hey, I think this might be a better opportunity and I'd love to pursue it." I'd love to hear the Twilio example if that's generally-

Laura Schaffer (00:12:25):
Yeah. So when I joined Twilio, there was no growth team at all, not even a breath of it. I joined in product marketing and I was leading our product marketing for our messaging lines, but I followed the same guy that I just mentioned. I made it my own personal policy to like, hey, I'm going to do my job. And I'm going to do well, I'm going to keep notes of things I'm doing well and all that stuff because it's good, but I'm also going to get to know our customers. And I'm going to get to know our customers really well and I'm going to pay attention when I'm connecting with them, not just about the space I'm in, but just broadly what are some of the pain points and things they're articulating that are relevant to the business and what we're trying to get done.

(00:13:00):
And one of the things that came up was that users were struggling and folks were struggling to get started and use Twilio. And that contrasted so deeply to some of the things that our executive team was saying and had high conviction in our company had high conviction, which is that Twilio was so easy to use. In fact, it was top three things about Twilio that we were really trying to get out of their brand. Were so easy. Developers love us, they say we're so easy. And there were tweets coming all the time, developers saying like, "Oh my gosh, they got started in a couple of minutes." So there's all these things that made that compound and made that conviction stick. But as I was talking to customers, I was hearing a very different story and it made sense as we were penetrating new markets, adding more products, we were adding complexity and we were pulling in folks who were a little bit less motivated and those things contributed to people saying this is difficult.

(00:13:55):
And so at the time, this wasn't a 50 person in where I could just go to the floor and go to someone and be like, "Hey, there's this thing I heard about, I think we should do something." But there was another tactic that I could take, and I just started sharing a voice of the customer report. I started sharing my insights, started writing down and just sharing them. And it became with digest and eventually people were like, "Hey, can you share it with me? Can you share with me? Can you get on your list? Can share with me?" And this was in a few months of me joining, I was doing this. And then that turned into, "Hey, you should host a quarterly voice to the customer session or for all of product." And this was a request that was coming from some of the senior leaders at the company.

(00:14:33):
And when our Jeff Lawson is our CEO at the time heard about, he started attending too. So now in the session I started pulling in other people's insights too, because now they had a forum for this. I could do that and have people send that to me and I could compile it and all of these things. So then this established me as that person who knows about the customer even after short tenure. And then when came time to do annual planning that year, and I joined in 2014 at the end, so this is 2015, I pitched this idea, "Hey, we think that it's easy. It is not. Here's data that I have, the information that I have and I think that we need to start a growth team here and that needs to be a core focus." And I was able to bring in a really critical partner to that and other folks who could support that because I had built up some of that trust.

(00:15:28):
So by the time I was making that pitch, I had someone on Andre Crow who was the seventh hire at Twilio and got to number three on that spreadsheet or whatever who was really close to the CEO being like, "Yeah, we desperately need this." I'm seeing this. He led a website, he basically created the Twilio brand and he led all the website stuff and he is like, "Yeah, we definitely need this." So not only did I have that little bit of trust from the executive team, but I also had folks who were just trusted on their own advocating and supporting this that I was doing. And so it was approved just almost very easily. I put stuff together for it, but it was the meeting before the meeting had already been done by this other thing. So it helped me create the growth engineering, growth product team at Twilio.

Lenny (00:16:14):
I love just how proactive your advice is here. There's a lot of people that don't do well and then just like, "Oh, I never had the opportunity or I kept got looked over all this time." And I love that there's all this just like, here's things you can be doing to get in front of people to provide value, to just create opportunity for yourself. Any other advice along the lines of just like, here's the things you could do for yourself versus waiting for someone to come and give you opportunity?

Laura Schaffer (00:16:42):
Yeah, I think that's the most easily actual because to do all of our jobs, we need to know customers, we need to know about customer insights, product, we need to know. But then also customer facing teams, social, those want to crack into product. Your insights are extremely valuable. You're talking to customers every day more about their problems and their pain than a lot of other people do. And so that is by far and away to me the most powerful and accessible by anyone in any role in any space. But I'll also say that that broader concept of just, hey, there's things that, and things of value that you know that others can benefit from at your company and building your brand as someone that is supportive, smart, creative, able to solve problems, make sure that you're sharing that. And so maybe you're really freaking good at communicating with brevity.

(00:17:35):
I suck at that by the way. So more powered anyone that can do that, I'm actively working on it. So share that. Go to your general Slack channel or whatever and just be like, "Hey, just wrote some tips for how to do it, some ways that I am good at this." And those kinds of things can really go a long way towards people starting to view you as an SME and not just the space that you're in, but in broader areas. And that can always present open doors for you and other people are looking up to you and seeing you, someone who's strong in ways outside of just the role that you're in.

Lenny (00:18:07):
SME is a Subject Matter Expert, is that right?

Laura Schaffer (00:18:10):
Yes. Thank you for unpacking my acronyms. That's another thing that I am actively working on.

Lenny (00:18:16):
I got you. I'll be on the lookout.

Laura Schaffer (00:18:16):
Yes.

Lenny (00:18:19):
Maybe one last question along these lines is do you have any advice for framing the proposal, framing an opportunity to your manager, higher ups that you see has worked best broadly?

Laura Schaffer (00:18:34):
Yeah. Yeah. And one thing I want to say too is with this stuff, I don't think that it necessarily does counter to what your manager's doing. It's more supporting them. I've done this stuff and then it's helped my manager promote me. So it's not necessarily, "Oh, we'll do this if your manager's failing you." Or they are not the boarding you or they can't support you. It's more like do this because this is going to be an accelerator for yourself irrespective of your manager.

(00:18:55):
But then also it'll be an accelerator for your manager in supporting you because one of the things that comes into play a lot when managers figure out promotions and doing those things is they'll sit in a room, often calibrations and with a bunch of people, and it makes it a lot easier when those people have had some access or exposure or whatever to you in a positive light. So these things can all run with your manager and not against, but it's just another way of you taking back the ability to build that momentum instead of relying on all of that going through one single other person.

Lenny (00:19:33):
And what I like about your second example is you just did it. You just started doing that tenant report for the company. It wasn't like, "Hey, I have a proposal, here's what I think you should do. Should we do it?"

Laura Schaffer (00:19:42):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:19:42):
It's just like, yeah, just do it.

Laura Schaffer (00:19:44):
Yeah, ungate your knowledge I think is the buzzword that I'm hearing.

Lenny (00:19:52):
Mm. Never heard that.

Laura Schaffer (00:19:52):
I think that's an Elena, see how many times we can bring her up. But you can do that within your own company. Everybody is skilled at things that they aren't explicit to their role or their space. And I think that ungating that opens opportunities. And if you're not sure, then go to my favorite go-to, which is talk to customers, get insights. Those are incredibly valuable. So rarely do people share those when they find them. So be the person that does that.

Lenny (00:20:21):
Another area I want to chat about is experimentation and growth and data, which makes sense if strong perspectives is on being the new head of growth amplitude. So maybe we start with experimentation. You mentioned that there's a really interesting surprising result in an experiment you ran at Twilio that maybe changed your perspective on experimentation and what you think might work and not work.

Laura Schaffer (00:20:45):
A hundred percent. Yeah, I'm through a fortune of two mind-blowing experiments that really shifted the way that I think about growth. So one of them, one of my favorite ones happened very early on at Twilio. So after I created this growth team, one of the things that I saw as to me an issue was that under signup flow, we just asked people for a username and an e-mail, like a password, and that was it. And that's actually relatively common at the time. This is a while ago now, everybody is [inaudible 00:21:16]. But we didn't, and actually there was a lot of existing conviction around that. I was like, "Hey, we retarding developers. Developers, they just want to do, they just want to get their hands on things. Don't put anything in their way, it's going to be disastrous. We don't want any shenanigans here with these folks, let's just let them in the gates."

(00:21:33):
But to me this was a really big assumption to make and a very costly one. It's like, okay, if that's the case, we're not going to know anything about anyone. And we didn't know who was signing up, we didn't know what they wanted to do. And that hurt our ability to understand how people were performing from a quantitative perspective. We were a little bit lost with prioritization. There's a number of implications here, but it's obviously a very contentious space. So this is the very first thing that I did and the first experiment that I ran. I did some research to understand say, okay, what are the most important questions to answer? What would I do really, really need to know? And it was stuff like what language are you coding in, what's your use case? What product you want to use?

(00:22:14):
And then there's one around, are you developer at all or were you use something else? Because there is rumors that we're having, not just developers sign up, which is this whole other interesting story. And I think of these questions that would also potentially be things that our developers signing up would understand why we're asking that it would feel natural. But anyway, again, adding anything to the signup was very contentious, but I really just wanted to get a little bit of data on it. So I wanted to run a test. I didn't have a team, I didn't have an engineering team yet and none of that stuff had built out. It was just me, myself and I. But like I said, I had started to build a little bit of trust and [inaudible 00:22:50], Andre, who I mentioned earlier who, because he was early employee and he had access to everything, one of those people, and he also was supportive of this and had similar haunches.

(00:23:03):
And so like the dead of the night, and by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something, I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the signup flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, "Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting." I was totally thinking with written... Started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. It improved conversion by 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, "What? Okay, what is going on here?" And I actually dug into it, and what I found from just talking to a few customers once through the flow, I'm just learning about [inaudible 00:24:00] about it.

(00:24:01):
It was actually for folks, it was comforting. When you think about it, when users are signing up for your product for the very first time, it's new. This is new, that means it's scary. They're expecting it to be difficult. They're anticipating that there's going to be friction and challenges and that they're not going to figure it out. Almost like looking for the bogeyman. And that's the headspace. It's often the headspace that any of us are in when we're doing something new for the first time like ooh, this could be very challenging. And so by putting in these questions it's like, what's your language? It's like, "Oh, I do. I code a JavaScript and I can select that." Well, that's something I'm uncomfortable with. That would make my journey easier. Like "Yeah, bingo. That's my use case. Okay, I'm in the right place here."

(00:24:51):
It was actually giving folks something comforting and challenging the notion that this was going to be difficult, just the questions because it was aligning to some of the things that they were organically thinking about, which is what if they don't support my language? Or can I even do this use case I want to do? And so it was just a really interesting, the takeaway for me for this, the really interest takeaway was the psyche of the user is so, so critical. That's just as important as understanding your product and the broader market you're applying to and all those things. Just the psyche of users, new people doing things for the first time in your user flow, understanding that is powerful. And the simple catchy thing I say is that ultimately the learning here is, bad friction is bad, and good friction is good. There's no such thing as it being simple. It's just all friction is bad, which is what I had assumed going into this.

Lenny (00:25:50):
I love that you were new to Twilio and you just year-load an experiment to production.

Laura Schaffer (00:25:55):
Year-load. Yeah.

Lenny (00:25:56):
That's a big move.

Laura Schaffer (00:25:58):
It ended up being very helpful for everyone. I shared the insights from it and all these things. I've shared the [inaudible 00:26:05].

Lenny (00:26:05):
And [inaudible 00:26:05] conversion.

Laura Schaffer (00:26:08):
But for sure, use such processes with caution for sure. Yeah.

Lenny (00:26:08):
I love it. It's amazing.

Laura Schaffer (00:26:15):
That the right way to do [inaudible 00:26:15] advocating for the engineers here is the right way to make any changes in production is through or with the approval of engineering, but it was the right move overall and definitely helped business, so yeah.

Lenny (00:26:33):
Yeah, I love it. No, that's great. I like that move. I think we need more of that probably. I want to dig into what you actually... So what is it you changed, you added how many questions and then what were the questions?

Laura Schaffer (00:26:37):
There was a question around what language are you coding in? And then as an option to that, it was like, "Oh, I'm actually not coding, I'm not a developer." So for us, it actually gave us two really, really interesting data points. One was how many developers versus people who are not coding or in our flow? And then what language of the coding, which was massively helpful not just for growth and onboarding, but our documentation team, dos team. Would that end up being a critical way for us to gauge trends over time and catch things before whatever reports would come out at the end of the year, what people are doing, you start to see it. And then also product. What product are you interested in using? That was very critical for knowing the basics of how to organize someone's onboarding. Are you doing SMS? You're doing voice? To 281 or whatever. And then use case in use cases, you're doing a appointment reminders or are you doing a autoresponder or are you doing anonymous communications for a dating app or something. Right? So those were the very first questions.

Lenny (00:27:39):
Wow, okay. So it was four dropdown questions and that increased conversion. I love these examples where friction and increased conversion... There's so few of them. You hear about this could work and it's rare. And so what did you take away? What's the pattern you took from this? There's the idea, it's good friction, but is there something that you're like, what is a sign of this is going to be good friction?

Laura Schaffer (00:28:02):
There's still alleviated a problem. They alleviated the problem they had where they're coming in and worried that it was going to be difficult or that they weren't going to be able to figure it out, they weren't going to be able to get their footing. And I'd say that that's not unique to Twilio. That's something that I think users experience at any front door, at any company, any signup beginning the signup loads, it's like, "Here we go, buckle up." Especially when it's in a work context and there might be extra pressure on you to succeed or for you to make as an accurate assessment. So I think that psyche of, "Okay, am I in the right place? Is it's going to do what I need it to do? Can I figure it out? Am I capable?" These are extremely common things for people to feel when they're signing up.

(00:28:48):
And so certainly, that I think can carry out to any place. I'd encourage absolutely everybody to be putting those experiences within their early onboarding, not just for you selfishly, so you can learn and segment them appropriately, but also so the user can feel more confident as they get going and like, "Hey, I'm in the right place. This is going to do what I needed to do." But I think that the carry over there is just the psyche of the user and just being so aware that it's not so cookie cutter as, "What is the problem my market experience is and what can my product do to help them?" There's also this other thing in the room which is so important to people's success, their ability to succeed with your products and your self-serve experiences, which is, what is the mentality and the psyche of the person at the various stages in your journey?

(00:29:37):
And if you're not incorporating that or addressing that, you will absolutely miss things or things will fail and you'll be very confused as to why. We had a great experiment that I'm happy to talk about where same concept, a totally different situation, which is later in onboarding. One of the things that we tried to do over time to make Twilio less complex was to offer steps like, [inaudible 00:30:08] onboarding, welcome step one, here's what you want to build. Great, we all know that now, "Okay, step one, go do this thing. Step two, go to this thing. Three, this thing. Four, this thing. Five, bam, you're live, congratulations, aha," all these things. So we shipped that, got that out there and I was like, yeah, it was improved conversion. It wasn't like that great. It's like, man. We went from there being absolutely nothing, "Choose you're adventure, figure it out, go figure it out. Good luck." To this prescriptive thing. And it wasn't converting [inaudible 00:30:37].

(00:30:38):
So to talk to some users and there wasn't anything particularly obvious that was coming out as to what the issue was. It was like, "Oh yeah, Let's go to step one." And we did mock the people. "Okay, now I know, I do step two." But there was one thing that I was hearing that was coming out that feels like something, and that was the telephone number, the telecom part. Developers when they were coming into Twilio, it was things that were familiar to them. APIs, the language they're coding in, code samples, documentation, things like the bogeyman, the things that would psychologically trip them up, telecom, phone numbers. These things that just were completely out of the zone of anything that they'd ever worked with before, especially earlier on in Twilio's journey.

(00:31:28):
But even now, right? Telecom's very different beast for most developers. And guess what was step one? Get a phone number because that's step one. Anytime that anyone's trying to teach one to use Twilio one-on-one, always going to sit down, ask and be like, "Okay, here we're going to go get a phone number and configure it." And that's what anyone every time will do. However, in a self-serve experience, when you don't have that safe person sitting next to you being like, "Don't worry, it's going to be okay, I'm going to take you through this crazy telecom journey." They're on their own, but that's psyche telling is them like, "Oh my god, telecom. Well, I can't do that. That sounds scary. We're getting a phone number configured. Whoa, I'm out of my debt."

(00:32:01):
And so what did we do to test this out? Test out whether that was the issue? Actually, and it's first we're in the MVP. They kicked them out of the portal entirely and put them into a docs page where we could manufacture an experience where the first thing they saw was code and they're in the docs safe place, the language that they're coding in and then snuck in there.

(00:32:26):
It was like, "Oh, get a phone number, let's go configure it." Not as step one, not as the leading thing, but embedded. And the analogy I have for this is pilling a hot dog. So if anyone's got a dog or an animal you have to feed a pill to, it's like you can't just feed the pill to the animal, it's never going to happen. But if you shove it inside of a hot dog, which looks good and that's exciting, then you can get them to consume it more easily. And so this was-

Lenny (00:32:53):
Yeah. We do peanut butter, that's [inaudible 00:32:55].

Laura Schaffer (00:32:55):
Yeah, exactly, right? Yeah, hot hotdog, peanut butter, all that. You bury it. You embed the scary unpleasant thing. And so that's what you said with the phone number stuff, that telecom stuff. And guess what? Even though we're a good amount of the console and they're going off and we had no easy return button, it converted better because we were addressing the big problem that was there at the time, which is their psyche. They were not ready to come in and immediately thrown into a phone number experience. That was letting the bogeyman and out to party and that's not what was going to work. We needed to put that bogeyman pill and the hotdog.

(00:33:31):
And so then once that validated, then we can actually go through the business of putting that into the onboarding float correctly and then that could be even better. But so again, the psyche of your user is such a critical thing to be thinking about. And if something very logical isn't converting well sometimes, it means that you're battling against the psyche of a user and you want to take a step back and think about and learn about where someone is psychologically in your space.

Lenny (00:33:59):
Feels like you had this experiment that was a complete redesign of the onboarding flow and that didn't work. And then your second attempt was a different approach that's like a full onboarding flow. And I'm curious, do you have a take on just when you run experiments? And it's something we dealt with a lot at Airbnb in other places is like, do you just redesign the whole thing or is it better to iteratively work from where you're today and just experiment piece by piece towards some future much better experience?

Laura Schaffer (00:34:26):
Here's what I would say to this is that from a high level, it's always going to be better to be iterative. And the reason that it's better is that roughly 80% of the times, ORs in the time are hypotheses and the things that we believe will be true [inaudible 00:34:42]. And this is amazing. There's an amazing article out there I'm happy to share with you so you can put in the show notes.

Lenny (00:34:48):
Yeah, absolutely.

Laura Schaffer (00:34:49):
That really takes a scientific approach to proving that out. Companies like Netflix and Microsoft, there's over and over again 80 plus percent. Some companies say 90% of things fail. And so the closer you get to something that you go bear your head in the sand or go into an attic and build something for six months and ship it, the more likely it is that you are going to ship the 80% wrong stuff.

(00:35:17):
Whereas the more iterative you are, the more likely that you're going to catch it sooner. And failure doesn't have to be a wall, it can be a compass, it can be the thing that leads you to the right thing. And so you always want to as best you can, get stuff in front of customers so that you can get that compass and get that compass activated, know where to go.

(00:35:40):
So that means doing ugly things. I tell my teams all the time, if it's not embarrassing, you've gone too far. Got to be embarrassing. The first thing, that was embarrassing, kicking people out, onboarding, spend all this money and whatever to get them into your center flow, and then the first thing we do, get out of here. That's nuts. But if it hadn't validated, that would've been a very cheap but very valuable learning. Instead, it was a very powerful cheap learning in the other direction. Okay, now we know we can invest in it. We know that's the right thing to do. So always better to be iterative so that you are letting failure work for you instead of having it be a trap that you fall into.

Lenny (00:36:22):
I know that you just shared as per experiment, you're probably wrong 80% of the time. In my experience, launching a halt redesign is as negative a hundred percent of the time. I've grown weary to avoid that as much as possible, which is like, you know that, you're taught that as you go into growth and product, but you're just like, "Nah, come on, let's just make it awesome. Just redesign this whole thing." Especially your designers is always like, "No, let's start again. Let's make it amazing." But it always ends up being negative and you're like, "Okay, well, it's too late now we got to launch this thing, we don't have time to start again."

Laura Schaffer (00:36:52):
Well, it's funny, in the articles, and you'll see it was written by somebody from Microsoft who built Implementation platform and did all these cool things, as he went into actually trying to apply a scientific method of figuring out how often people are wrong about their hypotheses and what they're planning to do. He's like, "I wonder if that applies to us here at Microsoft." Even for him, that question of [inaudible 00:37:16]. And I think it's challenging when there's a lot of smart people in this space doing things and it's very difficult to think, "Gosh, am I really wrong? 80 plus, 90% of the time?" But when you think about it, makes total sense because what has to happen for something to be successful? You have to understand the problem perfectly. You have to then understand who's having the problem perfectly, the customer. At what time they're having the problem.

(00:37:43):
Then you've got to put the right solution in front of them to solve that problem. Maybe you've got the problem, all that stuff, but your solution something off. Or maybe your solution is right, but maybe it's just not presented, it communicated in the right way. You could have any one of those things off and it's not going to succeed. It's not going to have the metric impact you're expecting it to have. So in that context, it's almost like incredible. We do succeed 20 to 10% of the time given everything that has to line up. And so I think it's one of those things where you really want to go into it embracing that, "Okay, this isn't about how smart I am or how good my team is or any of that stuff. It's just the logic of this is challenging to get it right and let's embrace that and let's lean into that knowledge and make it a part of our strategy," instead of finding against it.

Lenny (00:38:39):
Have you found anything that helps you increase those odds or is just, this is the way of the world and you probably can't significantly increase the chances your experiment works out?

Laura Schaffer (00:38:51):
So here's the thing, I think there's very little that we can do to make that space easier. All those things have to be figured out. And so I definitely think that everybody is going to be in a space where their original ideas, untested ideas are going to be around that hit rate. However, the way that you go about validating those can be totally different and you can be very fast about validating those ideas and that's the key. And AB testing is one of the most expensive kinds of ways to validate an experiment. It often requires design and engineering and the PM or growth person or marketing person who's crafting it. All these things are investments that take a lot of time even for simple thing. And then you have the time factor, how long's the thing I have to run to have an impact?

(00:39:47):
So all of that is extremely expensive. And so I think the key is to just think through, "Okay, what are the things I can do to quickly validate what these ideas are that we [inaudible 00:39:59]?" And you can do that with painted doors, which is where you test rate the concept and the idea before it exists versus the actual experience. You can do mocks. If you've got a designer, create those mocks for that experience, put it in front of people, see how they engage with it. That can be so powerful.

(00:40:16):
You could invalidate tons of hypotheses at that state. The only things you want to get to that deep AB testing environment or ones that have been vetted along the way. And that way, you reduce your fail rate, because you're failing faster by using other methods. So I think I more advocate for that side. Let's fail fast by using those tools rather than figuring out a way that you can rise above where everyone else is operating and figure out ways to solve all that complex stuff better because that's going to be challenging, but you can always get better at experimenting and validating things faster.

Where do you find the best ideas come from for driving meaningful lift? Is it gut instinct type and experience bucket or is it data telling you like, "Hey, or here's a huge opportunity," in your experience?

Laura Schaffer (00:42:15):
I'm a very data-driven person. I self-describe and think of myself that way. In large part because of that, I feel you have to be constantly checking yourself and data is a really great way to do that. But I definitely think that I would be described as someone who's going more by their gut when looking at date end results just because of the way that I approach it, which is I'm very comfortable and very common in using qualitative responses and things like that and supplement to quantitative data to make a decision and that puts less of a burden on the quantitative to really make an assessment of whether something was working or not.

(00:42:51):
One of the things I see, I think sometimes goes against what other folks do, although I'm seeing things shift a little, is that 95% confidence rate. My background in college, I was in a lab running experiments or really publishing two journal and stuff and we had to have that 95% confidence rate, had to because the things that were coming out of the lab and being published were influencing things like how we do education and how we understand how bias works and when it shows up and therefore how we can combat it.

(00:43:23):
Things were wrong. And sending a bunch of bologna, that can cause some significantly bad things like false positive, false negatives in that context can be very dangerous, for lack of a better word. And you think of other pharmaceuticals, the 95% confidence rate belongs in some companies and some industries because the risk of failure on the impact of a false success is very high.

(00:43:47):
But those of us converting users and trying to upsell folks, we are very fortunate to not have that level of burden on us and we can take advantage of that. And so there are definitely times where I will advocate for and I will push for and I will myself use lower confidence intervals and 95%, especially if that doubles amount of experiments that you can run in a year. End of the day, these are all methods that we use to try to validate the hypotheses that we have. And if you're doing a 95% confidence in a role, you're still accepting a 5%, some amount of false success, do that a little bit more, challenge you to do that a little bit more. And then run way more experience. If you look at the net of what your team is doing over the course of year, what you're doing over the course of a year, you will be positive.

Lenny (00:44:42):
Wow, that is a big idea. Idea of releasing the P-value confidence interval for experimentation and data teams. Everyone would be excited about this. Probably maybe not some data scientists on teams. Do you do that? How do you act? Is that how you operate on your teams? Just like we don't need 95% competence?

Laura Schaffer (00:45:03):
So I'll say this, this is actually very critically important. You must have this game plan set before you run something. Failure mode that I see so many teams fall into is they'll run the experiment or whatever it is and then they'll make the data fit the hypothesis. Or sometimes they'll go without a hypothesis and just be like, "This is going to do better things for our metrics," but not a core reason as to why or what exactly are we testing here. And so this is another area we could absolutely fall into that trap. "Let's [inaudible 00:45:36] on good 80. I think it's good. That Laura person said it was cool. So I think that that's fine." That will always be a trap. So it needs to be very deliberately thought of in advance as a way of like, "Hey, here's how we're going to validate this." And always, always, always, if you're going to accept more risk of a false success or false positive, false negative, you want to then be really thinking about how you're going to harden your validation of a hypothesis.

(00:46:03):
For example, let's take that when we talked about with Twilio where we are kicking people out and we're sending them to the pilling hotdog experiment, and we're sending people to that experience to hide the phone number. Now in that case, let's say that we were going to accept a lower confidence interval. I would very much want to see qualitative feedback to confirm that that hypothesis was true. I want to be looking at the qualitative data from the ones where people were thrown into the existing flow and one's put into the dogs that one of them felt more confident and more like this was really easy to get through and they felt out of a territory and things like that. And I'd be wanting to hear from the ones who were in the other one, things like, "Oh, I got stuck on that [inaudible 00:46:48]." Like, "Figure this out, but it feels like it's that amount of my depth."

(00:46:52):
I would want to be looking for other things to corroborate the hard data that I'm seeing. And yes, it opens the door to whenever you open the door to more risk acceptance, you are going to have some false successes there. But all of these things together can overall make it more likely that you're shipping more things that are going to positively influence the customer. And again, I can't say it enough. It is a huge risk in and of itself to not ship as much as you possibly could in a year. That is a huge risk given that very high fail rate. So to those data scientists, and I've chatted with a few of my time, what I try to explain is that that article, that data that the 80%, that's hard data about what a detriment it can be if you don't run an enough experiments.

(00:47:51):
If you just run 10 in a year on there, maybe two around impact, two of a course of an entire year if you take that approach. So data scientists can understand, "Hey, if we do this, if we run this down, we can double or triple whatever it is, the number of experiments where we can run and overall net that's going to result in more successes that will overall net us to a positive place." You can still tell a data story to the data scientist about why you're doing this. Again, this is why when you asked that question identify, as a very data-driven person. But I think some of the methods that I use can sound at the service level as more like, "Oh, I'm going by my gut." But again, very data driven is just embracing the reality of some of the hard data that I don't think we all embrace or are even aware of sometimes about that fail rate.

Lenny (00:48:42):
This is awesome. This is a big idea. Have you written about this anywhere for folks that maybe want to try this approach at their company? And if not, you should.

Laura Schaffer (00:48:50):
I appreciate that. It's funny, it's like all my general life to do is just start writing some of this down. I have three children, one of whom is five months old, and then I have two and four. And so sometimes I'll start to write and then one of them will crawl across the keyboard. And by one of them, I mean all of multiple times. But eventually, yeah, I'll be very happy to do that if folks would be interested. I'm always happy to do whatever I can to help folks, help empower folks with knowledge to do better because none of this is secret sauce really. It's just learn from experience and it's always better to learn from others' experience than your own. It's faster. So yeah, I would definitely [inaudible 00:49:35] is that, I think that's the best that I can say, but eventually my kids will get older. I hear this and maybe I can do so.

Lenny (00:49:42):
Hopefully. Cool. So maybe if you're watching us on YouTube, leave a comment and if you want Laura to write in depth about this idea and spread it to your company. Okay, I want to talk about growth, but I have one last question just along the lines of experimentation. Is there any other just, I don't know, big lessons or takeaways of running experiments that would be interesting to share?

Laura Schaffer (00:50:02):
I think we got into this one a little bit, but I just really want to exclamation point, underline it, which is that notion of making the data wrap to fit a concept. I think a lot of teams feel and are under a lot of pressure to show progress and, "What did you do this month? Where did the metrics move?" And it can cause folks to feel like they have to do that, where it's like, "Oh gosh, this experiment." Everyone's got the experience where you run an experiment and you're like looking at the data, refresh, refresh, refresh, oh my gosh, and actually perform worse. Or it's not the same and, "Gosh, we got everyone really excited about this thing that we all worked on really hard. Like, oh my god, what are we going to say in the QBR or the monthly report?" Whatever it is that the results come to light.

(00:50:55):
And to this, I'd say this, that it's incredibly important for growth teams to educate out and for folks outside of growth and leading growth, especially to understand that the best way for a growth team to succeed, the only way really for them to succeed is to embrace the fact that they're there to validate, to understand what the biggest opportunities are and to go after them.

(00:51:24):
And that is not something that can be done on a weekly timeline, sometimes even a monthly, depending on the space you're in and what's known and unknown. And so any growth team that's beholden to short timeline wins and improvement is always going to be dangerous. That's an environment that's conducive to vanity Metric usage and massaging the data [inaudible 00:51:47]. And ones that are more successful are ones that are reporting over longer periods of time. Because I think growth team, given enough time to fail, enough time to learn the right thing to do is absolutely going to show success, real success. Not that, "Okay, we're going to make this data fit." But real moving the metrics success.

(00:52:03):
And so definitely educating out. If you find yourself in a position where you are beholden to that, share that 80% fail rate. Just math, statistics, data. You cannot be successful in an environment, but over time you can be. And so that's one thing I definitely would draw on. I end up spending a decent amount of my pie chart at Twilio and then also at Rapid where I was after that and I'm sure I'll spend some time at Amplitude as well. Just helping folks understand what is the healthiest ecosystem, most powerful ecosystem for a growth team to operate in. And time and expectations over time is a big part of that.

Lenny (00:52:46):
When you say pie chart, it's like the pie chart of your time like a big chunk of your time goes to this?

Laura Schaffer (00:52:46):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:52:50):
That's awesome. I like that. I use white charts a lot as to describe that same idea. Just to be a little more concrete there, what is the timeframe you think is the minimum for a growth team to be thinking across?

Laura Schaffer (00:53:01):
I think it's good, especially for newer teams, but even teams in general. Commit to something that you can do over the course of a year and low, medium, high is always helpful in that space. A lot times-

Lenny (00:53:01):
What do you mean by that, by low, medium, high?

Laura Schaffer (00:53:17):
Low, medium high, more like, "Hey we've got a few bets that we have or few core hypotheses." And if they take off that's going to be our high bucket like, wow [inaudible 00:53:26]. We think these things could become lightening on a bottle here, but they could also be a bunch of [inaudible 00:53:31] missed. But until we run in, we're not going to know. And if those bear out though, then yeah, that's our high. And hey, we've got a few things that we think are safer. Maybe it was validated a bit in the previous year, what have you. And these looking really the metrics this amount.

(00:53:45):
So it's helpful to give people though that construct, it deviates from it very hard deviates from this notion of like, here's the single number that we're going to hit. Just things that help people understand that space a little bit better and what to expect. And because of that it can be a little bit lumpy. There were some things that you released. Truly for the most number of years, can be easiest to talk about in this construct here, but there's one thing that we did that generated tens of millions of dollars in the pipeline, was really, really powerful and took, sometimes navigate and validate. Other times we did that onboarding stuff that I was talking about catching those things. That could happen on a little bit of a faster clip but still took some time to validate and understand. But yeah, over the course of a year you should generally be able to commit to movement. But help people understand the methods there so that they're not coming at you on a weekly basis being like, "And what did you do these past couple days?"

Lenny (00:54:44):
Okay, I got to follow up on a couple of these things. What was that big change of Twilio that lead to tens of millions of dollars?

Laura Schaffer (00:54:50):
This is part of the course that I teach at Reforge.

Lenny (00:54:55):
Oh, amazing. You get to work for Reforge with [inaudible 00:54:57].

Laura Schaffer (00:55:04):
I'm actually interested in retention, I think is my part. Right now, I'll give you links so we can [inaudible 00:55:05] in the show notes. But yeah, the high level version, this was deeper into my journey at Twilio. This is fast-forward a few years, build up this team and some cool things going on. But I was really looking for what's the next big thing for us to do? What could that be? And I noticed, remember that question very back of the day when I asked about the developer versus not developer folks [inaudible 00:55:34]?

Lenny (00:55:33):
Mm. Yeah.

Laura Schaffer (00:55:35):
We saw that little non-developer little dude ad was growing. We were actually the number of people in the ecosystem who were identifying themselves as not a developer were in the space.

(00:55:46):
But very interestingly they were, as we got more refined in our understanding of those folks, a lot of them wanted to build with Twilio. There was a hypothesis of like, "Oh well maybe they're lost, maybe this want pricing, maybe they [inaudible 00:56:00] mistake." And I was like, "Nope, they're here to build, they won't build." And they struggled through the developer on onboarding and some of them would succeed and some would... But anyway, it was all about identifying what did they need to succeed. If we were made them successful, could it contribute to dollars? One of the core learnings I'd heard from sales at the time was, "Hey, it's very challenging for us to get the folks when a developer's not involved yet to go from zero to one to get something off the ground. But man, if we can get them to do that, if I can get them in $1 and spend, I can get them to five. If I get them to five, and get them to 50, like 10,000, then I can get them to hundred thousand."

(00:56:39):
This whole long journey like, "Hey, Laura, if your team could just get them off the ground, man, we can do so much." So yeah, the journey is all about, okay, what were the things that were missing in the experience we were offering and ultimately was they couldn't write code from scratch. That was really difficult. And also we're going to stand up a server. That was difficult. But we ended up iteratively experiencing a way to validate those hypotheses and what's the right way to do this and yeah, that was great. It's called quick deploy on code exchange. Anyone can go there and deploy an app without having to write code and get an aha moment there with Twilio.

Lenny (00:57:16):
That is awesome. So basically it's like a low code Twilio app?

Laura Schaffer (00:57:20):
Yeah, it ended up being, we had a lot of pet names, nicknames for it. I think probably the one that most succinctly describes it as just, it ended up being a create your own demo experience which made you talk about the psyche of people. We talked about how developers telecom until can be intimidating. We'll talk about the non-development, sometimes the buyers or the people who are instantly buying decisions, for them, it was not only was it telco, but it was the developer stuff was inaccessible but they still wanted to jump in and they wanted to have that experience. And so this was a way for us to give them momentum, give them comfortable. Geez, I can get this running my development team, I'd definitely do it. And so it was a very powerful moment where we could really address the psyche of those users, get them excited about Twilio, and then give sales the ability to give something powerful to those non-engineering buyers and folks they're talking to.

Lenny (00:58:17):
So genius, looking back seems like an obvious win. One of my readers suggested that I start a series of the story of a feature and walk through the discovery ideation development iteration and this feels like a really interesting example of that. But anyway. I got just a couple more questions. I know we've been going for an hour now. But I have questions, I don't want to let you go just yet, and they're on growth. So one question is just you worked at Twilio, which is very product led growth. You're now Amplitude, which is more sales driven and I know you're trying to go more product led. I know Elena talks a lot about this, how every company needs to have product led motions, otherwise they're going to be disrupted by someone that comes product led. And I don't know what hires, which blanket would they fall into?

Laura Schaffer (00:59:05):
Between the AI like SLG and PLG. Yeah, for me they're two sides of the same coin. Product growth and sales. It's all to me, very thematically the same stuff. The difference is that with growth, you are selling with your product, and with sales you're selling with person like one-to-one. And so companies need to be employing both of those forces to optimally convert their audience. We're in a world where people are expecting both. They're expecting to be sold by your product and sold at the enterprise level. And large companies buy by human beings. It's going to listen to their specific needs and really break it off for them. And if you only have one, you're going to miss stuff. So absolutely, I think you want those two forces together working well. And obviously there's different stages, things work differently in different spaces, but I think when it comes to Amplitude, I think there's a huge opportunity here.

(01:00:06):
I think the key is, and that the challenge for companies that have done the sales thing and are trying to crack into the PLG thing really comes down to how you fundamentally are approaching that space. And again, your users and where they're at and the psyche of where they're at, I think a lot of companies will say, "Well okay, hey, we're going to do this PLG stuff. Let's take that sales enterprise whatever offering that we have and let's chop it up a bit and cut access here and cut out this feature here and we're going to slap this plan out and we're going to put a price on it and we'll maybe have hours of debates over whether it's like 10 99 or $104 or 75, and eventually someone will win that battle and slap it on and then [inaudible 01:00:54]." And anyway, the discussion of the focus is a lot around the product.

(01:00:58):
What are we going to do with this product? How are we going to crack it open and shift shift it in and then give it to these people, these users, these visitors? And what it's missing, I think is, and a lot of times it's easy to miss, is that when we're doing PLG and we're shifting from sales to PLG, we need to reset. We need to recognize that, again, this is sales, sales via the product. What does a good sales rep do when they're engaging? They understand what the problem is of the person in the space they're talking to. So we need the same thing here. What are the unique problems of people who are coming into our self-serve space? And I think when it comes to a company like Amplitude, a lot of the folks that will be looking to address via the PLG motion, there's a number of things we want to achieve there, but one of the primary things is to tap into the SMV market market and really give them a really startups and give them a space to land and to grow.

(01:01:57):
And again, you have to think what are the challenges and unique problems that they have because we're going to be using our product to settle them. We need to meet them where they're at with the problems that they've got. And I think one of the things that I've observed from being in all these startups and advising some startups is I very rarely... I don't think I've ever come across a startup where they have the right number of analysts for their needs. In fact, a lot of them don't have any. And so what that means is that the CEO is being an analyst to create their dashboards for the board and the product manager is being an analyst to figure out what the heck's going on and creating their boards for their product.

(01:02:34):
And that's happening all over the place is that people are in their roles and they have to be an analysts too. And I think that that's a problem that especially younger companies and early stage companies have. And so when they connect their psyche, what are they caring about? What are they thinking about when they're sending it for product analytic product or something? They're looking for something that's going to help them feel reassured they're going to be able to actually get to the bottom of the right metrics, create the reports that show things the right way. What's the best way to show churn? There's got to be a best way so many people are doing it. Guess what? Yes, there are some really good ways to do it and there are some really successful ways to set up dashboards for the board. People have done that too.

(01:03:16):
There's a lot of that knowledge that exists in one of those frameworks that exist, benchmarking. Are these numbers even good? And so, one of the hypotheses that I have is that if we take that perspective and we understand that that is the problem, that there's a number of things that we can do to really change the way that self-serve experience works to help convert people and show them how Amplitude can make them that powerful. But the thing that I think sticks across all companies, not just amplitude making the shift, is just that, that when you're doing this, do not think this is a copy paste, but chop it for parts thing. Don't start with your product when you're building at your strategy, start with your customers, your users, your prospects, the people who are going to be coming into yourself or flow. Make sure you are understanding how their problems differ because they do from the people that you're addressing at the sales led side. And then make sure that you're orienting your experience of product around those people.

Lenny (01:04:12):
It's interesting that you almost have to start again as a product company, as a product because you may need to solve completely different problems that eventually lead to the same place. But it's interesting what you're saying that you may end up targeting analysts or PMs. I know Amplitude or has always focused on PMs, but-

Laura Schaffer (01:04:32):
Yeah, it's right. And there's always nice thing about it is it's in some ways, it does feel like you're starting fresh because you do need to start with the customer again and what's their problem. But in a lot of ways, you can carry over a lot of the same knowledge. At that point you know what's working well. Amplitude for example, does have a ton of knowledge around what some of the best ways artists set up reports. There's a lot of things that they have the momentum going, like where do you choose that momentum and how do you put that and curate that in front of users and make sure that they're getting the right things. There's a ton of momentum already there. It's just a little bit about harnessing it and understanding like, yeah, where are the gaps because there are going to be gaps.

(01:05:08):
But anchoring in a customer problem as I think the way that you start any new product, any new thing that you're releasing, should always think about the customer and the pain point. So no different than when you're doing PLG for the first time or cracking into it. You need to be thinking again, starting again with the problem, the problems they have, the psyche that they have coming to your space so that you can build something that is going to effectively make them feel like, "Oh you can solve my problem, you get me." And show them how your product's going to do that.

Lenny (01:05:42):
Final question, and this is around developers. You worked at Twilio, obviously Twilio sold developers. I think Rapid where you work right before Amplitude also sold developers. Selling to developers feels like such a hot space right now. There's so many startups that are just building developer tools, such a huge market. Used to be not. Used to be like there's not a market in developers. They're not going to spend money, there's not enough of them. And now it is a big popular spot. And so I'm curious, what have you learned about building a startup and a product that sells to developers? I imagine a lot of founders building search tools would be really curious.

Laura Schaffer (01:06:16):
The first is that developers are just a very different audience from any others. I've seen so many people who have come in strong on growth really well or product really well with other audiences and like, "Oh, I'm going to take all those learnings, I'll pivot into serving developers." And as it being a very steep climb because developers are so different. And let me give you a couple just fun facts that make them really different. And some of these have some interesting stories. One is developers, almost two, one, do not look at your marketing website at all. They go straight to your signup flow. So what that means is all that beautiful context that you're setting and the product aid pricing, all that stuff, very often they're skipping all of it context free and going straight to your signup. And so anytime you make an assumption like, "Oh, well, they probably know this coming in to signup." Or like, "Well, we don't need to include, that's on the marketing website." None of that's going to apply to this group of people.

(01:07:15):
They're there. The analogy I have for this group is they're the IKEA buyers who when IKEA package comes, they're not opening up the instruction manual and reading in and then starting to go through, they're in there tearing open the bags and starting to pull the pieces together and trying to build it. They'll come up for context and steps and such when they get stuck if they're motivated. So that's one thing. And then another one is just the aversion to talking to sales. And I think hearing that, some they're like, "Oh yeah, well, I hate sales too." When I'm sent out and get bombarded by sales, that's the worst. I totally get that. But developers are on this whole other level. There was a fang company sign up for Twilio, built a POC, launched to production, all this, and operated in that space for months without engaging once with sales.

(01:08:12):
I was trying to reach them and I ended up being the one that talked to them first because they reached out to support because there was something about their delivery that was off ,there missing a feature and they did not want to talk to sales. They ended up talking to me when I was in product marketing. And that was my first exposure of like, these people not want to talk to sales. And then there's another one where a giant retail company where the engineering team signed up with their personal e-mail addresses so they wouldn't get bombarded by sales. It was only later that we found out. Anyway. But the thing that's most important, these are fun facts, but the thing that I would say is the most important, the thing to leave with listeners here is what makes them so different?

(01:08:54):
Why? What's the deal here? And it stems from their charter and their responsibility. So if we put ourselves in developer's shoes for a minute, a developer, if a developer is required to use your product, especially if they're the primary user, the primary builder, it's really important to recognize that they're responsible for that. If your service goes down, that's their responsibility. Not just for themselves but their team. If the pager wakes up someone because the service they bought from you goes down, that's on them. If, oh, it turns out that doesn't work with the systems that they said it was, well, that's on them. Doesn't integrate with the data the way that everyone wanted it to? That's on them. Everyone lives to developer when it's not working right and it cannot work right. In so many ways, that's their failure, it can cost them their job, it could cost them the trust to their team.

(01:09:50):
It cost them their reputation. And that means that the stakes are very high for them every time that they're adopting something new. So they can't afford to take someone's word for it. Especially a sales rep who might have some other motivations from their perspective, they can't afford to trust your content or someone's word. They must do it. They must prove it themselves. And so that's why, for developers to be bought in, they need to do something, build something, a proof of concept at the very least, if not moving further than that. And so that means they're going to be pretty darn deep in their self-serve experience with you before they're ready to commit. And so if you are a company that is providing, that requires developers to build, you must invest in self-serve experiences in order to effectively convert your audience. And you should be thinking of them. Something akin your self-serve function and growth folks, someone akin to Salesforce because your developers are not going to accept sales coming in and trying to convert them at that stage.

Lenny (01:11:00):
I love that you always come back to the psyche of the user and how in this case, developers like, here's why they're responsible for this thing. Salespeople are going to convince them this is going to work. And it's not. That's a really interesting tool and that's a really cool takeaway.

(01:11:16):
Is there anything else that we didn't cover before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:20):
Plenty. I think we covered it all, man.

Lenny (01:11:22):
You got all my questions and more. So with that, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:30):
I am so ready.

Lenny (01:11:31):
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Laura Schaffer (01:11:35):
I'm a big believer in happiness. Not just being crunchy or we should all be happy, but also because it helps us do our best work and we're more creative and all this. So one is Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins. I don't ignore the data, that money is something that often gets in the way of our happiness. I know so many smart people that just have not figured out the whole managing their finances thing. And this book will cover all of your basics. It's very easy to read. He's got an audiobook that he narrates himself. Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, he's fantastic.

Lenny (01:12:12):
What's a recent movie... Oh wait, wait, there's more?

Laura Schaffer (01:12:12):
Oh, there's one more.

Lenny (01:12:18):
Oh, let's do it. Let's do it.

Laura Schaffer (01:12:18):
[inaudible 01:12:18] Happiness, which is Atomic Habits by James Clear. If you ever want to change something about yourself or something's not quite working for you, this guy will give you a framework to change it. Guaranteed.

Lenny (01:12:30):
I really enjoyed that book. That guy's killing it. He was on Tim Ferris, he had a great interview. Folks that don't want to read it, they could listen to that. There's a lot of cool tips there. Favorite recent movie or TV show?

Laura Schaffer (01:12:39):
Unabashedly, the Great British Baking Show. I love that show. I love that show for all the reasons everyone loves that show. It's heartwarming and makes you feel good and uplifts you. But also because it is a competitive show. They're trying to be the best baker and they're out there helping each other. They're like a big family. Most reality competitive TV shows that I see, all of them are like cutthroat, they're sabotaging. So I'm just endlessly fascinated also by the psychology of what's happening here. I want somebody to do a research paper on it, get to the bottom of why they're all helping each other. It's wonderful though. Wonderful to watch.

Lenny (01:13:18):
Interesting. I always comes back to psychology with you.

Laura Schaffer (01:13:24):
I know. I know. I feel like I'm really, really sinking deep in there. And it's true though. It's very interesting to me, and I love that show.

Lenny (01:13:30):
What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask in interviews?

Laura Schaffer (01:13:34):
I love asking about a ship or release that is not cherry-picked by the person you're talking to. You can get it a lot of different ways. The thing is, everyone has a big success story. Everyone does. It really doesn't actually tell you very much to ask someone like, "What's a great thing you released?" Because everyone could tell that. Instead, take that away. What's the most recent ship is a really easy one because recency, time. But there's other things you can do to take that out. Just give them specific parameters for a ship that they've shared or whatever, and that will allow you to listen more and learn more about their frameworks versus the outcomes. Because if you're picking a random ship, odds are it probably wasn't fantastic. So they're going to want to talk more about how they approach getting there and that's what you want to know about to know if they're going to succeed, what their frameworks to how they approach things.

Lenny (01:14:24):
That is cool. I've never heard that one. That is a really clever idea. What are five SaaS products that you use in your day-to-day work? Can't say Amplitude.

Laura Schaffer (01:14:33):
I know, right? Still learning which ones we have here. But yeah, I'll just share the ones that I like a lot that I've used elsewhere. So one is Hotjar. Hot Jar [inaudible 01:14:44] also works. Just anything that allows you to put some quick little thing in front of customers, get that qualitative feedback we talked about. It's a critical, critical supplement to quantitative data to understand what's really causing the change or not causing the change [inaudible 01:14:58]. So that's important. I will say Amplitude is a fantastic tool that I have used and I would've said that if I hadn't just joined Amplitude so I got to use it... I know. I got to use it for the first time at Amplitude and it was awesome. So again, like asterisk, because I'm like working there now, but I do actually like it. And Slack, it's boring, everyone says Slack, but I just have to hand it to them.

(01:15:26):
It makes life so much easier and just nod their way. And then Builder, which I'll also put in asterisk on that one, but I really want to serve this. A lot of people don't know about it and it's really helpful. I do advise them so I'm in their corner. But this is another one I also say would be a powerful one. I think a lot of team gets stuck. They're relying on too much in their engineers to make changes. Again, we talk about rapid experimentation, getting these out, out, out. And Builder makes it really easy for folks to do that. Also, a headless CMS, you can drag and drop headless CMS so they do make it easy for non-engineers to make changes. So especially if you're trying to figure out how to get around that 80% [inaudible 01:16:11] that I mentioned, this builder would be a good way.

(01:16:14):
And then yeah, if you want one more, I'll give you Chat GPT, which is really boring and everyone's saying that, but I think I'll just say I don't have any crazy things to say about it except that I do think we all need to figure out how we pull that in to [inaudible 01:16:28] put people who don't do that are probably going to lose out or smart AI whatever bots. But that would be it for you, Lenny. But if you ask me in a few months after I've actually been an Amplitude for a bit, I'm sure I'd give you a different answer.

Lenny (01:16:42):
That's a good time to plug lennybot.com. And I wrote a newsletter or Dan Shipper who created the bot wrote a newsletter post about how he built this thing. And so you could go ask me questions using the content of my newsletter as answers. And it's very cool. Lennybot.com or lennysbot.com.

Laura Schaffer (01:17:00):
Amazing.

Lenny (01:17:01):
There we go.

Laura Schaffer (01:17:03):
I didn't know about that. Well, there you go. I've changed my answer. It's that.

Lenny (01:17:05):
Yeah, there we go. That's all I need.

(01:17:09):
Two more questions. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?

Laura Schaffer (01:17:17):
Yeah, the be embarrassed thing, like I mentioned earlier, be Embarrassed by the first iteration. If you are not embarrassed, you've gone too far. That really speeds up ships and helps people celebrate the unpolished as opposed to feel embarrassed about it. So just embracing that.

Lenny (01:17:35):
Awesome. And final question. I know you just started Amplitude, but do you have a favorite pro-tip for how to use Amplitude or maybe Hidden Feature people may not know about?

Laura Schaffer (01:17:44):
You tell me [inaudible 01:17:45], but I'll say one thing that was super cool actually that someone put together on my team at Rapid, literally before I left, he put together a video of how powerful Amplitude could be when linked up and integrated with other things like in this case Hotjar and Segment. There was a Amplitude report that someone had created and there was something that was an anomaly happening there. Users were using something in a way we didn't expect and Amplitude one of the reports surface it, but Al Kirsten, we want to know why is that happening. And so we could find out what the event is and then using by Segment, find out what that name was and look at Hotjar and actually go in and get screencasts of people doing that exact event.

(01:18:30):
And from that, we were able to form some really concrete hypotheses about what actually was causing it. And so obviously talking to customers is very powerful, but in this case, just that simple use of connecting and threading those technologies together could really get a good picture of that without needing to engage customers. So the tip would be how you can really amplify when you get an amplitude when you use it with.

Lenny (01:18:59):
Amazing. Laura, we covered a lot of ground, career experimentation, growth, embarrassment, psychology. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe send you an appreciation or two? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Laura Schaffer (01:19:17):
Yeah, find me on LinkedIn. I don't post a lot. Yeah, I'll blame my three children. Eventually, I promise that I will. But I'm pretty good about responding to messages, so definitely link with me there.

(01:19:29):
And then what listeners can do, I think I'm always happy to hear feedback, suggestion, all that, but I'll just say I also know that it's a little bit crazy out there right now, especially folks working in tech. So I'm also cognizant what I might be able to do to help all of you. I know there's a few places I advise and rapids hiring. I know of a few folks that are hiring growth, strong growth people and product folks. So if you are interested in learning more about that, don't hesitate to hit me up. I want to make sure that I help as many people as I can in that respect because it's trying times and I'm sure you've heard it and read it, but if you're laid off, this is not about you, it's not your fault. It's this crazy world we're in. Things will get better. And I would be feel very lucky if I could help even one person land. So feel free to hit me up about that too.

Lenny (01:20:21):
Awesome. And maybe if you share some links, we could include links to open roles in the show notes.

Laura Schaffer (01:20:26):
Yes. I know there's a few that don't have JDs open yet. They're that hot off the press, but I'm happy to surface a few things there for sure because I know that makes it easier for people to know.

Lenny (01:20:37):
Awesome. We will do our best with the show notes then. Laura, thank you again for being here.

Laura Schaffer (01:20:43):
Yeah, thanks so much for having me. This was awesome and so much fun.

Lenny (01:20:47):

# Mastering onboarding | Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth at Airtable)

## Transcript

Lauryn Isford (00:00:00):
An activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.

Lenny (00:00:24):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauryn Isford. Lauryn was most recently head of growth at Airtable. Before that, she was a product growth lead at Facebook, working on user growth, internet.org, and growth of Facebook at India. Before that, interestingly, she led growth for Blue Bottle's e-commerce business. In our conversation, we dive deep into Lauryn's favorite topic, onboarding, why it's one of the biggest and most undervalued growth levers, what she's learned about optimizing onboarding flow through her work redoing Airtable's onboarding flow, what she's seen work and common pitfalls around onboarding, plus a ton of advice around figuring out your activation metric. I could talk all day with Lauryn about growth, but we had to cut this off to keep this to a reasonable length. Enjoy my conversation with Lauryn Isford after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

This episode is brought to you by public.com, who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated if you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, you can access your cash whenever you want, even before your Treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your Treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield, and you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a Treasury account at public.com/lenny.

Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours and mine. I have a quick request, head on over to my board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guest you'd love for me to have on in 2023, and while you're on the Miro board, feel free to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to work closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and iterate quickly and easily on anything you're working on. For example, in Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team sprints. Your whole distributed team can come together around a wireframe and draw ideas with a pen tool or even put mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made template, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmap to customer journey flows, final mocks, you get the picture. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.

(00:03:27):
Lauryn, welcome to the podcast.

Lauryn Isford (00:03:28):
Thank you. I'm so excited to be here.

Lenny (00:03:31):
We've chatted a bunch over Slacks, like all these different Slacks we're in and Twitter and emails, but we've never actually chatted real time, and so I have a million questions that I want to ask you. So, thank you again for being here.

Lauryn Isford (00:03:42):
We have never chatted real time, so everybody's getting the first conversation and I'm really looking forward to it.

Lenny (00:03:48):
I know that you have this pretty spicy contrarian take on experimentation and that I think you believe people run experiments too often and maybe not everything should be an experiment. Can you talk about that?

Lauryn Isford (00:04:00):
Yes. So, experimentation is a really big part, growth culture, growth hacking culture, PLG culture, growth marketing culture, any kind of growth, at least in my sphere, and sometimes teams can be really, really dependent on experimentation when trying to grow a business. A great example of this would be consumer growth at scale. Think your classic big social company. I worked at one of them. I am a former employee of Meta back when it was called Facebook. When you're at scale trying to grow a social app, experimenting can feel second nature. It can feel like a necessary step in your product development process that you want to drive more signups or you want to drive better activation with new customers. So, you change some buttons, change a design, and A/B test it, and then see if numbers go up or down, and then make your ship decision based on it.

(00:04:56):
I find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, "Hey, I increased activation by 7%." So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things. So, experiments can be expensive.

(00:06:09):
So, with all that said, generally my advice is to experiment when you need to and to primarily see it as a risk mitigation tactic when you're making dramatic changes and to let the product development process do more work. So, spend more time with customers, be more rigorous in understanding precisely what problem you're solving, get mocks in front of people and see how they react, and hopefully have more conviction than you otherwise would when you ship something that it's okay if every customer sees it tomorrow and that the experiment doesn't actually matter as much.

Lenny (00:06:44):
It's so interesting hearing that from a head of growth person. Working at Airbnb for a long time, and you talked about this, there's so much value put into the amount your experiment moves the metric is so important to, like you said, your performance review, your team's status, your team's ability to show they were successful. People look at like, you drove this metric 14%, which oftentimes you add up from experiments you've ran. How do you work in a culture like that, or is it just in that culture you may as well run experiments because that's the only way you get credit for the work you do, or is there a way to just be like, "Wow, that is how we measure it, but it's still maybe not worth running everything as an experiment"? How do you kind of find that balance?

Lauryn Isford (00:07:29):
It feels to me like that is the default culture, especially as growth teams become organizations and as those organizations grow with companies into growth stage public company territory and beyond. However, I do think you can build a different culture, and the only way to escape the trap of experimenting everything is to have a very intentional culture about doing right by customers and doing the right thing for the business. A growth team or a growth org exists in service of improving the business and delivering results for the business, and whether or not you measure those precisely in an A/B test, you still shipped them or you didn't.

(00:08:09):
So, the rigor around your process was either there or it wasn't. This means though that there have to be other ways to motivate, reward, retain, and develop really good talent. So, a culture around the impact you had on customers as measured by qualitative feedback or as measured by deals that were closed or deals that weren't lost, or other kinds of indicators that you did the right thing for customers is important and there shouldn't be, especially in engineering within the world of growth, a culture around having to point to numbers to demonstrate your impact because if there is, then the team will biased experiments all the time, and that's not necessarily the right thing for the business. It's a very expensive cost.

Lenny (00:08:50):
Wow. It's so wild hearing this from, again, a head of growth, someone that's so analytical like you. Is there an example of something you launched that maybe most people would've run an experiment and you decided not to for one of these reasons?

Lauryn Isford (00:09:01):
There is a feature, a product really, that Airtable offers called Airtable Forms. It's possible you've used it. I'm not sure if you have, but-

Lenny (00:09:10):
No, I don't think so, but I will go check it out.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:12):
You can check it out. There are some new features I'm about to tell you about, so maybe that will entice you.

Lenny (00:09:16):
There we go. Scoops.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:18):
So, Airtable Forms is much like other forms products. You can create a form and then send it to anybody to submit. The people who submit your form don't need to be a user of Airtable.

Lenny (00:09:30):
Oh yeah, I have used that. Okay. It's just like the turn an Airtable into a form. Yes, I've used it. Okay.

Lauryn Isford (00:09:35):
Exactly. So, something we noticed is that there was a gap in feature parity for Airtable Forms where the submitter could not request a copy of their submission. So, I might send my T-shirt size to Lenny for a form around ordering swag for the company and then I might want to remember which T-shirt size that I ordered and get a copy of that in my email. We created that feature which as a result was gated on creating an account with Airtable, and we just turned it on and wanted to see what would happen because we knew from rigor of a wonderful product team doing robust customer analysis and also doing the data work that this is something that people wanted, that it was a feature that would bring value to customers, and that even if it didn't move certain metrics like a signup percentage, even if it might affect the mix shift of activation rate from folks who signed up, it would be net good for customers who were using forms and who were submitting them.

(00:10:35):
So, we did roll that one out without an A/B test. It did have a big enough impact on our signup metrics that we saw at top line and didn't need the A/B test to see what was happening. And we also were able to use attribution to make some analysis possible after we rolled it out so we could learn from what was happening to the base afterward.

Lenny (00:10:53):
Fascinating. That's a really good example, and I imagine that helps a lot when the head of growth is encouraging the team not to run as an experiment versus a PM on a subteam, like, "Nah, we don't need to run this as an experiment," because in that case you're already acknowledging that team, "You did a great job, look at this metric. Clearly this one moved. Clearly customers want it." So, to your point, basically this kind of stuff has to come top down probably for it to work well.

Lauryn Isford (00:11:15):
I think it does, and it also cannot be an excuse for rigor around building well and being precise in what customers need, but overall, if you can be a results-oriented organization that just wants to do the right thing and move with urgency, then in my opinion, that's the way that you can have the most impact.

Lenny (00:11:33):
Cool. Okay. I didn't expect to spend that much time on that question, but there's so much there. That was really interesting. What I want to spend the bulk of our time on is onboarding. Something that I found myself, and I think you agree with a lot of this but I'll confirm, is that I've done a lot of research into the growth stories of the most successful startups, and what I find, one, is that retention ends up being the thing you got to crack. If you can't crack retention, nothing else matters. And then, two, more interestingly, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest levers to increasing retention which basically A then B equal C, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest areas of opportunity for growth teams both early on and late stage. And so, I guess the first question, would you agree with that general sentiment that onboarding is this huge opportunity and often undervalued?

Lauryn Isford (00:12:22):
Yes, I definitely agree. It depends of course on the shape of business. Not every business should prioritize onboarding first, but if you have some sort of self-serve element of your product, if someone can give your product a try, maybe you have a playground or a sandbox demo, if there's a premium element to your pricing scheme, if you maybe offer things totally for free and don't even have monetization yet, onboarding is that first really important choke point that from which downstream of onboarding so many important metrics and results flow for the business, from converting someone to a paid customer to closing a deal to growing, how many people in an organization are using your product. So, all of that really comes back to onboarding and if you can get that right, lots of good things will follow.

Lenny (00:13:13):
Okay, great. I'm glad we agreed. I already know this, but you spent a lot of time on Airtable's onboarding flow.

Lauryn Isford (00:13:20):
Yes.

Lenny (00:13:21):
And so, I'm curious just to learn about what did you do over the time that you spent optimizing Airtable's onboarding experience, what kind of impact did you see through the work that you did there, and then just any big kind of general takeaways that either you think people should know or that you'll take with you to future opportunities around optimizing an onboarding experience?

Lauryn Isford (00:13:43):
We could talk about onboarding all day. This is one of my favorite things to chat about recently. So, we did have a wonderful activation team rebuild Airtable's onboarding flow over the past 12 to 18 months. This included many projects, including several big ones. So, what you've probably experienced if you signed up for Airtable recently or what you might experience if you create a new account soon is we've built an immersive wizard that we called Guided Onboarding that helped guide you through setting up your first workflow on Airtable, and in doing that reduced the cognitive load of getting started, helped you make more progress faster, and created scaffolding that more than 90% of customers would benefit from to be able to get up and running on a product that's pretty complicated. That was the first piece.

(00:14:39):
We also then introduced some personalization to use case on top of that. So, instead of helping you build something generic, having you build something that's relevant to you. And then we also worked on ongoing education. So, once you're in a workflow, once you've built something, how do we help you level it up to go from beginner to intermediate to advanced? One funny anecdote about this is that we actually called that project The Mole, M-O-L-E, because the design pattern in product looks like a mole. It pops up from the bottom of the screen and gives you tips as you're exploring. So, those are some of the biggest changes we made. We did retire a bunch of our tooltips which were a big part of onboarding for a really long time. So, happy to chat more about that, and then also did a bunch of more incremental optimizations as well. In general, tried to take a portfolio approach to what we did.

Lenny (00:15:36):
Cool. Okay. A few questions real quick.

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
Yeah.

Lenny (00:15:38):
What were the three buckets real quick? So personalization, ongoing education, what was the first one?

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
The first one was guided onboarding.

Lenny (00:15:38):
Guided onboarding.

Lauryn Isford (00:15:38):
Exactly.

Lenny (00:15:46):
What was the impact of this work, just to give people a sense of the kind of impact you can have on conversion and then whatever other metrics you looked at there?

Lauryn Isford (00:15:53):
We were working on activation for a few years before I arrived at Airtable. There was already an awesome activation team, hard at work. Overall, the investments we made in onboarding over about a six to eight month period that included the wizard, The Mole with ongoing education, and also some personalization together drove a 20% lift in activation rate for Airtable.

Lenny (00:16:20):
Wow. That sounds quite impactful, especially at a company at that scale.

Lauryn Isford (00:16:24):
It's awesome. I would say celebrate any clear statistical significant improvement in activation rate. It's a big victory, and credit goes to the team that really spent many, many hours with customers and designing precisely to build something that could have that big of an impact. I think it speaks to the importance of really understanding what a user needs to be onboarded well, which is not the same as what your business wants the user to be onboarded to. So, delineating those and building carefully is really what made it successful.

Lenny (00:16:57):
Which of these three buckets would you say had the biggest impact? Because I want to kind of get a couple levels deeper to get to what exactly did you do that worked really well.

Lauryn Isford (00:17:05):
I would say that the guided onboarding wizard which is the immersive wizard that helps you figure out how to get started was the most impactful thing we did.

Lenny (00:17:14):
And it's interesting that you had tooltips and this feels like a tooltip-y thing. What is it conceptually? What's the simple way to think about the onboarding wizard versus a bunch of tooltips telling you like, "Hey, Lauryn, click here, next go here, and then check this thing out"?

Lauryn Isford (00:17:26):
Totally. Imagine being in a step-by-step guide where you are asked question, for example, pick which kind of project you're working on, pick what kinds of things you'd like to track for this project, and then as you select from beautiful, easy-to-click buttons that require very little work on your part, something is visualized for you on the right half of the screen. So, you can see your workflow visually come to light as you do the work on the left half of the screen, and all of this is done for you in a very guided and instructive way.

Lenny (00:17:59):
Are there any generalized learnings from that experience of just how to do a great onboarding experience? It sounds like probably avoid tooltips, instead just kind of ask questions and show them progress as they're going through it in kind of like an immersive experience versus here's the product, check out all the cool features.

Lauryn Isford (00:18:18):
I think there is something to be said for reducing reliance on tooltips, but I'm not sure I would go so far as to say the tooltip is dead, as much as I maybe would like to because there are too many of them out there. The reason for this is that I do believe Airtable's customers had a very specific need which was that the effort required to build basic scaffolding was too much and they needed more support, guardrails, bumpers to help them through that, and this kind of guided or immersive wizard was the best mechanism we could come up with to reduce that effort required and to make them feel more supported in their journey. I'm not sure that this pattern is one that works for every product. I think it's one that works well for a complicated product, where figuring out where to go next and how to get started is actually very challenging or has a high cognitive load.

(00:19:14):
So, I would keep that in mind, but in this case, it did work really well for us. I have seen some other products in the wild adopt similar patterns which gives me confidence that it is transferrable beyond Airtable and that there's probably something to it. That's definitely a big learning. I think one other big learning for us was that we had to meet users where they are. We have some awesome advanced features of really cool stuff you can do with Airtable, automations being a great example. However, users don't necessarily need to get that started on day one. They don't need to learn about the advanced stuff when they haven't even looked at a workflow before. So, we really worked hard to prioritize what the user actually needed and to consider what was necessary education versus what could be ongoing education and building it up.

Lenny (00:20:06):
Can you talk a bit more about what that was? What did you actually do to understand the type of user, and then what did you change for them? Because we actually did something like this at Airbnb, and it was a tiny bit successful for host onboarding but it wasn't anything big. And so, I'm curious what it is you specifically did. Did you ask them a few questions and then grouped them in a group and then changed the way the rest of the flow went, or, yeah, what'd you do there?

Lauryn Isford (00:20:31):
Good question. So, at the very, very beginning, we sort of said new users broadly need help. Who are they? What do we know about them? How can we help them? We spoke to a bunch of customers and also watched them get started and looked for patterns in behavior and also clusters. So, someone who is familiar with databases, somewhat technical and prefers to and has experience in building things might have a different need from onboarding than someone who is exploring a tool that was recommended to them for a project minute. With that in mind, there were some clear segments of personas or buckets of users that we could split out to give different experiences. Now that said, when we rolled out the guided onboarding wizard, it was actually just one generic onboarding that was one-size-fits-all, and while escape patches are great, we felt like we could solve, as I think I referenced earlier, more than 90% of use cases or users needs with one generic onboarding to start and then we could personalize from there.

(00:21:34):
When we started to personalize, generally we found bucketing customers by their learning style and their building style was more effective than more classic segmentation, like do you work in marketing, do you work in product management, do you work in operation. The reason for this is that there are many different types of building or workflows that are possible in Airtable. Some are sophisticated for use at work, some are simple for use at work, some are somewhere in between and are for a hobby use case or a consulting use case. Knowing how someone would go about building was more effective than what do you actually want to see on the other side.

(00:22:19):
This means that something like a template which can give you an example of how to build a use case for project management can be helpful for inspiration but might not actually be the best way to teach you how to use a product like Airtable, when instead, we could learn that you're someone who needs more familiarity with databases to be able to get to the next level, or who might need a more visual learning experience instead of a more data-forward learning experience. So, we tried to segment the experience that way and found that that yielded better results on activation than some of the more traditional segments.

Lenny (00:22:52):
And how did you decide which segment that a user was in? Was it a question you asked them right at the beginning?

Lauryn Isford (00:22:57):
We had a really awesome research team that would do some surveys and conversations with customers away from our production experience and away from individual projects. So, we had a really robust read going in to the project of who these different personas were, different building types, different learning types. That said, we do also ask folks when they sign up some questions and depending on who you are or what we might think we know about you or want to know about you, we might ask you different questions and that's in service of helping you get started.

(00:23:27):
I had some big ideas for how we might bring this to life even further that might come to life in the future, such as if somebody's there to just help out, if they're may be a teammate rather than a builder, if they're just there to work with someone else because Lenny invited Lauryn to work on her table because he needed Lauryn to do something or update a sprint, whatever. Lauryn needs really different onboarding than Lenny. So, actually getting that data in the flow is really useful because then we can route customers to a fully different experience. It's amazing how much low-hanging fruit there is to personalize and segment that onboarding experience in so many products that are out there. You just need to be really detail-oriented and precise on who you're working with.

Lenny (00:24:11):
You talked about this experience as activation, and so just digging a little bit further into that idea. One of the important kind of metrics, milestones you got to figure out when you're working on onboarding is what is an activated user, what's the activation milestone, what's the activation metric. I know you have some strong opinions and some really interesting insights into activation milestones based on your experience at Airtable. Can you chat a bit about that and just share what Airtable's activation metric ended up being?

Lauryn Isford (00:24:37):
Yes. So, overall, every growth team needs a north star metric. It's so important to have singular focus on what the business results are that you are working to drive in your team. On our activation team, which as I mentioned focused on onboarding, though in theory there could be other ways that you want to focus on driving activation, we had one north star metric which was what we called our team activation metric. So, this representative, a team of people were activated on Airtable's product and using it in a way that suggested they would be long-term retained. For us, that was week four, multi-user, meaning in the fourth week, more than one person on that team is active and contributing to a workflow on Airtable.

(00:25:23):
This metric is something that our wonderful analytics team determined to be highly correlated with long-term retention. It's also a metric that holds a relatively high bar, so it requires a number of things to be true, that something of substance has been built, that people persist and continue to collaborate, that they're collaborating on a weekly cadence, and also holds a relatively high bar on exactly how they're contributing, meaning that the sum total of this is somewhat hard to achieve which means that we have a hard job and also a high bar as an activation team to achieve that for as many customers as possible.

(00:25:58):
In general, I think an activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.

Lenny (00:26:22):
I really like that heuristic. So, the idea there is when you're picking an activation metric, you want it to be in the single digits potentially because you're saying that's more likely to be correlated with retention because retention's probably pretty low long term. Is that kind of the rough idea?

Lauryn Isford (00:26:38):
That's a rough idea. Of course, the metric should be correlated with retention no matter what, but if 40% of your customers are still active at week four maybe with a metric that would be week four active rate, then only a fraction of those are still going to be active in month 12, in month 18, and month 24, and I would much prefer to pick a more specific, more precise metric that maybe only 5% of users reach, but know that those 5% of users will be with us for the long haul, and if we could get that 5% even to 6% or 7%, it would have huge downstream effects on long-term metrics for the business. So, that's why I would opt for a more specific metric.

Lenny (00:27:22):
Okay. So, this activation metric, week four multi-user active is a really interesting metric. Can you talk a bit about how you actually operationalize this and put this to work on your team to help people understand what to work on and make sure they're moving the right sorts of numbers?

Lauryn Isford (00:27:39):
Totally. So, one of the first things that we did when me and my team started to revisit week four multi-user active right before we started to rebuild onboarding is break that metric down into all of its component. So, if you really think about what goes into that number, how many teams sign up as a team versus as an individual, how many of them make it to week four, how many of them have more than two people invited versus more than two people who've ever been active, versus more than two people who were active in the fourth week, maybe they have one person active in the fourth week, and then what does active mean, and what are the different kinds of behaviors that constitute contribution or being active. Doing that really detailed work on the metric helped us understand what levers we could pull to have a really big impact on activation overall.

(00:28:34):
Additionally, we actually started using more metrics. So, we didn't just use our activation rate metric week four multi-user active to make all of our decisions. We introduced a few more, and one of them with purely a retention metric for an individual. Are you week two retained? Are you week four retained? The other was what we called Build with a capital B, and this was roughly a sophistication score. So, for someone who's building something, have they reached sort of intermediate levels of use of Airtable? The reason why we added these metrics is we were building new mechanisms for onboarding that were helping users build more effectively and find more value in Airtable, but sometimes those treatments helped users become more sophisticated but didn't help them invite more teammates, or sometimes those new mechanisms made someone more interested in giving us a shot for a few more weeks, but what they built was actually not any more impressive than if they had done it on their own.

(00:29:38):
So, this group of metrics actually really set us free. It gave us those constraints where we could actually measure success in a few different ways and think about activation as being more complicated than just a single metric and celebrate anything we could do to help on a couple of dimensions. So, I know it's a little unconventional to have a few metrics that you work with, but we did find that that was really helpful when we were making big changes.

Lenny (00:30:04):
That is actually really interesting. So, it makes it feel like the core activation metric you talked about was more of an output metric and you kind of realized here's the things we could actually be moving directly. Is that roughly how you thought about it?

Lauryn Isford (00:30:15):
Exactly. It also helped us grapple with some of the tensions we felt which I know a lot of teams working on activation and onboarding feel, which is picking one metric doesn't paint the whole picture of what you're trying to achieve when you help a user onboard to your product and when you educate them about what's possible. So, in having sophistication and retention and an element of team use all as part of the fabric of how we talked about activation, it made us much more well-rounded as a team.

Lenny (00:30:46):
That connects a bit to, so we worked on this post together about how to choose an activation metric and you shared part of this story for that post, and there's a little bit of a debate amongst folks that contributed their opinion on how to decide an activation metric, where it's a debate between is it okay to have a workspace activation metric where it's like how many boards somebody creates, how many Airtables somebody has created versus a user action, like user has created 10 tables or user using it two times a week. I think you're on the side of workspace is maybe a more interesting metric for a collaboration tool, and it's interesting that you end up with both in the end which I think is kind of where folks landed. You probably look at how's the company using this tool and then per user, are they using it consistently. So, I guess the question is just what's your take on user specific activation metric versus workspace level activation metric?

Lauryn Isford (00:31:39):
I really like this question. I agree it is a great debate. I'm not sure there's a clear answer because it does depend on your product. In the case of Airtable, which is a product that has seat-based pricing and generally horizontal adoption, it totally makes sense to have a workspace activation measure because you want to understand in an account, in an organization how many folks are actually using a product and finding value. That can be different for tools that might look like Airtable but have different mechanisms for growth or different pricing or different vertical personas that tend to adopt it. So, I do think there is some variance. I do have a reaction to share with you that's a little spicy-

Lenny (00:32:19):
Please.

Lauryn Isford (00:32:20):
... is that it's important that growth teams are agile and this means that north stars, key metrics, focus metrics will change, and if you're working on the same metric forever, there's probably some inefficiency in actually chasing the biggest impact for the business. So, I would be open-minded about if a workspace or team or account activation metric is always the right thing to focus on. Team activation looks really healthy because your growth team did some really amazing work on it, maybe user retention is the right place to focus next year. Maybe it's more about conversion. Maybe it's more about some other signal for long-term retention, and I would be open to being dynamic and changing that metric over time. Stability in metric is great, it helps with momentum, it helps with building expertise, but sometimes we overfocus on picking the perfect north star metric and by the time you feel like you've found the perfect one, it's actually time to move on to something different and work on a different opportunity.

Lenny (00:33:24):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and then set you to north star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(00:34:34):
Is there an example of that that comes to mind when you talk about being a little stuck on a metric? Is that something you went through at Airtable or anywhere else you worked?

Lauryn Isford (00:34:43):
I've gone through it plenty of times. We actually at the organizational level on the Airtable growth award changed our north star metric a couple times which is a big deal that manifests for several teams. Roughly the arc of that change for us was shifting from being a growth org focused on revenue to a growth organization focused on user growth and customer growth. This for us was a really important moment where we decided that it was most essential in our work to grow the business to bring millions more people onto the platform, using the product and finding value in the product, because we were taking a decade's long view that they could always become monetized or converted customers later, and there wasn't really a rush. We felt that focusing on revenue led us to make some decisions that were a bit more short-term oriented than would be ideal.

(00:35:39):
There's also a dynamic here where in the world of enterprise SaaS, the world of B2B SaaS, there's a new theme called product-led sales that's very hot right now, and this means that often in a PLG company there's some ideal end goal of handing off certain customers to have a sales conversation or to close an enterprise contract. In that case, you might actually prefer to delay revenue for months or quarters or years to manifest it later, and when that's the case, your growth team should be fully aligned in lockstep with sales and with go-to-market team and focusing on user growth is actually the right call. So, that's an example of a big pivot that we made, and in doing that, we felt more strategic clarity and were able to move faster.

Lenny (00:36:25):
That is an awesome story. How long did that process take and any advice for folks that might be going through a similar journey of maybe we should rethink our north star metric not and not be revenue? Any advice there?

Lauryn Isford (00:36:36):
In general, I would say having stability in north star metric for at least six months feels like table stakes to me and that's for the reasons that I cited before, for building momentum, for building domain expertise, and also for compounding impact in areas where you see success, where you notice growth flywheels that you can optimize. However, if you're reaching a point where that north star metric feels like it's old news, maybe you're outgrowing it, maybe you want to work on different things, I think that's great. Be open-minded about changing it up. I would generally try to start with the mechanics of the business and what you think you might be able to drive in terms of metric impact with the resources you have on your growth team. That can look different for every growth team because some of them have marketing, some are more product and engineering, some are kind of a mix of both or even something different than that.

(00:37:27):
So, I would start with what impact do we think we could have? Where do we think the biggest opportunity is to chase? You can literally draw a funnel on a whiteboard and map it out and brainstorm together, do some analysis on the side, and when you see what opportunity feels like the most important thing to chase, try to build a north star metric that reflects the output of that work, rather than drives all of your decision-making from the beginning. A north star metric should really be a measure of what you plan to do, the strategy you plan to deliver is delivering results for the business on the other side, rather than the other way around.

Lenny (00:38:05):
So, you mentioned trials and freemium at one point and I want to spend a little time on this, and I know you also have some strong opinions about this kind of debate. Another debate people have, there's always debates in growth, between offering a trial or offering a freemium product, self-serve, and I think your perspective is you should do both, and I think maybe you call it a reverse trial because I was doing some research. So, I guess is that true?, Is that how you see the world, and then just generally, why do you believe that that is the right approach?

Lauryn Isford (00:38:31):
What is it about all these growth people with their strong opinion?

Lenny (00:38:34):
Right?

Lauryn Isford (00:38:35):
I guess I have so many of them. You're educating me on my own perspectives today. Freemium and free trials. So, to get on the same page with definitions for all of our wonderful listeners, a free trial is when you can use the product for free for a limited time and then your only option beyond that limited time is to pay for use of the product. Freemium would be when there are multiple options for how to use the product and one of those options is an infinitely free version of the product. So, you can use Airtable for free forever or you can pay some amount and have access to premium features.

(00:39:14):
So, with all that in mind, personally I'm in the camp of offering a reverse trial. Funky name, but what that means is offer a trial but also offer freemium. Do both. The reason why I like this is you get an opportunity when somebody shows up and says, "Hey, I'm going to give your product a try today," to show them everything that's possible. Onboarding is a huge component of that. Help somebody get started, have those aha moments and experience initial value, but also this is your moment to showcase everything that can be done with your really cool product, and you have some limited number of days, maybe seven days, 14 days, 30 days, to showcase all of the cool things that your company is building for your customers. That is the beauty of a free trial. It's not just that someone can try your product without paying. It's that they can try even more of the product, all of the premium, amazing advanced offerings that could be possible if they decide they want to settle on a premium plan.

(00:40:17):
When you are deciding if this is something you want to do, I would actually take a big step back from looking at competitive pricing pages and getting into the details and reading blogs and just think about what your philosophy is as a business on monetizing customers. The reason for this is generally the reason to offer a free plan or a free trial but really a free plan, the freemium type of pricing model is if you value letting millions, tens of millions of customers give your product a try, even if they never pay you a dollar. That shows to me prioritization and value of user grab, brand awareness, and exposure of your product more than just revenue. And if that's the case, a freemium pricing structure can be really great for your product, and it give you the space to see if your product can become that household name that everybody is familiar with and can give a try and get some early value and even experience some aha moments.

(00:41:24):
On top of that, you can offer a free trial to show what's possible with premium value and then that really can just be focused space for you to say, "Hey, look what's possible if you pay us $5 a month, $10 a month," and you might even get some extra conversion out of that and some more paid customers. So, in general, that's how I think about it. I like the reverse trial because user growth is important and if you're in a long game where you're trying to grow a business for a decade or more, ideally you're trying to get millions of people onto your product and you can always have that monetization conversation later, but you only get a couple moments where you can say, "Hey, pull out your credit card or let's get on the phone and talk about an enterprise contract," with a customer before you lose trust or lose patience. And so, that focus on helping them discover value and build loyalty to you is much more important.

Lenny (00:42:13):
I really like this concept, a super cool name too. I'm also thinking back to some of the SaaS tools I've used that have had this where I go straight into the pro plan and then I'm like, "Oh, I don't want to lose all these features," and then I actually end up buying it. So, when I'm hearing this, it sounds to me like it's a better version of the freemium approach. I imagine there's still many SaaS tools that are very enterprise-y, take handholding, maybe this goes away. I know Elena Verna who's been on the podcast is just a huge proponent of everyone will be product-led, self-serve eventually, but until that day they're still like, I don't know, I think of Retool I think is very hands-on, handhold-y, front I think is like that. There's all these tools that people don't get really quickly.

(00:42:57):
And so, I guess do you still think there's a need for some of these tools that need sales and customer success involvement to stick with just trial at least for now, or do you think they should all kind of find a way to get to self-serve and a reverse trial?

Lauryn Isford (00:43:12):
I do really agree with what Elena said. I really look forward to the day when self-serve and freemium are possible for every product, but I also recognize that that can be really expensive to build and implement and is not for everyone. So, that's cool too. There are other options. In general, I think freemium and also free trials tend to be most effective when there's something that the person who signed up can actually do on their own without being handheld. It doesn't have to be full functionality. It can be exploring a sandbox or a demo or something they can poke around in and experience value, see that aha moment. That's great. That's a moment where you can give value to that person who's chosen to spend time with your product. If that's not possible, there are different ways to be creative that don't require having premium pricing. You can think about how to use concepts related to PLG and related to top of funnel adoption in different ways.

(00:44:16):
So, maybe you can create custom landing pages or experiences that help showcase value without a full signup or free plan or free trial experience. Maybe you give folks the ability to sign up and while they've sort of signed up as an interested customer, they're not fully experiencing things, they might not even have the option to pay for something yet, but they can learn. There's some resources. There's some education for them to experience. Or, maybe you can think about top of funnel adoption or traffic as being most helpful for extension within customers you already. So, if you've signed contracts with a couple really large Fortune 500 companies and somebody wants to join and signs up on your website from the same email domain, then you can provide an experience for them that might feel like it helps them learn the mechanics that's actually only available to folks who are part of organizations that already have contracts with you.

(00:45:19):
It's a different way of thinking about PLG and not necessarily something you would offer for free, they're already an enterprise customer, but some of those concepts can still have a lot of value and help you grow the footprint of an account in an organization, and those are definitely awesome things to try if you can't offer something self-serve.

Lenny (00:45:36):
So, what I'm hearing is find ways to make things some component of it self-serve so that you don't need to necessarily talk to someone immediately. They can start to understand some element of it on maybe an interactive planning page or some very simple part of the product.

Lauryn Isford (00:45:50):
Exactly. I think the key is to figure out what it would be like for someone to experience value when there's no human sitting next to them, and that value doesn't have to be full functionality of the product.

Lenny (00:46:02):
Awesome. Coming back to onboarding, and this is my last onboarding question, I have another topic I wanted to touch on. Do you have any just general pieces of advice, either probably this will work if you're working on onboarding/things that probably won't work and are common traps that people fall into when they're trying to optimize onboarding activation flows in general?

Lauryn Isford (00:46:26):
I do see a very common trap that I would love to caution against, which is that employees of a company build onboarding for customers, but they build what they think customers want rather than what customers actually want, and that manifests in an onboarding experience that's not very helpful. So, there are two patterns that I typically see. One is naming features. So, imagine you're using Airtable for the first time and you see a tooltip and it says, "This is automations," and it explains what automations is to you. That's not that useful for a user who doesn't really know what's going on yet because they aren't sure if automations are relevant to them, if they're suited to their use case, what exactly the word automation entails. We've named a feature, but it's really sort of an announcement of something awesome that Airtable built, rather than an application that can help educate the user on how they'll receive more value from that feature. Try not to name features. It can be very tempting in practice, even though it sounds easy in theory.

Lenny (00:47:32):
Before you move on, what have you learned about how to actually name things in such a way people understand? Is there some you do there?

Lauryn Isford (00:47:39):
Ooh, naming things in a way people understand.

Lenny (00:47:41):
Versus the feature name, like you just said.

Lauryn Isford (00:47:43):
So, instead of that, I think what would be more useful, given the constraints of using a tooltip that's pushing someone to try an automation would be to explain how the automation is relevant to them, or even better, to enable a one-touch turn-on of the automation feature or set up an automation to complete your workflow where we actually do some of the work and if you click into here, we will show you what value is possible and help you get it to the finish line. So, really focusing on that contextual application or helping to drive towards an outcome, rather than just educating on a name.

Lenny (00:48:23):
And there's an element of smart defaulting, just like starting to do it for them versus do you want this or not.

Lauryn Isford (00:48:29):
Exactly. There's also an element here of segmentation or personalization where you should be sensible about if everybody needs to know what an automation is or if there are only certain folks who actually need to learn about it and others might not need to know.

Lenny (00:48:42):
Awesome. All right. Back to your other suggestions.

Lauryn Isford (00:48:46):
Oh yes, there is one other suggestion which is if you're working on a SaaS product, especially a freemium product, there's probably some pricing and packaging scheme that explains which features are available for free, which features are not, how many you get, and sort of maps out usage of the product, both for free users if you offer a free plan, and then for premium users if you offer premium plans. I find sometimes teams working on onboarding will map onboarding to that pricing or packaging. So, for example, maybe automations, to use the same example of the same feature, is something that's generally premium, that if somebody uses automations they're more likely to be a paying customer. It can be tempting then for an onboarding team to try to push automations to people when they're getting started because of course, we'd prefer if customers use premium features because then they might be more likely to become premium customers, but that is not in the best interest of educating a user on how to get started.

(00:49:44):
So, I do think it's very important to be careful that you are rooted in the customer need and rooted in helping that customer achieve maximum value, rather than sitting in the priors of what your packaging scheme might suggest or what might be in the best interest of the company.

Lenny (00:50:02):
As a growth leader, how do you operationalize that? Is it set some drag metrics? Is it just philosophically, let's make sure we're optimizing the right metric? What's worked to actually avoid that problem?

Lauryn Isford (00:50:15):
I think north star metrics help because a team can be singularly focused on the most important result for their roadmap and their charter. However, guardrail metrics are equally important. So, an onboarding team that builds amazing onboarding that causes a 10% drop in revenue would need some sort of guardrails to make sure that they knew that that might not be the right trade for the business, and importantly, should have the rigor and passion to go deep and understand what caused that drop in revenue and figure out what it was about that onboarding that ultimately caused a guardrail metric to suffer. So, with that in mind, I think guardrail metrics can be very useful and are important to choose wisely. I love working with strong analytics partners on a growth team because rigor and education around how to think about guardrail metrics is something that we should always be thinking about, whether you are a data analyst in functional specialty or a PM or an engineer or a designer.

(00:51:19):
So, that's how I kind of like to think about it. I do think guardrail metrics help and then just being well reasoned and thinking about what's best for the business and speaking about your work as being what's best for the business and the customer overall, rather than being too narrow in your own swim lanes of what you work on.

Lenny (00:51:35):
Great advice. I want to shift to a different topic and this will be much shorter. You have this really cool framework for thinking about the PLG funnel, product-led growth, and interestingly kind of trickles down to the team you build, metrics you choose, and things like that. So, can you just briefly talk about just this framework that you use to think about PLG growth in the PLG funnel?

Lauryn Isford (00:51:55):
When I think about how to grow with PLG in a business that has some element of PLG, self-server, freemium, I usually start with a funnel that roughly maps to the same scaffolding, regardless of business. Whether I've worked on the business, whether I'm supporting the business as an advisor, I love starting with this framework. The first step is join, the second is evaluate, the third is upgrade, and the fourth is expand. This funnel represents the journey of a customer in a PLG product as they advance and develop in their lifetime of using the product. It starts with becoming a part of the account that's using the product or signing up, and you might join because you found Airtable on Twitter or you might join because Lenny invited you to use Airtable. So, there are different ways that you can join that product in the first place.

(00:52:55):
Then importantly, you evaluate if it's right for you, and that word choice of evaluate is deliberately not onboard or activate because it's about what the user needs to see that they are going to get the value that they want in using your product and in building a habit around it. Next is upgrade. Ideally, someone has gone from beginner to intermediate or even advanced in their ongoing education and in getting to know your product over some amount of time and they see premium value and raise their hand and say, "I will convert to it." Now if you offer self-serve premium plans, that's awesome. They can do it with a credit card right in the product. Sometimes this means raising their hand to talk to sales and that's great too, but they upgrade to some sort of premium experience or to more value than what they have when they got started.

(00:53:43):
And finally expand, and vertical says this can be nuanced but with more horizontal tools. Ideally, a few folks, maybe one, maybe a few are using a tool in an organization and then many more adopt it over time, and that expansion drives net dollar retention, it drives brand awareness, it drives more usage in more pockets of the company, it is awesome for renewal rates if you're working with enterprise contracts, and ultimately then also brings new referrals into the product that loop all the way back to the beginning at join.

Lenny (00:54:19):
I love it. And what's cool is upgrade and expansion kind of bake in retention. You're not going to upgrade, you're not going to expand if you're not retained. Can you talk a little bit about how you use this framework? Do you bucket? Do you have these four teams on your growth team that focus on each of these stages? Is it more of a conceptual framework? Do you come up with KPIs for each of these steps? How do you actually operationalize this concept?

Lauryn Isford (00:54:40):
I think this framework is a step to abstract to represent exactly how you should structure your teams or to be represented with four metrics, for KPIs. However, it's a really good conceptual way of grounding your team or your organization in the mechanics of how machine that is the business you work on run. From there, it can become much easier to communicate with each other on where you see opportunity on specific pockets of the product that might be impactful. So, for example, you might be working on a strategy related to landing pages and be able to name that that's going to help drive joins in new organization, and that's a really awesome way to communicate why you might invest there versus investing in something related to onboarding that would help with evaluate.

(00:55:32):
So, I love this framework because it helps everyone communicate clearly and also you can derive from it more specifically what are the opportunities that are relevant to us with this framework in mind, and then revisit it over time to gut check if you feel like maybe what you're investing in now is a bit outdated and needs a refresh, or if there are other pockets of the business that need more attention that you might be able to work.

Lenny (00:55:58):
Can you talk a bit about how you structured the growth team potentially based on this framework and just generally how you thought about building the growth team at Airtable?

Lauryn Isford (00:56:06):
We had what I think is a pretty relevant set of teams. If you're thinking about building out a few in your own product or organization that focuses on sort of a PLG shape of business, we had one team working on acquisition and they were really responsible for the join. So, they mapped actually really well to this funnel. One team working on activation and they mapped pretty closely to evaluate. It wasn't a full representation of what's possible in evaluate. We were pretty focused on the self-serve business and that was different than, for example, helping an enterprise customer evaluate the right offering for them, but that activation team was most closely tied to that second step in the funnel.

(00:56:50):
And then we had a monetization team that worked on monetization and pricing and they mapped really closely to the upgrade part of the funnel. They did touch some other things as well. So, they worked on churn prevention and downgrades. They worked on some billing related projects, but in general, they were most thematically aligned with that upgrade step of the funnel. One area that is more emerging that's interesting is expand. So, when we got started on Airtable growth, we didn't have a team dedicated to that expand piece and it became increasingly interesting to us over time as we started to notice that larger companies were using the product. This meant that there was a bigger opportunity than there had been before to really help drive expansion and get more folks using the product in those accounts. That's an area that emerged later. That's a really good example of revisiting your priors and being resilient or agile in your org structure because it wasn't something we set out to work on initially, but it became a really clear opportunity later.

Lenny (00:57:53):
You mentioned that Airtable is thinking a little bit more about B2B growth versus just kind of B2C where I think it's been historically. Can you talk about that and just how you're thinking about that?

Lauryn Isford (00:58:04):
B2B growth is an emerging space for growth practitioners and hobbyists like me because the playbook hasn't been written the same way that B2C growth or consumer social growth has been. It's a new space, and there are quite a few companies that are really excited about exploring B2B growth and how to apply the DNA and the mechanics of a growth organization to more of that B2B motion or to working with more upmarket customers or enterprise customers. So, it's very top of mind for me. It's a active conversation in the growth community, especially in San Francisco. Overall, I'm really excited to see what we can do by applying this approach to growing businesses, to new types of businesses. It will require some differences in execution model. So, in B2C or in consumer social as two examples, you can experiment at large volumes or you can make changes that impact thousands or millions of people pretty easily.

(00:59:15):
In B2B growth, generally you're working with a much smaller set of customers and also the risk profile can be very different because smaller numbers of customers that represent larger percentages of your company's total revenue must be treated with absolute care, as opposed to a world where you might have millions of folks coming through your product every day and small changes might not have as big of an impact. In an enterprise organization, it's important to be very careful and rigorous and to prioritize that customer's needs all the time. This means that rigor, that customer conversations, that beta testing, that live prototypes and demos are significantly more important and that face time with the customer is significantly more important than it is in B2C growth. So, we'll see what happens. I'm really excited to see more folks who have given growth a try in B2C or in consumer spaces try applying it to B2B because it will become increasingly common in the industry.

Lenny (01:00:19):
Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'll go through it pretty fast. Are you ready?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:27):
I'm ready.

Lenny (01:00:28):
All right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:34):
Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger. I give this to new reports on my team. Great book to read when you're thinking about your leadership style, and Rocket Men, really fun story. I love a good story about ambition and achieving awesome things.

Lenny (01:00:50):
What's a favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?

Lauryn Isford (01:00:54):
I like Fifth & Mission which is a local San Francisco podcast on local politics.

Lenny (01:01:01):
Favorite recent movie or TV show that you have watched that you've really enjoyed?

Lauryn Isford (01:01:05):
I really like the White Lotus Season 2. White Lotus was very fun to watch. I also, on the movie front, I'm in a habit of watching Best Picture nominees every year and last year there were a couple movies I really enjoyed, one of them was Belfast.

Lenny (01:01:22):
Oh man, that was an intense movie. I watched that recently. And also, if we should turn this into a drinking game, every time someone mentions White Lotus, we drink. It's an amazing show, but it's definitely comes up often. So interesting.

Lauryn Isford (01:01:35):
Comes up too much.

Lenny (01:01:37):
It deserves to come up often. I love it.

Lauryn Isford (01:01:39):
That's true.

Lenny (01:01:41):
It's great, but that'd be okay. We're going to do a drinking game from now on and I'll have a shot here. Love White Lotus. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people?

Lauryn Isford (01:01:50):
Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.

Lenny (01:01:58):
What do you look for in an answer when you ask that question? What's your kind of a good sign and what's maybe a bad sign?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:02):
I'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.

Lenny (01:02:19):
Hear, hear. What are five SaaS products that you use day to day, and you can't say Airtable?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:25):
Figma, Miro, Slack, Gmail, and my fifth one, I need to think about it.

Lenny (01:02:36):
It's because I cut out Airtable. I got you.

Lauryn Isford (01:02:39):
I know, I always say Airtable. Airtable's definitely number five.

Lenny (01:02:42):
Okay. Probably number one. Okay, final question. Speaking of Airtable, what's the coolest use of Airtable you've seen?

Lauryn Isford (01:02:48):
There was a great embedded view, which is the internal term for when you put Airtable on your website in an embedded way so people can check out cool stuff, related to finding COVID vaccine when they came out, which was really awesome. I also appreciated that a similar use of Airtable has become quite popular this year in support of facilitating folks who've been laid off to help them find new opportunities.

Lenny (01:03:15):
Lauryn, this was amazing. I learned a ton. We got through everything I was hoping to get through which I did not expect. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and to reach out to you, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?

Lauryn Isford (01:03:28):
You all can find me on Twitter. I'm @laurynisford. I love hearing about how folks with all different kinds of cool products are thinking about growth. In general, I find all of us are better at growing businesses when we study the awesome wins and learnings of others. So, please, my DMs are open. Send me cool things you're working on. I'd love to learn about it.

Lenny (01:03:51):
Amazing. Lauryn, thank you. Let's go drive some growth.

Lauryn Isford (01:03:54):
All right.

Lenny (01:03:57):

# Leveraging growth advisors, mastering SEO, and honing your craft | Luc Levesque (Shopify, Meta)

## Transcript

Luc Levesque (00:00:00):
We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact. Something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack." And then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:00:36):
Welcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

Lenny (00:01:05):
In our conversation, Luc shares advice on how and when to think about getting a growth advisor, including how to structure the relationship and what to look for in an advisor. We also spent a ton of time on SEO, how to think about this as a growth channel, who it's well suited for, and how everything is about to change in SEO with Bard and ChatGPT. Plus Luc shares a ton of really interesting advice around the value of self-reflection, building routines, cold plunges, also a couple of amazing stories about working with Zuck and what you learned from him.

Lenny (00:03:31):
Luc, welcome to the podcast.

Luc Levesque (00:03:34):
Thank you. Good to see you.

Lenny (00:03:36):
It's good to see you too. I want to start with a story that you shared once when we were hanging out in the past and something that I'll never forget, and it's about the time that you just joined Facebook and apparently you had some kind of big presentation you had to give to the entire company or the executive staff. And then I just love the way it kind of unfolded and it kind of gives you a glimpse into what it's like to work with Zuck and at Facebook. Can you share that story if that rings a bell?

Luc Levesque (00:04:00):
If remember the story, well, basically I had just started at Facebook about... I'll use those two interchangeably. I remember it as Facebook and I always will. I was three months in and was working on a new area for me. So I came in, started putting together our thoughts on a strategy and was asked to do a presentation in front of the company with Mark on the strategy. So I whipped up a draft strategy, put together some plots and plans, presented in front of the company and went well. And then every six months there's something called the [inaudible 00:04:32] Team Review of Facebook and basically product area leads will go in and present their strategy, how it's going. Again, I just joined three months before, so I walk in no idea what to expect. I am sitting at a table. You can kind of envision it's a big room, a really big room with a bunch of tables set up in a big square with a little microphone.

Luc Levesque (00:04:50):
So I sit in there, there's Mark and all the executives sitting on the other side. And I sit down and it's quiet for what felt like five minutes. I'm sure it was not, but it was quiet for a while, just sitting there waiting for what's going to happen now. And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, "Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product. It's because they focus exclusively on that magic word, which is impact.

Luc Levesque (00:05:44):
And that was kind of my first introduction to working with Mark and just that laser focus on, "All right, got it. Now when are we going to start seeing impact and kind of moving from there?" So it's something that is very much in the culture there and something that is so important. It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, "I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, "Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months. And yeah, we jumped in and started focusing on having a lot of impact from there.

Lenny (00:06:36):
I love that story. There's a couple things there. One is, if I were in your shoes, I'd poop my pants sitting there for five minutes waiting for what do you guys-

Luc Levesque (00:06:45):
That did not happen. I had a report.

Lenny (00:06:47):
Okay. How did it go? How did you deal with it? Or I guess how did you respond?

Luc Levesque (00:06:51):
Well, we had, funny enough, already started having impact, so I was able to at least respond with, "Hey, we've kind of already started in a few ways" and walk through where we were having impact and just focus on the strategy, what our plans forward were and where we wanted to go from there. So I think that's how I responded.

Lenny (00:07:08):
Okay, great work. So something I've started doing actually on this podcast is I've started to keep a little Post-it of, here it is, of themes that continue to recur across companies that are most successful. And impact comes... It's number one on my Post-it here, is just impact comes up so often as something that the best companies continue to come back to and focus on and put a lot of emphasis on. I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?

Luc Levesque (00:07:42):
Yeah, I mean I think it's easy for a lot of leaders and companies to get caught up in how hard are people working, what did they do, and recognizing and rewarding activity. I mean, everybody wants to have impact. The companies that truly focus on that are the ones that break through and really make a lot of progress towards the mission. So that seems obvious I think when I say it out loud, but being in that culture and having it really ingrained in everything you do whether it's performance reviews or strategies or these reviews with the executive team, it all gravitates around impact. And I think it's that laser focus on it that matters so much. But I mean I've certainly seen it going other ways where it's more about working long hours. And certainly there's a correlation, to be clear, between working hard and impact, but I find it's just such a precise way to think about how people are performing or what you're doing in terms of is your strategy working? Is the direction you're moving in having the intended outcomes that you want? And yeah, I do think it's all about that.

Luc Levesque (00:08:46):
Being a growth leader where everything's so measurable, impact is something that can be very clearly measured and you know whether you have it or not. So the most important thing that we work on constantly is reviewing what's our strategy, what are we working on? Is that driving towards the top level north star outcome we want? Is that having the impact? And then basically doing everything around that singular north star. So it's very, very important. I think it's more profound than it might seem just from the outside. But if you've worked in different companies, you've probably experienced different versions of this too.

Lenny (00:09:20):
Yeah. I want to spend more time on this, but before we move on, you also have another Zuck story. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Zuck recruited you personally to join Facebook/Meta. Is that true? And then if true, what was that like to be recruited by Zuck personally?

Luc Levesque (00:09:35):
It was an interesting experience, very intense, but also one of the reasons for it was I was living in Canada and my family was there and I had some strong personal reasons why I couldn't leave Canada. But yeah, we had a lot of discussions with Mark. I won't get into the micro details of it, that's more Mark's story to tell than mine. But a few takeaways from going through that experience. As a leader, hiring is the most important thing as we all know. It's a craft and a skill that I'm always working on refining. I have my own playbook that I'm constantly tweaking, testing out different approaches, trying to find the best talent and assessing them and trying to close them and bringing them on board. So I learned a lot through that experience with Mark.

Luc Levesque (00:10:15):
A couple things that stood out were the first one would be that Mark really involved the entire executive team. It wasn't just me talking to recruiting or talent or HR or just Mark, it was the entire executive team. That's something that I think a lot of leaders don't take advantage of. I've seen leaders, I've certainly done this at times where you go it alone or you're working with recruiting, but the reality is all the leaders, all the execs in the company know how important it's to bring in talent and they're always more than happy to help. So that's something that I think more leaders should do is really recruit all of their peers and their leaders in the company to help close. And that's certainly something that happened when I was in discussions with Mark and Facebook about joining.

Luc Levesque (00:10:55):
The second one, which I had I suppose never experienced before, was that they made it very personal. I had these reasons why I couldn't leave. So initially I was excited by the opportunity, but I couldn't see myself moving to California for personal reasons. And through discussions, Mark basically involved my wife, involved my spouse in this, Andrea. We flew down, had dinner with him and Priscilla, his wife. Andrea had ended up meeting with many of the executives at Facebook and really talking through what was holding us back, why we couldn't come, potential options and ideas for how we could come down.

Luc Levesque (00:11:33):
But involving somebody's spouse and family I think is a really good idea because it's a very personal decision to change company. It involves more than just that person you're talking to, it involves the whole family. So that was something that I think is an important thing to have in your kind of playbook for hiring, is really think about the whole person's family and involve them if you can. In fact, Toby did this as well at Shopify. He flew down here with Fiona and we had breakfast with Andrea and them and reviewed a few offers when I joined Shopify.

Luc Levesque (00:12:03):
And then the third thing is just to be absolutely relentless and don't give up and don't let momentum drop. It took seven months for me to go from, "This is amazing, exciting, but there's no way I can make this work" to, "Okay, let's move to Palo Alto." And Mark, the execs, a variety of leaders there were in discussions for months and months and months and never letting the momentum die. That's something that I think is really important. No doesn't necessarily mean no, and in this case it definitely wasn't the case. I had the same experience with Toby at Shopify where we've been talking about working together for over 10 years now. And then finally the timing was right and I was able to join the company.

Luc Levesque (00:12:45):
So just be relentless, involve the family, involve the spouse if you can, and recruit some help from other executives in the company. Those were some of the things that stood out through my experience. But yeah, it was a pretty wild time in my life.

Lenny (00:13:00):
Relentless is actually another word. I wasn't necessarily I'm supposed to yet, but I feel like it's another trend to cross. The most impactful and successful founders is just this like, "I will not give up. I will keep at it."

Luc Levesque (00:13:09):
[inaudible 00:13:10].

Lenny (00:13:10):
And so that's a really interesting example of that in action. I was going to talk about this later, but maybe it's a good time to talk about it now, which is around hiring. So you talked about you have this playbook for how to hire. You mentioned to me that you kind of find that as you scale as a leader, hiring ends up being like the most important skill maybe, maybe one of the most important skills. I'd love to hear your take on just what you found about hiring as you've grown as a product leader.

Luc Levesque (00:13:33):
Well, I think you reach a point in your career where you realize that hiring is the skill you now need to become world-class at because you're not no longer doing the work yourself. You're still of course involved and doing some of the work and getting your hands dirty, but the bulk of your team's success now will be the quality of the hires you make and you truly need to be world-class at that. So yeah, I built this playbook out. I was in Canada in Ottawa when I sold that company, Tripadvisor, and really started growing my team and becoming more Leaning into leadership at the time through that experience.

Luc Levesque (00:14:07):
One of the benefits of being in Ottawa and kind of off the grid if you will, is it's a curse and a benefit as that you don't have a ton of people you can learn from. So it does mean you need to go to first principles and think things through from the ground up. It takes a little longer, but you come up with your own playbooks on how to do things. I think you've seen my blueprint, which is a good example of that where I have this blueprint I put together. When new people join the team, I show them my blueprint, which is basically a list of my quirks so we can really quickly align. That's something that just being in Ottawa and trying to figure out how to be a leader and avoid mistakes, I was like, "Wouldn't it be nice if you had a blueprint? When somebody joined, you can just tell them all of your quirks and you can just quickly calibrate on how it is to work together versus through awkward long discussions over the course of a year."

Luc Levesque (00:14:51):
My hiring playbook's a similar thing. I think of it in three different chapters, if you will. There's finding talent, assessing talent, and closing talent. In terms of finding talent, I do believe that the best predictor of future performance is past performance. So I'm looking for what I call signs of excellence. So I want to know the top people generally have done multiple amazing things in their life, repeated success, not just once. Maybe it was work related, maybe not work related. But generally speaking, if you think back to the stars you've worked with, they've done some amazing things. And that's why I always start when I interview or when I chat with people, I started talking about just trying to understand, "What has been your path? What have you done professionally and not professionally?" And generally, stars going to stand out. It's very rare that there's not something obvious that comes through.

Luc Levesque (00:15:39):
So for myself personally, I'm looking for kind of three different signs of excellence to tell me that it doesn't have to be three. The mental model I have is as you're talking to them, you're getting pluses and negatives. There's red flags you're hearing and there's really great things. And then at the end you can make an opinion of how good this person is.

Luc Levesque (00:15:56):
Another great sign of excellence, and this was just through reflecting on stars on the team and thinking what makes them unique, what about them. One of them is when somebody's boss leaves the company and then comes back to poach them, that is such a strong signal because if you think of what just happened, the leader who knows exactly how good this person you're talking to is, they have the most knowledge of the performance of this individual, they left the company. They've come back to poach them, putting their own reputation at risk by coming back depending on the situation. And they would never do that unless this person was really, really good.

Luc Levesque (00:16:37):
So you don't want to over pivot on one signal, you want to look at the full picture. But those are the types of things I look at to bring in top talent. And I've got this whole playbook, mistakes I've made that I've learned from, things to avoid. And over the years, yeah, I've put together this playbook that I try to follow and I'm always running little experiments to try to make it better.

Lenny (00:16:56):
Were going to that blueprint that you mentioned. A lot of which you're talking about is probably more relevant to senior executive type people because you're looking for... Or maybe not because you're looking for say three.

Luc Levesque (00:17:06):
[inaudible 00:17:06].

Lenny (00:17:06):
Okay. So people early in their career could also have three, say, moments of excellence?

Luc Levesque (00:17:12):
Yeah, I mean just thinking off the top, it depends on the type of person you're hiring, but are they a founder? Have they tried to do something? Did they win an award somewhere? Are they a gold medalist at something? Have they done something that others have not that shows grit, that shows drive, that shows the ability to succeed? And I've seen that you can apply that to any candidate you're hiring.

Lenny (00:17:36):
The implication there is, without that, they're probably not going to be stars, that there's a strong correlation between having signs of excellence and them performing really well in this role.

Luc Levesque (00:17:45):
Correct, exactly. Yeah, I mean I suppose it's possible, but it would be pretty rare that somebody would come in without some sign that they stand above the crowd. And again, I'm talking about you generally want to hire the top 1% of candidates. So when you're looking for the best of the best, you definitely are looking for those signals.

Lenny (00:18:01):
Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to bring us back on the agenda that I had for myself, which is I want to start with talking about advisorships and advising and growth advisors. You've been a growth advisor for a long time to some of the most amazing companies out there, Twitter, Pinterest, Patreon, Canva, Thumbtack. I'm sure there's others that you don't list that are more informal. Now you work at Shopify. And so what I think about here is a lot of founders often think about, "Should I bring on an advisor? What should I look for an advisor? I've heard stories of advisors being useless sometimes. People tell me I don't need advisors." So I guess the question here is just what's your take on when it makes sense to bring on and consider bringing on a growth advisor and what should people look for when they're exploring and talking to a potential growth advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:18:47):
A few thoughts. In terms of when, I don't think you can probably come into early. It's probably harder to find really good ones than it is to time it. But generally speaking, I would say you don't want to focus too much on growth until you have product market fit. So make sure you have a product that users love that's either showing strong signs of retention or has some good loop that you can see that you can start thinking about growth.

Lenny (00:19:08):
Let me follow on that thread real quick because I find some founders still want to have someone come help them with growth even though they know they don't have product market fit, even though this tip comes up every single time when I'm talking to growth person, like, "Wait till you have product market fit before doing growth stuff." So could you just add a little bit of why that's important while we're on that topic?

Luc Levesque (00:19:27):
Growth advice is generally always applicable. And if you can start thinking about how to build your product early, even if it's pre-product market fit, you're not going to do any damage, but you may be wasting some capital on an advisor or a growth person too early. The problem that I see is if you start growing a product that doesn't have product market fit, you're actually doing more damage than good because you have a product that is now being exposed to the market through growth levers and through optimization that is giving a bad experience with your product. And you want that product that you know is tight and you know has product market fit to start building the flywheel and start growing. You don't want it to be growing if it doesn't satisfy that need that you're trying to build out for. So I can see it having more damage than good because when somebody tries something, they're unlikely to try it again. And so that's the dangerous game you can get into. So you're better off with a good product that's satisfying a need and then growing from there.

Luc Levesque (00:20:20):
I will say to kind of play devil's advocate with myself and something that I've done actually in one of the products, I've built several consumer products and grown them, is that sometimes to know if you have a product, you need users to use it. So there's like some subtlety in here, but I would say if you are trying to get users in to start playing with it at scale, I mean try to focus in on a market that is maybe off the grid. Like pick some English-speaking country that's a bit off the grid that you can isolate your marketing to so you can start getting dozens or a couple hundred people per day coming in and giving you feedback.

Luc Levesque (00:20:58):
I've seen that work too. So I'd say wait till you have product market fit. If you do start growing your product early because you need that signal from people actually using it beyond just focus groups and friends or small numbers of people, try to do it off the grid in smaller markets that you can get kind of contain the growth and get what you're really trying to get, which is that signal on is it working or not.

Lenny (00:21:19):
Awesome. Okay, I threw us off track. Let's get back on track. So we're talking about when it makes sense to find a growth advisor and then what to look for and so on that you might want to work with.

Luc Levesque (00:21:27):
I mean, what makes a great growth advisor is somebody who really understands what to do but also why certain growth levers work. It's that kind of deep understanding of levers of onboarding or whatever area they're focusing on that really makes growth advisor stand out. So when you're looking for a growth advisor, you want to have those discussions to see like, "How much depth does this person have? Have they seen a playbook and they're just good at repeating the playbook or are they evolving, are they growing?" The best way to get to know that is to start really asking them questions about growth and growth advising and the certain things that they've done and why they think those have worked.

Luc Levesque (00:22:09):
This can be tricky if you don't yourself know growth. So I think one thing that I have not seen a lot of founders do that I would advise is if you have an advisor already... Because this applies to finding growth advisors, but it also applies to hiring good growth talent. So if you have somebody you know whether it's already an advisor or somebody who knows growth, you can solicit their help in trying to flesh out whether somebody you're trying to hire is of high talent. So if you have an advisor, you can make that one of their roles is vet out any new talent coming in. And if you're looking for an advisor, try to find somebody that you know and trust who can do that first pass. Because for somebody who knows growth that you trust, it's actually not a lot of work for them to vet out how talented someone else's. It's an easy ask to make and something that if you have that person in your network or that worked with you that you can leverage for.

Luc Levesque (00:23:01):
But I haven't seen that too often where founders kind of take advantage of people they know or existing growth advisors to help recruit and vet talent because it can be quite hard if you don't know the growth space to know if somebody's good or not.

Lenny (00:23:15):
That's a really interesting idea and it could be where you find someone that's too busy to work with you, but maybe you could just ask, "Hey, could you just easily help me vet people?" And it takes a lot less time.

Luc Levesque (00:23:26):
Yeah, I've never been asked that, which is, I mean I don't know if I'll start getting asked this now, but it does seem like that's a really simple way to add a ton of value. And as a founder, I mean even if you have to pay this person or whatever you have to do, but it's such an important hire to get right. We talk about the 10X engineer and we don't really talk about the 10X growth advisor or 10X growth person, but the same dynamic applies. You could argue it applies even more because the right growth advisor can have literally company changing impact where they're either building or helping to ideate or helping to implement a growth loop that literally changes the company. As we know, you need a great product and you need a great growth loop. And it's usually just one loop that you need to get right. Most companies have gotten to where they are just off of one really strong channel that they've just dominated, so it's important to get right.

Lenny (00:24:17):
Is there an example of that sort of impact that you've seen in your advisorship or other people's of just an impact from one conversation or a little bit of a help?

Luc Levesque (00:24:25):
Definitely. And I think what I would point to is the advantage of a growth advisor is it takes a long time to understand a channel. Certainly people have to know their stuff, they have to be very good at their craft, their growth craft, but also they have to be exposed to a large set of experiments or an environment where they've just seen what works and what doesn't. So no matter how good somebody is, if they haven't been exposed to an environment where there's a lot of experimentation, a lot of learning, it's very hard for them to internalize that. So once a growth advisor has that, it's takes years to learn it, but it literally can take seconds literally to communicate that. So I've worked with some companies that you've mentioned and certainly have had impact very quickly.

Luc Levesque (00:25:09):
I mean, one example would be a company that I worked with. Now, a public company. At the time, they weren't. On day one, walked in, they presented their strategy, their plans, their funnels and their landing pages. I could see very quickly that there was something they were doing that was a little off and I asked them, "Well, why are you doing it that way?" And they said, "Well, we think it just looks better that way." And I said, "Well, just do it this other way." I remember this because it was such a short conversation and then three weeks later we connected and I heard they had rolled it out and it was a large impact that they had from this one change. This has happened many times with the companies I've worked with, but it's a good example that once you know it, it's not hard to recognize it if you deeply understand it to give advice, but it takes a long time to get the base knowledge.

Luc Levesque (00:26:02):
So I don't do these too often anymore, but when I do advise, I take them very seriously. I focus exclusively on having impact. I think that's really important because like you say, there's a lot of advisors out there. Some of them are great, some of them different qualities, and you really want to make sure that if you are an advisor, you want to be in the camp of when this person comes in, they have a lot of impact and it takes time and focus and energy and alignment and there's a bunch of things we can talk about that that helps to drive that alignment. But having impact is the most important thing, whether you're an advisor or if you're hiring because it's one of those weird disciplines where the right person at the right time can literally say a sentence that changes the trajectory of your company. You can't say that for a lot of different disciplines, but this is one of them.

Lenny (00:26:49):
There's that word impact again,

Luc Levesque (00:26:51):
Impact. Impact.

Lenny (00:26:52):
The point you just made about how one conversation can have a ton of impact is a reminder of why sometimes the price of an advisor feels absurd where like, "For one hour it's like thousands of dollars," but it's because obviously they spent a decade learning a thing and one conversation is all of that work they put into it crystallized for you in the moment.

Luc Levesque (00:27:13):
Exactly. It's something I've experienced several times in hindsight when you're like, "Okay, here's the needle in the haystack" and then it's implemented and you can see hundreds of percentages, sometimes over a thousand percent lift when you get it right. It's exhilarating. It's great. I have something I used to say, which is, you want your impact to be so big there's a slide in the next board deck on try to explain what happened. That can happen when you are advising companies because you're able to share a very quickly insights. But one way to drive alignment is not everybody can do this, not all advisors do it this way, but I personally love just when I do these, which is not that frequent, just purely doing equity because I love the alignment in outcomes where the founder will be successful and you will be successful. So the incentives are really good to drive the right performance and the right outcomes that you want as a founder.

Luc Levesque (00:28:09):
So if you can do it, I would definitely advise founders to bring advisors in for equity if you can. I think the same applies for your internal growth team. You want to make sure that the teams are incentivized not on activities, on doing stuff, because there's a lot of stuff to be done in growth, but really driving the outcomes that you want. And equity's just a great way of saying, "Hey, we're in this together. We're on the same side of the table. Let's go grow this company."

Lenny (00:28:36):
I was actually about to ask you what kind of structure you recommend for an advisorship. Is there anything else you can share about just what you'd recommend a founder do in terms of compensation for an advisor?

Luc Levesque (00:28:45):
There's a couple things. I'm a big fan of equity because of the alignment of incentives. You should think about, without getting into too much detail of the actual structure of the deals, but think about how you vest the equity. The last thing you want is an advisor holding back on sharing knowledge. The ideal engagement would be an advisor comes in, delivers as much value as possible quickly, and then trains your team. And then maybe it's a one-year engagement and hopefully they've learned because the advisor has been incentivized to share as much as possible and to train the team as much as possible. And then ideally you don't need them anymore after. So there's something there about structuring equity vesting. I'm a big fan of vesting earlier rather than later. So think about in terms of structure you're vesting, commensurate with the value you want, which is very much front loaded.

Luc Levesque (00:29:35):
I'm also a big fan of three month cliffs. Something I've done, I always do actually, is listen, in the first three months you'll know both sides if it's working or not. And you want to de-risk that on both sides because it really should be seen as a partnership between the advisor and the founder. If the founder thinks you're not adding value in the first few months, I think they should just tear it up and both sides move on. It's not good for the founder to continue the deal and it's not good frankly for the advisor because they're not, for some reason, able to add value in that environment. So I love a three-month cliff at the beginning where if it's not working in the first three months, you tear up the deal and both parties walk away and de-risk the entire thing, and again, drives incentives in the right way where the advisor is 100% incentivized at as much value as fast as possible. And so that's another thing that I tend to do and I've done it for a long time.

Lenny (00:30:28):
That's a really good tip. Basically don't do it for a year if you're vesting for advisors, probably not even to a year, but yeah.

Luc Levesque (00:30:33):
There's a bunch of ways to do it. Honestly, it's hard enough to find growth advisors that have capacity, so you got to also say like, "What can you do that the advisor's comfortable with?" But yeah, I mean just to be candid, I think you want to structure in a way where you're not dependent on the advisor over time. They're adding a ton of value, they're helping teach the team, they're probably bouncing around because your company's changing, your team's changing, your leaders are changing. But over time, and that can be years, but it shouldn't be indefinite. You shouldn't need an advisor forever.

Luc Levesque (00:31:04):
I've seen a scenario where there's desire to keep the advisor on almost as insurance, like, "If something goes wrong, I just wanted to be able to pick up the phone." That can make sense. But I do think a good growth advisor is incentivized to share as much as possible, as fast as possible to have impact to train your team. And then whether you want to keep them on or not long term as an insurance policy or just to answer questions as things change, that should be a choice and not because, "If we lose the advisor. We're completely screwed." That would be a bad place for you to be in as a founder.

Lenny (00:31:35):
You said it's hard to find a good advisor, 100% agree. Any advice for people to help them find an advisor that might be the right fit?

Luc Levesque (00:31:43):
Yeah, I would say there's more of them these days than there were even just five years ago or 10 years ago. Depending on your situation, if you're a founder, I would start with your investors. I think VCs have an amazing network of advisors. I get, I don't know, a couple requests a week that I'm not taking right now. But that from my experience and what I've seen, that's probably especially the high end VCs, the very talented VCs will have this network. And frankly, it's a great partnership as an advisor for you to have. You can help the companies, you can help the VCs and it helps you. So everybody wins, just asking other founders that had good experience, much like hiring.

Luc Levesque (00:32:21):
The third advice I would give is to find companies that are world-class at what you're trying to grow, what channel or skill you're looking at, and then reach out and see if there's a way to help that way. That's actually how I got started. I was at Tripadvisor and a prominent VC reached out. One of the companies they were working with needed some help on SEO. I was still in Canada at the time, got connected with them, had a phone call, had a significant impact through that one phone call. And rather than joining as an advisor, I essentially helped them out pro bono in exchange for, "Hey, I want to get connected in the Valley." So I was in Canada, I wanted to start another company, I wanted to get connected. So through that tactic where they reached out to a company that was known to be world-class at SEO, I think that was really smart on this VC's part.

Luc Levesque (00:33:13):
And then maybe some advice to up and coming growth advisors would be that first one, I didn't take a single shred of equity or money and just tried to have as much impact as possible and to help out this company as much as possible and then make sure that I was able to get connected to other people that I wanted to meet in the Bay Area. And then kind of things snowballed from there.

Lenny (00:33:33):
I definitely want to chat about how to become a growth advisor because I think people listening here might be like, "Oh, that sounds pretty good. Someday maybe I'll become a growth advisor." But before we get to that, what are things that an advisor are best suited for versus finding someone full-time versus no one? What are the ideal kind of problem sets for an advisor versus say, full-time hire person?

Luc Levesque (00:33:57):
I would say your preference should always be to have somebody in-house. I'll start there because you want to have that as part of the culture. There's so much more that they can do when they're in-house. That being said, if you can't find somebody in-house, then bring on an advisor... Even if you bring on an advisor, some advice to founders would be you want to surround your team or at least one person that you've identified who's just a amazing world-class doer, even if they don't know growth, with a set of growth advisors so that they're learning, that's being put through the culture of the company and that knowledge stays inside of the company. So I'd say I would prefer to go internal, surround these people with great advisors and then take it from there. That would be how I approach it.

Lenny (00:34:41):
Okay. So two thoughts here. One is I feel like this podcast is becoming an interesting way to discover awesome growth advisors. I think over time I'm building this directory of who are awesome, smart growth people that are open to advising. So that could be an interesting opportunity to just look through the folks on this podcast and-

Luc Levesque (00:34:59):
Yep, there's some great people that have been on here. Definitely.

Lenny (00:35:02):
Totally working my way through all the amazing least smart growth people and product leaders. The other is I've noticed they're a lot of the best growth advisors have worked with the same sorts of companies. I find Miro comes up a lot, Canva comes up a lot, Pinterest. All these people that have worked with say Pinterest that I hear about are just awesome. Casey comes to mind, Melissa Tan who's coming out with a podcast, I think she worked with them. Dropbox. Anyway, so maybe one idea, see who these companies work with as advisors and that can maybe point you to people that are worth exploring.

Luc Levesque (00:35:34):
I mean, that's a good idea. It kind of goes back to something I mentioned earlier, which is companies that have a lot of traffic and that have a lot of users are a great learning ground for growth people and for advisors, because no matter how smart you are, you need the reps. You got to go to the growth gym and put in the reps, which is experiments. You've got to try things, things that are going to work, things that aren't going to work. There's a discipline of when something doesn't work, you can learn almost as much as when something works. But you need that traffic, you need that environment. And that's why certain companies have these great people coming out like Casey at Pinterest and other people that have been at these companies that have the traffic, have the culture to support it, to support growth. I don't think that's a coincidence why some of these companies have some great people coming from them.

Lenny (00:36:20):
The other tip I just thought about as you were talking is everyone's launching a Substack newsletter that is doing any sort of advising because there's a lot of power in building an audience and creating kind of awareness of what you do. So I wonder if another tip is search Substack's directory of newsletters for specific things you're dealing with, like say, go to PLG or sales and you might find someone there."

Luc Levesque (00:36:39):
I haven't done that, but that seems like a reasonable way to do it.

Lenny (00:36:42):
That's where we're all heading.

Luc Levesque (00:36:44):
I'm not saying that the people on Substack have this. But as advice to the people listening, is when you're vetting for a growth advisor or growth talent, don't just wait it on the public halo of somebody. That's a common mistake I've seen where maybe somebody's done presentations at a conference or somebody's done... I don't know, but their Twitter following is broad. They can be excellent. That's not a disqualifier immediately, but just make sure not to make the hire just exclusively on that. I've made that mistake a few times and it's a common one to get into. So make sure you're vetting properly, even if somebody with a large following on Substack or Twitter. That's I think an important thing to keep in mind.

Lenny (00:37:25):
1000% agree. I always say that the best product leader is the best growth. People don't have time to sit on Twitter and tweet and write newsletters. They're doing the job, working, building, growing, and maybe eventually they get out of that and start writing. But I 1000% agree, there's a lot of people-

Luc Levesque (00:37:40):
Well, not to disqualify all the people on Twitter.

Lenny (00:37:43):
Absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:37:43):
Some of them are tweeting [inaudible 00:37:45], but my point is just don't over pivot on the halo. Just look at their past performance. What teams have they been on? What environment do they have? Do they really know growth? And sometimes they do, but I think it's a common mistake to say, "Oh yeah, they have a large following, let's hire this person." That's poorly.

Lenny (00:38:03):
1000% agree. Rarely does a celebrity hire that seems really genius on Twitter and Substack end up being as amazing as you think.

Luc Levesque (00:38:12):
Yeah, it does happen, but yeah.

Lenny (00:38:13):
It does happen. Absolutely. One last question around this topic. People listening might want to become growth advisors, I'd mentioned this earlier. Is there any other advice you want to share? Just like, "If you want to become a growth advisor someday, here's what you should think about."

Luc Levesque (00:38:26):
Yeah, I think the right mental model as a growth advisor is around the same one as an investor. So the most important thing an advisor can do aside from having impact and knowing their craft is picking which companies to work with, especially if you're working for equity. So I'll only speak to that, but you're basically putting in your time, you're picking likely a smaller number. You only have so many hours in the day of companies to work with and you want to make sure there's a likely exit in the future. So for me personally, I have a spreadsheet, like most big decisions that I make in my life. Over the years I've just added criteria and questions to ask myself about the company and then reflect on, "Okay, is this kind of checking all the boxes for a likely outcome?" Because you don't just need to be successful, you need to be successful and for the company to be successful and for there to be liquidity of that.

Luc Levesque (00:39:17):
So you need to put yourself in the shoes of an investor and look at it as an investment. That is arguably the most important thing because you can go and do a great job and then wait many years and potentially not see any reward for it. And I think that's the nice thing about the equity structure in that you're tied in the same incentives with the founder, which is just great in terms of any relationship to have the same incentives, but you want to make sure that there's a good likelihood of a decent outcome down the road.

Luc Levesque (00:39:49):
If I can throw another one in.

Lenny (00:39:49):
Yeah, absolutely.

Luc Levesque (00:39:50):
The other piece of advice I would give is it can take a long time for some of these companies to be successful. That's okay. You should expect that. In fact, you should just go in with that mindset. When I'm deciding to work with a company, I'm in there for 10 years and I know that and I say that. And I say, "I'm in. We're in this together if I choose to work with the company." But it does mean that the structure of the deal needs to reflect that. So you need to have a long tail at the end.

Luc Levesque (00:40:15):
So if you're taking options or RSUs and it's pure of the equity, make sure you have the time for that to happen. There would be nothing worse than putting your heart and soul having impact and then waiting, I don't know, a couple years and then your equity expires. So you make sure there's a long tail. I mean, it can literally take over 10 years for these companies to exit. And you should be okay with that. I think that's okay. You're taking some risks. They're taking some risk on you and that's a great partnership, but you'll just need the time for that. So advice to growth advisors, make sure to ask for a long tail so that you don't end up in a bad spot in the end. And that incentives, again, are perfectly aligned between the founder and the advisor.

Lenny (00:40:52):
This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is the next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

Lenny (00:41:59):
So I want to segue to a different topic, SEO. You're kind of the... You tell me, but it feels like you're one of the earliest SEO people in tech. You helped grow Tripadvisor many years ago and it was mostly SEO-driven. I think you innovated a lot of SEO tactics and strategies. And then you helped Pinterest, Thumbtack, other companies that are very SEO-driven. You talked about how many companies grow through one channel and these are all very SEO-driven companies. I imagine Shopify has a lot of SEO work that's happening right now with you there. And so I want to chat about SEO. So I guess broadly SEO is like... It's like this amazing growth channel. It's basically free. It continues to work after you stop doing any work on it for a while. Many founders think about, "Should we invest in SEO? How do we approach SEO?" So maybe just as a first question, what are signs that your product and company is a good fit for SEO being potentially a huge channel for growth?

Luc Levesque (00:42:55):
Yeah, I've been doing SEO for a really long time. It's a lot of fun and certainly being a supervisor was a great learning ground for that, that we were able to really innovate and try new things there. In terms of the playbook that we built out. That was a lot of fun, those years.

Luc Levesque (00:43:11):
Couple thoughts. The first one would be I do think there's an SEO play in any company. Maybe at a different extent, but Google is such a large funnel of existing demand for your product or your product area that there's usually an angle to get some SEO traffic there. So I do think it applies to most companies. I would say if you're an early product that the world's never seen, it's a brand new thing, there might be some creation, some demand creation you need to do, but most of the time there's existing demand in Google where you can harvest demand or there's queries that are related to your topic that you can start ranking for to start building brand awareness. So there's always some angle.

Luc Levesque (00:43:52):
And then I kind of divide websites or online products into two categories. There's the ones which are smaller sites, small number of pages, very targeted at your product and don't have this kind of loop of creating new pages automatically. Most eCommerce sites actually have would a number of pages around the products and about us, those types of pages. That's one type of sites. Let's say they have dozen pages. And then there's other ones with thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of pages which are either user generated content like Tripadvisor and Pinterest and others, or marketplaces like Thumbtack and other types of websites like that. Those are generally easier to see a huge amount of impact very quickly because there's such a large optimization surface and ideally it's growing and generating traffic automatically.

Luc Levesque (00:44:40):
I've always thought of LinkedIn as just such a great example of this where you have this viral loop where if you recall when it was just starting, everybody was getting these invites from LinkedIn. Those come and go. You get an invite, you register, you don't. That happens. But the byproduct is when people join, they create this beautiful lightning page, which is your profile that gets indexed. It's kind of like a viral loop feeding an SEO loop that continues to grow. So that's a good example of use generated content which kind of feeds on itself and grows. So there's those two categories. Going back to the first category, if you only have a small handful of pages, the way to think about that is you certainly want to optimize those pages, then you want to start creating content that speaks to your audience beyond that. So you need a content strategy, whether it's a blog or creating new parts of your site that address questions that your audience might have. But generally speaking, I think there's an SEO play in any company and there's just different tactics, strategies, and approaches to get there.

Lenny (00:45:40):
Awesome. I never thought of it that way, that there's kind of these two buckets. So the first bucket is like you don't have a ton of pages that naturally are generated as a part of your experience. And the second is you do. I guess in the second bucket I think of Reddit and Glassdoor and Quora, Tripadvisor, a great example, Pinterest. In the first bucket is the way to generate pages. Basically, it's editorially write content and have people write things for you. Is that generally the strategy?

Luc Levesque (00:46:07):
There's different ways of doing it, but a good content strategy is a kind of tried and true approach. Definitely.

Lenny (00:46:13):
And in that bucket of you don't naturally have a ton of pages, can you primarily grow through SEO? Or is SEO always going to be this minority channel and you have to find something else?

Luc Levesque (00:46:24):
No, it can be a big channel. This is also about creating content, but it's not your users creating the content. You have to go create the content and have some high quality answer to a question that's being asked on Google. I think one thing to keep in mind with SEO is entire industries are based off of single keywords. I remember when I was in the travel industry that literally companies were bought and sold based on one keyword rank. So it's not like, "Oh, it's a little bit of traffic." And I think this is a bit unintuitive with growth. A lot of people, they'll think of growth as linear or it's another channel, it's another thing. I mean, growth done right is exponential. It literally is company changing.

Luc Levesque (00:47:00):
When you're talking specifically about SEO, keep in mind the world is searching for that thing, targeted on that one keyword and likely you're clicking the number one search result. So getting that number one spot is not like, "Oh, that's a little bit of traffic." You can literally build an entire business around that first spot. So don't think that's... Well, maybe it is commonly known, I'm not sure, but it's definitely something that is non-obvious or intuitive I think to most people. And if you have an entire SEO team working on one keyword, I don't think that's crazy because a small number of keywords can define an entire industry or a business.

Lenny (00:47:37):
Is there an example of that sort of situation when keyword's building a massive company?

Luc Levesque (00:47:41):
Yeah, I mean there's a lot I'm sure. I can speak to my own company that I sold to Tripadvisor. It was called TravelPod. It was a travel blogging website where you can think WordPress, but for travel, which I started earlier. It was the first site to do that. I made the mistake of not knowing SEO or growth before I sold the company. And so that was a great learning for me. When I went in, this is a story where we're looking to acquire another site and I thought the product was pretty poor. I remember talking to the founder and thinking... He'd asked me if we'd want to acquire it, and, "The product's terrible. Why would I want to acquire that?" He's like, "Yeah, they're 10 times bigger than you." And, "What?" That was when I realized, "Okay, we've been building a great product and great engineering culture and it is important, but you really need to know this growth stuff." So that's actually the moment I shifted to, "All right, we have to really know these growth levers."

Luc Levesque (00:48:34):
In that space, the number one keyword was Travel Blog. And so owning that was a big deal and we did not own it. I think we ranked number two for a really long time. I can't remember if we got it in the end, but that's just one example where... And there was many, many travel businesses where I always loved looking at a business and trying to figure out, "What's their growth loop? How did they do that?" And it's not like, "Oh, it's a great business. It just grew." Most of the time it's price line crushed it at SEM. Facebook crushed it at a viral loop where you got tagged in a photo, you got an email and you had to go register because there's a photo of you somewhere you really want to see. Tripadvisor did a great job at SEO. In [inaudible 00:49:14], it's just one really strong channel that propelled the company forward. And in this case, it can literally come down to one keyword like we had at TravelPod.

Lenny (00:49:20):
So maybe it's a good time just to give a people a mental model of the different channels/loops that exist. So you've talked about SEO is one, paid search is one. What's the collection for people to think about? Usually as you said, one of the use is the primary source of growth for a company.

Luc Levesque (00:49:38):
Yeah, there's a variety of them. I think you have to look at where the intent is right now. It does change over time, but you have social channels like TikTok, Instagram. Influencers are a great area to engage with there. You have SEO, you have search. I think ChatGPT is another upcoming one that we might want to talk about a little bit where I do think we've never seen that kind of growth for search before and that's a platform that we have to start thinking about how do we optimize for it. Google just announced there are recent changes. They're going to be putting in an AI box at the top, the searchers also, how do you optimize in a world where it's not so much about optimizing for the platform, but teaching the AI what you do and why you're the best in the world at it. So that's another whole area that we could talk about, but that's a big channel I think that that's growing.

Luc Levesque (00:50:29):
Viral loops are always a powerful thing if you can get them to work. That's more about psychology and channel optimization, where you want people to be incentivized to share the product that you have with their friends and then to have their friends come back and register. So you can have one viral loop, you can have secondary viral loops, you can bolt viral loops on your existing products. There's different ways of doing this. And then just backing up. When I think about growth, I don't think about a specific... It's not growth equals SEO and Instagram. For me, growth equals whatever it takes to move the needle. So I get this question all the time, "How do you build a growth team? What does a growth team do?" And I say whatever it takes. That could be zero to one building a new product. It could be M&A, it could be SEO, it could be social, it could be onboarding.

Luc Levesque (00:51:15):
I think that's a better framework to look at. And then if you look at it through that lens, then partnerships easily folds into that where I've seen a lot of businesses get very big on just really clever partnerships, either strategic or broad kind of affiliate based partnerships. So there's a lot of channels. I definitely wouldn't restrict the scope of a growth team to just a small subset, but have a very wide funnel or at least strategy in terms of just test a lot of different things and go after the channels that work and pivot when it does, and then really lean into the one or two or three that really work because sometimes that's all it takes for business.

Lenny (00:51:50):
Well, you definitely nerd sniped me with the ChatGPT, so let's just spend some time there. I think this relates to just the general sense that SEO is always changing and it feels like this is an SEM I guess in this case too. And ChatGPT and Bard, I guess, is maybe the latest change. So what should we know there?

Luc Levesque (00:52:05):
Yeah, I think we're all still trying to figure it out. I was at Google IO last week or the week before. As soon as I saw the search result with the big box of AI, answers at the top, having done this for so long, I immediately knew the impact that I think is about to come. I've seen this play out in travel where Google acquired ITA and did flight search and hotel search. Generally, it's great for users and great for Google and the search engines, but makes it a little bit difficult for the publishers and the sites that are adding value to the ecosystem through being ranked in search results.

Luc Levesque (00:52:42):
So what we're about to see is basically Google, what they showed was a big box on top of the search results that answers the query directly. So if you think about that, that means that there's a lot of queries right now that users are clicking through down on the organic links and getting their answer there, which will be answered directly in the search result. We've seen this play out over the last five to 10 years where more and more answers are being shown at the top. Every time something changes, entire industries are disrupted or are changed. And I think that's going to happen again.

Luc Levesque (00:53:14):
So there's different types of keywords. There's transactional ones like e-commerce keywords with purchase intent. There's navigational ones where you're trying to get somewhere. And there's informational keywords, which is, "I have a question. I'm looking for an answer." It's pretty broad. It's a big area. I think that last category of keywords is particularly at risk. So if anybody listening to this is currently getting traffic on those, you should start thinking about what does that mean when things start changing. And I think the changes will be... We'll probably start seeing things shift to paid. You have to pay for that free traffic.

Luc Levesque (00:53:47):
The second one is there may just be a case where those keywords just don't get many clicks anymore. You might drop down to a very small number of clicks, if at all, because questions will get answered directly in the search results. So it's a big shift. We have to see how things land, but that's, I think over the next 12 to 24 months, if history repeats itself, we'll see that channel change. We've seen this play out in all the different channels. They kind of evolve generally. You can't blame the companies are doing what they have to do. ChatGPT is now 50% of my daily searches and not Google. So I think Google has to react and this is what we'll see. So from a growth perspective, definitely something to start to think about.

Lenny (00:54:25):
Super fascinating. I think about my newsletter and now Google suck it all up and just tell you all the answers. Great. Good news for me.

Luc Levesque (00:54:33):
[inaudible 00:54:34].

Lenny (00:54:39):
Yeah. Yeah. And change is great. Things don't-

Luc Levesque (00:54:41):
It's exciting. It's exciting. I'm just geeking out on growth a little bit, we haven't had a big platform change in a long time. So I'm like, "All right, cool. Let's go see what we can do here. How do you optimize this? How do you get listed if you can?" We're not sure where the placements will be, but that will be the new game.

Lenny (00:54:58):
Yeah, there's actually a lennybot.com that is a GPT bot trained on my content that there's a newsletter post about how it was all built so you could build your own. And so I think my new goal is going to have to convince people to go to lennybot.com instead of Google. Wish me luck.

Luc Levesque (00:55:15):
Hey, you got to lean into it. Yeah, we have a shop.ai, this great AI-based shopping engine. And I'll tell you, I bought so much on it. It's so good. The more you use these technologies, the more you realize how good they are. And that's something biggest coming. It's not just, "Oh yeah, there's another change." I was summarizing the Google change is to some people and originally was thinking this is the biggest change in the last 10 years. And then when I reflected on the last 10 years, I thought this is actually the biggest change since the inception of Google actually. I don't think we've seen something as profound as what's coming. And you really need to get ready for it.

Lenny (00:55:52):
Yeah, I've been using ChatGPT for helping me with interview questions actually, and once in a while there's like a really good one.

Luc Levesque (00:55:59):
Oh, that's cool.

Lenny (00:56:00):
So thank you ChatGPT, bringing me good things also. Maybe one more question along these lines around kind of connecting advisorship in SEO. Would you suggest when you're starting to think about SEO, starting to invest in SEO, you might be listening to this feeling like, "I got to think about SEO," does it make sense to bring on, say, SEO advisor like you? I know you're not available currently, but other folks like you or are an agency that is really good at this stuff or bring on someone full time? Do you have any kind of frameworks for thinking about which direction to go?

Luc Levesque (00:56:30):
It's hard for an agency or a pure advisor without internal help to do a really good job without internal talent at the center. So I would say I would start with just hire somebody internally and give them the mandate and incentivize them correctly to go and own this channel. Even if they don't know SEO, my advice would be get an engineer, get somebody who is just a relentless doer who wants to learn this and surround them with great advisors that I've just seen that work really well.

Luc Levesque (00:56:59):
There are some good agencies out there. Agencies will be working with multiple companies, so it's a little bit harder to get the same impact from an agency. It can work sometimes. But my preference is generally a last resort would be an agency. And I'd much rather have somebody who's internal who knows the business, who knows the keywords, who can have the knowledge internally inside the company permanently and help grow a team around them and have succession in place and a proper team so that you're not too dependent on this one person. But that would be my go-to. And then if you're really stuck, you can use agencies, but my default would be having somebody internal supplemented with agencies if you have to. Sorry, SEO is very specific. I mean, it's a very tight channel that knowing certain things about it can have a big impact. I think you do want people that have that experience that can bring that in from the outside to augmenting internal teams. It'll take a really long time to learn it.

Lenny (00:58:01):
Awesome. I was going to ask that. So you ideally want to find someone that's done it before that isn't just a relentless learner, but is that plus, has done SEO in the past?

Luc Levesque (00:58:08):
Oh, yeah. Ideally, you hire an amazing SEO person who can bring internal. Second would be somebody amazing who can get things done, surround them with advisors. And then in my stack rank, the third would be agencies.

Lenny (00:58:20):
Awesome. And then the other kind of common issue with SEOs, it takes a long time to show impact. Do you have just a rule of thumb of just give them this much time to see if they can make an impact?

Luc Levesque (00:58:29):
I'd say a few things. I'd say if you already have content and pages that are pretty good and getting a decent amount of traffic, it doesn't necessarily have to take a long time. So that would be my first reaction. It can take a long time. Generally, it takes a long time when you have to build new content. So the way to think about Google is it is going to take your content, it's going to show it to its users, people that are searching, and it's going to determine which piece of content is the best to ranked highly. It's not just about little tricks and links and keyword ratios. Those days are over. Those do matter, but it's not purely about that. And if you have a new piece of content, it takes time for Google to build enough trust to say, "Okay, I'm going to start showing this to users now" and then start collecting user feedback and then rank it appropriately. That can take some time.

Luc Levesque (00:59:14):
But if you have existing pages that are ranking eight and they're already on the first page, it doesn't always happen. But I've certainly seen it, in fact more common than not that you could have sometimes hundreds of percentages of lift very quickly. And it depends what you're starting with, is probably the right way to think about it. So if I'm trying to summarize it, I would say 12 months is probably max. If you can't see impact in 12 months, there's something wrong. If you have existing content, it could happen pretty early. It could happen on day one. Actually I've seen that happen. If you have to build new parts of the site, it can take months. I've seen that happen in companies I've worked with where I think it would be like a quarter, we had to wait till we saw a big lift. So it's somewhere between three to 12 months.

Lenny (01:00:05):
Awesome. That's really helpful. Okay, so final topic/final question. You've had a truly incredible career. You've worked with incredible companies, incredible leaders. I'm looking at your site here in a site window and you're like, here's a picture of you and Zuck. Here's a picture of you and Toby from Shopify, and there's more. I'm curious what you believe has been key to your success and your career success that you suggest listeners who want to have some measure of similar success do.

Luc Levesque (01:00:36):
It's probably a bunch of things we could talk about here. Yeah, this is the obvious thing is I think you've just got to love what you do. You got to work hard. You have to have impact. Certainly at the end of the day in growth, that's all that will matter. If I think back to specific things that I do though to pick one thing that's been very important for me throughout my journey is the art of self-reflection. And coaches. I've had coaches my whole career. But the macro theme is you're constantly iterating, experimenting, and becoming the best you can be in your career also as a dad and as a husband, and of course for your own personal health. But that reflection is so important. I've leveraged many, many different coaches over the years and now do a lot of self-reflection through a morning routine that I have and that I've been doing for quite some time that has been a big unlock for me.

Luc Levesque (01:01:32):
The biggest, most important part of that morning routine is dedicating an hour aside to really think about, "What's going well? What's not going well? What am I screwing up? Well, why am I screwing it up?" Which is often more important than, "What am I screwing up?" And of course, "What am I going to do about it?" But as long as you're learning and iterating every day, then you're just making constant progress towards your goals. It's something I do that I love doing. I love thinking. So I literally can just sit there and think for hours actually. I have a dashboard on all the areas that I'm focusing on with red, yellow, green, and just constantly revving on what am I working on improving, what am I doing, what experiments am I running and where am I doing well and where am I not doing well and how can I be better in all areas of my life, including being a leader. There's a lot of different things to it, but I think that's really important and something that I've learned over the years that is probably the most valuable to have as a skill.

Lenny (01:02:32):
I definitely want to spend more time on this. So you said you sit for an hour reflecting on what's going well, what's not going well. Is there more you can share about how you accomplish that, how you find time to do this for an hour?

Luc Levesque (01:02:43):
Yeah, it sounds crazy when you say it, but I do. So I wake up at 5:00. I work out. So I do cardio, I do some exercise. There's this great book called Spark, which is all around the neuroscience of exercise and I really learned a lot from that in terms of having this great morning routine that really boots you up. I kind of call it my bootloader. When I start in the day, if I go through my bootloader, I have just a much better day.

Luc Levesque (01:03:09):
So exercise, stretching, meditation, and then I do a cold plunge now. So I do a bunch of different things. But then I do some reading, but I do carve aside one hour where I go through... And this is probably important and it's where I've landed, but structured self reflections. That's why I have this dashboard. I have certain areas that I think about what's going well, what's not. I track all the experiments I'm writing. I'm just really passionate about if you're going to do something, try to do it as best as you can. This is a habit that has allowed me to sharpen my skills in certain areas.

Lenny (01:03:47):
What are some of these things you're working on? If you can share what's on this dashboard, how can people imagine what this might be?

Luc Levesque (01:03:53):
So there's a lot of personal stuff on it, but it literally is broken down between being a better friend, better husband, better dad, and then better leader. And so on the personal side, I've been known to work a lot of times. Balance is always hard to find. From being a dad and then thinking about how to be better there, I realized about six months ago that I've never actually asked for feedback on how I'm doing. So I asked my kids six months ago, I asked both of them independently, "What's one thing I can do to do more of or do less of to be a better dad?" And they were kind of caught off guard by it. My son's 15 and my other son is 12. And I said, "Take some time to think about it." And after about a month, my son came back and said, "Dad, I got one." He said, "I want to spend more time with you."

Luc Levesque (01:04:53):
So that was very helpful for me to hear. I'm big on routines and habits to make sure that things that you want to do are repeatable and it's not one-off things. So ever since that day, I've now have a daddy date if you want to call it. But every two weeks we do one-on-one time together with each of the boys. They get to pick what we do just so we have that consistent, whether it's dinner or play basketball in the front. But it's all about feedback. So that's one example on the personal side.

Lenny (01:05:27):
This reminds me of a tweet I just saw where someone said that the only people that are going to remember that you worked late for many nights is your kids.

Luc Levesque (01:05:37):
Wow. Wow. That's deep. I like that a lot.

Lenny (01:05:43):
As a soon to be parent, that's going to stick with me.

Luc Levesque (01:05:46):
Wow, I like that a lot. So it's tough, right? It's tough to balance it all out. It's very difficult because you want excel at everything you do in life. So that reflection helps, be it check-in as well of how am I doing in all these areas? And that I find the color coding is helpful for that too, of just doing a bit of a gut check and asking for that feedback.

Lenny (01:06:06):
So it also makes me think about, I was watching a Jeff Bezos interview and ask him what his morning routine was and he said that he just likes to putter around. he likes to just sit around, talk to his kids, read the newspaper. He doesn't book any meetings in the morning. He just finds he just needs a little flex time at the beginning.

Luc Levesque (01:06:22):
Totally. Before I became a dad, I read somewhere that one of the most impactful things you can do as a father is just be there for dinner every night. So I have been there for 15 years every single night. But it was a good reminder it's not enough. Having dinner is important with your family, but in our case there's more you can do. And just getting that feedback and doing some reprioritization is always important.

Lenny (01:06:46):
Speaking of dinners, and maybe just as a last question, I know you do this really interesting thing where you have dinners with interesting people. You just kind of invite them to your house. I don't know if interesting is the right way to describe it, but just kind of interesting people, prominent people. Can you just talk about what that is and what you think about and the benefits of doing something like that?

Luc Levesque (01:07:04):
I think interesting is the right way to think about it.

Lenny (01:07:05):
Okay.

Luc Levesque (01:07:07):
I started this when I was in Ottawa with a bunch of founders there. It's become one of my favorite things to do. Honestly, it's like the bright spot in my month that, I call them guilds. So the word guild is with the builders. That's how it originally started. So Guild Night is what I call it. The idea is basically all interesting people doing interesting things actually want to spend time with each other. That's why I'm actually surprised more people don't do this. But I'll basically have interesting people come, usually five or six. We'll sit around talking about specific topics. So I do one for consumer product, I do one for SEO, I do one for growth leaders and just have really smart, interesting people come and we'll talk about different topics that are relevant.

Luc Levesque (01:07:57):
Sometimes we'll pick a topic, so we'll have a group and then we'll say, "Hey, we want to talk about AI." So one of the advantages of being in the Bay Area is you can find three or four people that likely wrote some of the core code in Google or in AI, and then they'll join. People want to meet. People want to get together and have these conversations. So it's very exhilarating. I learn a ton. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why more people don't do it. And it's a bit of work to organize, but it's also just tactically been a great way to meet fascinating people. It's helped a lot for recruiting, for if you need a back channel. Now you know all these people that are in different industries. But business aside, they're very valuable business wise, but they're just a lot of fun and they've become some of my favorite things that I do.

Luc Levesque (01:08:43):
I'm really surprised why more people don't do it because I think especially now that everybody's remote and we're working from home, or most people are, it's more valued than ever. So it's something I'm looking forward to continuing and always actually through my morning reflection, thinking about what are new ones I can spin up who are interesting people that we want to break bread with. I do think it's important that it's done at your house. If anybody's thinking of starting this, you can do it at a restaurant, but there's something about being in your home or being in somebody's home, five or six people having a great conversation about a topic that's mutually interesting. I think everybody values it and it adds a lot of spice to life. I think it's really important.

Lenny (01:09:23):
Any other tactical tips for making one of these happen? So you do it at your home, you cater. How many people? How long? Anything else you want to share there?

Luc Levesque (01:09:31):
Yeah, so I think the most I've done is 10. That's a bit too much. Six seems to be perfect, six to eight, eight at the max. I do get a catered so you don't have to worry about cooking. The topic, something like a topic that it's common so that everybody can rally around. I do think it's important, like I mentioned, doing it at home. Usually we start around 6:00, we go till 9:00 or 10. It's just been a really good thing that I've learned over time is a really good thing to do to just make for a better life, frankly. Make richer life with some great friends.

Lenny (01:10:08):
And when we say cater, it's just ordering in basically, right? It's not that-

Luc Levesque (01:10:11):
Yeah, you can just DoorDash some food so you don't have to worry about cooking. I'm sure there's other things. I've never really deeply thought about it, but in terms of what are the specific things, I've evolved it over time, but I don't cook anyways, so it would be terrible if I cooked. So this is much easier to do it this way. And as long as you're inviting kind of interesting people, everybody's going to want to come and spend some time and bring some bread.

Lenny (01:10:33):
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?

Luc Levesque (01:10:39):
I think so.

Lenny (01:10:40):
I think you are. Well, question one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?

Luc Levesque (01:10:47):
So there's one that I've already mentioned, which is Spark. It's the neuroscience of exercise. That's a great book. It's not one of these exercise to stay fit and to live longer. This is really about, frankly, if you exercise and do it in a specific way, they have a kind of blueprint they lay out, it's good for just cognition and kind of horsepower and performance. So that's been a really important one and has been a big part of me building on my morning routine. The second one is when I picked up I think about a year ago or six months, and I recommended it, gee, I don't know, at least to a couple hundred people now because I recommended it to my team. It's called Smart Brevity. Have you heard of this one?

Lenny (01:11:31):
No, but I love the sound of it.

Luc Levesque (01:11:33):
I've always been big on writing crisply and being very tight and not having three-page memos that you're sending off. Especially now that we're remote and we're all doing slack and email and different ways of messaging, how tightly you communicate, how crisp your communication is really important for frankly you getting your point across and also for the other person who's probably digesting a hundred of these messages. So this book is... It's a book on how to do that. It breaks down how to write crisply and the different parts of it. I've definitely seen improvements in the team since I've passed around. So that's a great book frankly for anybody, work or personal because we're writing so much and communication is so key. So that's the second one. The third one is a golden oldie. It's one that I've read many, many times and I recommend from a growth perspective. This one youlikely heard of, it's Influence by Cialdini.

Lenny (01:12:28):
I got it back on my bookshelf there.

Luc Levesque (01:12:30):
Yeah, it's a great book, and it's because it's really the underpinning of so many different product and growth principles that you can apply. So that's just a classic that is good to reread at least once a year. So those are three books.

Lenny (01:12:42):
I'm going to extend this a little bit. I'm going to add two books that are building on your two books, or the first two books, I guess. One is Peter Attia just wrote a book called Outlive. That is-

Luc Levesque (01:12:50):
I've got to read it.

Lenny (01:12:51):
Okay. And it's exactly the same kind of premise of just how important exercise is. I think there's a quote in there of just the only thing proven to help you live longer is exercise. And then Smart Brevity, there's another book that I'd recommend if people want more on though on this topic called Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Luc Levesque (01:13:07):
[inaudible 01:13:08].

Lenny (01:13:08):
And it's by the guy that wrote the War of Art and Bagger Vance. I forget his name off the top of my head, but it's like, "Nobody wants to read your shit. Here's what you need to do for people to want to read anything you're writing."

Luc Levesque (01:13:23):
Yeah. We want to scan. We want to read. Yeah, that's great. I'll pick that one up. Nobody Wants to Read Your Shit.

Lenny (01:13:27):
Exactly. What a title.

Luc Levesque (01:13:29):
That's a great title.

Lenny (01:13:31):
All right, back on track. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?

Luc Levesque (01:13:36):
I don't watch TV much and I haven't really watched any movies in a while. But I do watch a lot of podcasts on YouTube. Andrew Huberman has got, of course, a great series. I've watched I think everyone he puts out, so I don't know if that counts, but that's-

Lenny (01:13:49):
Absolutely

Luc Levesque (01:13:50):
Okay. So I watched that. And then of course the All-In Podcast is always fun, so I make sure to watch those when they come out as well. A lot of fun and informative. So those are my two, I would say.

Lenny (01:14:01):
Great picks. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?

Luc Levesque (01:14:06):
Teach me something about growth that I don't already know. Because... and you could apply this to engineering product, any other area, because it really gives you a sense of what this person thinks is the top of the stack in terms of the smartest thing they know. Whether you know it or not is irrelevant. But sometimes you actually do end up learning some stuff. But it's my favorite question because you can really engage in a conversation around, "Okay, the thing you think is so unique that maybe you've come up with this learning yourself or you've created this tactic and then it gives you a sense of how much they know the craft." So that's my favorite question.

Lenny (01:14:42):
What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love?

Luc Levesque (01:14:46):
I've got a cold plunge that I bought that I love. So it's called the Renew Cold Plunge. It's cold but super convenient and I do that every morning and I just love it.

Lenny (01:14:58):
Any advice for cold plunging? That sounds very painful and hard.

Luc Levesque (01:15:01):
I usually start going... I go in a hot tub to warm up, then I go in the cold plunges and back in the hot tub. That's an easy way to get started. But I will say I jumped in yesterday and today without going to hot tub. It was very painful, but I felt so much better after. So I might be changing up my approach, but I'm just kind of experimenting with different things. But that would be some advice. And then just go slow. Start it not too cold, and then slowly make it cold over time. But I think it's a pretty good thing to add in so far.

Lenny (01:15:31):
How long have you spent in the cold plunge?

Luc Levesque (01:15:33):
It varies. Right now I'm doing five minutes. Five minutes at, I think it's 53 degrees. So I've started at 60, slowly bringing it down. But you do have to go slow because I brought it down even further and kind of caught me off guard and got a little dizzy. So you got to find your sweet spot.

Lenny (01:15:53):
Damn. Very Huberman inspired. I imagine this-

Luc Levesque (01:15:57):
Definitely it was part of the source there.

Lenny (01:15:59):
I know people would hear a lot about cold plunges. I guess what have you seen as a benefit just while we're on this topic for people to seriously consider doing this?

Luc Levesque (01:16:06):
So a couple things. Mood afterwards is so much better. You get this great multi-hour boost from doing it. Especially like I mentioned, not doing warm before or waiting 10 minutes and waiting 10 minutes after before you warm up, after you get out, great mood boost. It also helps a lot with sleep. So if you do it at night, which is a little bit difficult, it helps a lot with sleep. Those are probably the two biggest things. And you do get to a point, I'm there now where I kind of look forward to it because you know how good you'll feel afterwards. So when I'm thinking about it, I know it's painful, it doesn't make it easier, but I do look forward to it now. It's a pretty cool thing.

Lenny (01:16:44):
Oh man. I got to get one now.

Luc Levesque (01:16:46):
Yeah. [inaudible 01:16:49].

Lenny (01:16:49):
Okay, two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?

Luc Levesque (01:16:56):
One change that comes to mind is it's common to hear discussion around you need to experiment, you need to have rigor, you need to look at results, iterate based on those results. That's pretty much common knowledge is how all good companies that execute growth that do it. I think the subtlety is that experiments are great, but they can be slow. You have to look at the results. You have to analyze how things went. You have to learn what's going on. You have to build the experiment. So there's a cost to an experiment and not everything needs to be experimented. And that's not something that I generally hear growth teams talk about. It's usually, "Hey, we need to experiment."

Luc Levesque (01:17:40):
So one thing that we're definitely focused more on lately is this idea of sometimes you just need to YOLO it because it's a better product experience or you just kind of know it's going to work. And if you're YOLO-ing 40 things and three of them work and you can look at pre-post, you can look at holdouts, there's ways of making sure you don't cause major damage, but the speed can outweigh the cost and time it takes to do experiment. So that's one change we've recently implemented. That's been pretty impactful.

Lenny (01:18:09):
Final question. So we met actually a long time ago in Montreal, or maybe it was in Ottawa, in Canada somewhere. I think it was through an organization called C100 when I was starting my company back in the day. And so my question is, what is your favorite Canadian food?

Luc Levesque (01:18:24):
It's funny. My favorite Canadian food, I'm from Ottawa and there's a lot of shawarma, Lebanese shawarma everywhere. I know it's not traditionally Canadian, but Canada's so multicultural, so I'll make this count. I love a good shawarma and it's so hard to find a good shawarma in the Bay Area. We've still been looking here. But my favorite Canadian food or pseudo Canadian is shawarma. If I had to pick one purely Canadian food, and this is related to Montreal where we first met, it's got to be a Montreal smoked meat sandwich.

Lenny (01:18:58):
Excellent choices. You're making me very hungry. I'm going to go get some shawarma, buy me a cold plunge. Luc, this was amazing. We talked through everything I was hoping to talk through. Advisorships, SEO, hiring, building habits, cold plunges. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Luc Levesque (01:19:18):
You can find me online at luclevesque.com. So first name, last name.com. And how can they be useful to me? Listen, we're always looking to hire the best of the best. So if you want to work at an amazing company with an amazing team doing very impactful work and learn the craft of growth, please reach out. We're always looking to bring on amazing talent. So that would be the woodway.

Lenny (01:19:40):
Awesome. Luc, thank you again so much for being here.

Luc Levesque (01:19:43):
Thanks. It's great to chat.

Lenny (01:19:45):

# Pricing your AI product: Lessons from 400+ companies and 50 unicorns | Madhavan Ramanujam

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

(00:01:36):
Bill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.

(00:02:05):
If you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.

(00:02:19):
And some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies. If you want to work with them, check him out at 49palmsvc.com.

(00:04:34):
Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

## Transcript

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:00):
The good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:07):
It feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:11):
The winners in AI will need to master monetization from day one. If you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you start at training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, you're in trouble. 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that that 20% is the easiest thing to build often.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):
What would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:33):
If you think about market share and wallet share, let's think about it as a two-by-two. The quadrant that you really want to be in is the outcome-based pricing model, the top-right quadrant where you have great autonomy and great attribution. About 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model. If you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:00:58):
Some of them, yes, without naming names.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):
Today my guest is Madhavan Ramanujam. Madhavan is the smartest person I know on pricing and monetization strategy. As managing partner at Simon-Kucher, he's worked with over 250 companies, including 30 unicorns, to help them figure out how to price, package, and grow their products.

(00:01:18):
He's also the author of the book on pricing called Monetizing Innovation. And now he's back with a new book, a sequel, called Scaling Innovation, which teaches you how to architect your business for long-term profitable growth and also how to avoid the common traps that teams fall into that keep them from building real, durable, sustainable businesses.

(00:01:36):
Bill Gurley wrote the foreword. I had a chance to read an early copy. I absolutely loved it. It's a book that every founder needs to read. And in this episode, Madhavan shares many of the biggest lessons from the book, including how pricing strategy is very different for AI companies, why you need to get your pricing model right from the start in today's market, a very simple two-by-two to help you pick your pricing model, how to gain pricing power, a ton of tactical advice for negotiating more effectively, the most common traps founders fall into, and so much more.

(00:02:05):
If you order five copies of the book, Madhavan is offering a chance to win a free conversation with him, a signed copy of the book, an invite to the book launch, a t-shirt, and more. Just send a copy of your purchase receipt to promo@49palmsvc.com.

(00:02:19):
And some more good news, Madhavan is now more accessible. He left Simon-Kucher. He's now investing full-time with his own fund. He focuses on early-stage AI companies. If you want to work with them, check him out at 49palmsvc.com.

(00:04:34):
Madhavan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:37):
It's exciting to be back, Lenny. Thanks so much for hosting me again.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):
This is a very rare second visit to the podcast. You've got a new book coming out. I've got a very early copy right here. If you're watching on YouTube, here's the copy you sent me. It's like 200 pages. Did you print this out on your printer, by the way?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:04:54):
Yes, I think I ran out of printer ink after that, I guess.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):
I appreciate the early copy. It's amazing. What we're going to be doing with this conversation is going through some of the biggest lessons that you shared in this book to give people a sense of many of the things that you share, many things you've learned since writing the first book.

(00:05:11):
Let me start with this question. Why'd you decide to write another book? And what is the difference between Scaling Innovation, which is the name of this book, and Monetizing Innovation, is the name of the first book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:05:21):
So Monetizing Innovation, we actually wrote it eight years ago. Time Flies. And the core thesis of that book was, how do you build products that are not just cool but are products that people need, value, and are actually willing to pay for? And I think that took a life of its own.

(00:05:36):
And over the years, we kept getting another question from entrepreneurs that, "Hey, we built a great product, we know there is willingness to pay, but how do we build a great business? How do we scale this?" And the brutal truth is that even if you have a great product, you might actually not figure out a way to grow fast and grow profitably. So we wrote Scaling Innovation in an effort to actually solve that puzzle.

(00:05:55):
So you can think of this as a sequel to Monetizing Innovation. And Monetizing Innovation. Talked about how to build great products. Scaling Innovation talks about how to build a great business. And writing a book is... There needs to be a purpose for this. For me, the reason for writing books is about giving a bit back based on what I know to founders. And book writing is hard. Writing a good book is even harder.

(00:06:19):
And just like Monetizing Innovation, Scaling Innovation is not marketing fluff. It actually has real actionable stuff packed in that you can go on Monday morning and start implementing. And we wrote this book to give back a bit of what we know and to help companies scale and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):
I love people like you that do the work for, I don't know, decades at this point, learn from real life experiences over and over and over, and then just share all this stuff with people. This is the most... the highest ROI way to learn, is letting you do all this work to learn all these things and then you share all your answers with us. So that's why I love these books.

(00:07:00):
If you had to boil down the thesis of this book into just a simple thought so that we can just start to plant this in founders's heads, what would that be?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:07:08):
So if I have to boil down the core thesis of the book, it is basically that if you want to build an enduring business, you need to be able to architect towards profitable growth. What that means is you need to be able to master two engines: market share and wallet share.

(00:07:26):
It sounds simple on the surface, but it's actually quite complex. Because if you unpack that, for gaining market share and wallet share, you need to be good at acquisition, monetization, and retention, as in get customers, make an initial money on them, but also make money on an ongoing basis and have your customers actually refer more customers.

(00:07:46):
Many companies, actually, what they do is they focus on a single engine strategy. So they focus on one of those two topics and pretty much exclude the other one. That leads to all kinds of situations. You see companies saying, "I'll grow at all costs and postpone monetization." You see some who would say, "I'm going to monetize earlier on," but they might miss out on acquisition opportunities. Or yet others who are so focused on a small set of loyal customer base that they're neither monetizing nor are they actually acquiring.

(00:08:17):
So the good founders need to be able to dominate both market share and wallet share. It is not a choice. You need to get better at both. But this does not mean that you're putting equal effort on market share and wallet share at all given points in time, but it means you're putting equal attention on both those topics and being thoughtful about the trade-offs and saying, "How can I actually look at these two topics together so that I'm architecting towards profitable growth?" That's the core thesis of the book.

(00:08:47):
We actually showcase nine strategies that actually allow companies to architect towards profitable growth. And every chapter ends with how this particular strategy circumvents a single-engine problem and helps you focus on market share and wallet share at the same time. And there's also CEO questions and leadership questions that people should reflect on when they architect towards profitable growth and are they on the right track? I mean, think about this ways. If you're flying a aircraft, you don't want to flight on one engine. Why do you actually want to do that for your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:09:21):
Okay. So I imagine many founders or people thinking about starting a company are not feeling like they're in one bucket or another. Intuitively, you're not like, "Oh, Of course. We're going to just focus on growth forever, and that's all that matters."

(00:09:36):
You had these kind of traps that founders fall into that you referenced a bit. Can you just talk again about just the common traps you find founders fall into that people may recognize like, "Shit, that's what I'm doing probably"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:09:47):
So let's unpack the traps that are correlated to the archetypes. If you're a disruptor archetype, you might fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might land, but you might not expand. As in your eagerness for acquiring, you might have actually given away a lot at less and you have given the farm away, but you don't have anything to expand to. That's the first trap you're likely to fall into.

(00:10:12):
The second trap that you actually fall into is you start... A market share that won, is different from a market share that is actually held. If you're so acquisition focused, you're actually focused on getting more and more customers, but you're not spending enough time with customers that you actually got to keep them, upsell them, keep them happy, et cetera. So you might fall into that trap.

(00:10:34):
If you're a moneymaker, you fall into one of two traps. The first one is you might nickel and dime your customers to death. Because you're focused on monetization, you might come up with a very differentiated pricing model, different levels, hidden fees, things to charge for many different things and come across as just trying to nickel and dime your customer.

(00:10:53):
The second trap that a moneymaker actually falls into is that you fall into the price premium paradox where you think that pricing high actually indicates value, but your price is so high that you actually start hurting your acquisition, so it just becomes irrelevant for most people.

(00:11:13):
If you're in the community builder, you actually fall into two common traps. The first one is you're focused so much on the foundation that you actually miss the frontier, which is you're so focused on your loyal customer base that you forget to attract different types of customers and you're not acquiring.

(00:11:30):
And the second trap that you fall into if you're a community builder is you train your customers to expect more for less. Because you're so eager to satisfy your loyal base, you start giving them more and more, and you're training your best customer base to expect more for less.

(00:11:46):
So these six traps are very common across these archetypes. Being a profitable growth architect means that you're avoiding these traps. In other words, you're simultaneously being a disruptor, a moneymaker, and a community builder all at the same time. And how do you actually have that archetype and the right strategies to actually go about your business?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):
Okay. So this is what you want to not do. You mentioned you have nine strategies for how you actually want to approach pricing, monetization, scaling, monetization, and innovation. Can you share a couple of these strategies, maybe two or three, maybe some of your favorites?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:12:21):
Sure. So I will unpack a couple of strategies. Maybe the first one I would take is what we call as beautifully simple pricing. So in your early days it is by far more important to have pricing that is really simple and it's not creating too much friction in the sales conversation. I mean, the asset test that you probably should go back on Monday morning and do is take some of your early prospects or customers and ask them to articulate the pricing strategy back to you, right? If they were to actually sell on your behalf, how would they describe the pricing strategy? And if they cannot contextualize that in a simple manner and actually explain, you don't have a simple pricing strategy. It's as simple as that.

(00:13:02):
And having a simple pricing strategy also means that your pricing needs to be able to tell a value story, as in you need to contextualize your price based on the value that you actually bring to the table.

(00:13:15):
A great example here is Superhuman. When they started, they were actually competing with free email products and they were coming up with a premium email experience. And how do you actually price that? And I thought the team at Superhuman with Rahul and others did a pretty good job. They came up with a $30 price point per month, which was pretty simple. But the way they kind of told the story was that you pay a dollar a day for actually getting four hours of productivity back in the week, and then suddenly the pricing doesn't look too off. I mean, it's like the price for a latte in a week to actually get four hours back. Why wouldn't I actually do that, right?

(00:13:50):
And pricing contextualization and value story doesn't need to just apply for premium products. If you take another example, like the Subway $5 footlong is a different way to say a story with pricing that, oh, for $5, you get a lot of value actually back. So beautifully simple pricing really means coming up with a simple pricing strategy that your customers immediately get and your pricing is actually telling a value story and how do you actually get that. So in the book, we have a checklist of 10 different things that you actually need to look at to make sure that your pricing is beautifully simple.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:25):
As we go through these strategies, is your advice try all these things, like you should do as many of these strategies as you can, or is it maybe pick a few that work for you or just one is enough?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:14:34):
So there are nine strategies. We have organized that into strategies that apply during your startup phase, like just when you get started, and strategies that apply to you in your scale-up phase. So there are four strategies that you need to do in your startup and five in the scale-up, so it's quite manageable. I would argue that all four apply in the startup and all five actually apply in the scale-up phase, but it's not like you need to start focusing on nine things from day one.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:59):
So this first one was the startup phase?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:15:01):
Yeah. The beautifully simple pricing is the startup. Exactly. And so in the scale-up phase, I think one of the most important strategies is to master negotiations and really get better at acing negotiations, especially if you're in a B2B situation. And how do you actually do that? Because you need to be able to talk about the value and contextualize your price based on those kind of conversations.

(00:15:25):
So to master negotiations, it comes down to actually three things. Mastering gives and gets, being good at value selling, and third, having the right negotiation strategies. So let's unpack that each at a time.

(00:15:39):
So giving and getting, why is that important? Because in a negotiation, typically you're giving. I mean, you're giving concessions. People are asking. If you don't get anything back, you're basically indicating to the other person that they can keep beating you up and you need to keep giving. But if you're giving something but you ask for something in exchange, then you're basically bringing authenticity into the negotiation because it actually means something to you to give, so you're asking something back. It actually makes the negotiation way more effective.

(00:16:10):
And in the book we actually talk about the top 10 gets in B2B and the top 10 gets in B2C. One of my favorite gets in the B2B situation is what I call as conducting a value audit. So what this means is if you're giving a concession, ask for a value audit in exchange where every six months a team internally from your customers would be commissioned to actually conduct a value assessment of your products so that it becomes their business case and you co-create it with them saying how much value is actually produced. And this is great because if they actually engage in that, that gives you tremendous pricing power for renegotiations because it is their business case, they're championed it internally, and you're pretty much making your products pretty sticky. So it's a pretty harmless get, but it could be very powerful for future negotiations. So being good at-

Lenny Rachitsky (00:17:00):
That's really smart.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:17:01):
... gives and gets is... Thank you. Being good at gives and gets is really critical.

(00:17:07):
The second thing in mastering negotiations is being good at value selling. And for being good at value selling, you need to do three things. First, you need to be able to create the needs. Second, you need to be able to create affirmation loops. And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And let's talk about each of those. So creating needs is very important because many founders show up and try to understand what are the needs of the customers. That's one way to look at it. But you need to be able to create needs rather than just discover them.

(00:17:38):
So for instance, if you're a marketing automation AI product and you save, let's say, three weeks of work that actually needs to be done to actually get stuff in a dashboard that can be analyzed by marketing managers, the way you create the need is ask about existing processes and say, "Okay, so just so I understand, all of this stuff actually takes you three weeks to put data together to actually have meaningful dashboards for your marketing managers to take action. What if that was available to you instantaneously?" Oh, you have now just created a need, right? So being in that mindset of creating a need as opposed to just discovering them.

(00:18:17):
The second thing is creating affirmation loops. And this is really important. I've seen a lot of founders get into negotiations. They're so eager to talk about their products. They keep talking about the products without any affirmation from the other side. You need to pause and create affirmation loops, things like, for instance, "Okay, so far, you've seen all of this. How does this actually play out in your company? Do you see it as valuable? What about this dashboard do you actually like?"

(00:18:44):
So when you ask these kind of questions and your customers are playing back the value that they actually see in your product, you're creating affirmation loops, which become tremendously useful when you start selling the product finally. Because if they've agreed that there's value that is being produced, then you also have a better commercial discussion.

(00:19:03):
And the third one is creating a good ROI model. And I see a lot of founders work on a POC. And after the POC's over, they'll show up with an ROI model and try to defend a price. You've already lost the battle. I mean, no one is going to believe an ROI model that you just cooked up. Everyone is going to challenge you on assumptions.

(00:19:22):
The right way to think about an ROI model is to actually co-create it with your customers from day one, which means agree and validate on the assumptions and the inputs. So like, "Hey, how long does this process take today? How many engineers are there?" So you create ask questions that are all inputs to an ROI model. And if you have done that process and the customer agrees on all the inputs, they're very unlikely to push back on the output of an ROI model. So a POC needs to be framed as the purpose of a POC is to build a business case, and we are going to co-create an ROI model with the customer as opposed to it being a tech and product functionality feature test and you show up with an ROI model.

(00:20:06):
And when you're building an ROI model, there are many buckets to focus on, but there are three that are very critical. The first one is, what are the incremental gains that you actually bring to the table based on KPIs and metrics that your customer is tracking? So this could be things like incremental revenue, reduction in churn. These are the immediate, tangible, clear impact to the business line based on the products that you actually bring to the table.

(00:20:33):
The second bucket is cost savings. Are you reducing headcount? Are you reducing license costs? What are the tangible cost savings?

(00:20:41):
And the third one, which is often overlooked, is opportunity cost. For instance, if you save 10 hours of time for a team, what do they actually do with that 10 hours? That can also be quantified. So when you put all of these three things together, you start building a proper ROI model that you can actually use in your value selling to defend the right price.

(00:21:02):
So we talked about three steps in mastering negotiations. The first one was gives and gets. The second one was getting better at value selling. The third one is actually getting better at even negotiations and what strategies would you actually use. And there are a couple of strategies that we have found to be really productive.

(00:21:20):
The first one is to show up with options. Many founders rush with one product and one price and say, "Okay, this is a hundred K product, and that's what we are trying to sell." Inevitably, what will happen is the immediate focus of the conversation will be on the price, and you're only talking about price.

(00:21:39):
But if you have options on the table, let's say if you have a good, better, best, if you're a hundred K product, a 200K and a 300K option, then you're not just talking price, you're talking value. Because if your customer is budget conscious, they'll say, "Hey, I like the hundred K price point, but I actually like the functionality in your 200K product." Then your immediate question is, what in the functionality do you actually like? Why is that beneficial for you? So you switch the conversation back to value as opposed to just talking about price. And we have seen that with these kind of conversations, you're by far more better off to actually land in a much better place than just showcasing one product and one price.

(00:22:18):
And showcasing options doesn't need to be just different products. It could even be a pricing model choice. And I'd probably give a simple hack that people can try on Monday morning. I was talking to this founder who said, "Hey, I think the budget is about 100K. That's what I believe from the key stakeholder, but my product really brings crazy value. I could even charge, let's say, a 500K for this product, but I don't have the courage to actually go and ask for a 500K price because I kind of know a hundred K is the budget. What should I do?" So for those kind of situations, actually show up with options in your pricing model.

(00:22:58):
So we coached him to go in with a hundred K, plus 10% on any incremental value that you bring, or it's a 500K fixed. So now this is actually a great situation in negotiation. Because if you're price sensitive, you're focused on the hundred K. It's a small fee to actually get started. But the conversation will gravitate towards, "What is that 10%? How do you measure value?" That's a great conversation to have because now you're talking about, "How you add value? Where's the value generation? What portion would you take?"

(00:23:28):
And you see one of two situations. Either the customer say, "That's great. You're putting skin in the game. Let's go with a hundred K and 10%," or, 80% of the situations, you might actually want to avoid the outcome-based pricing as a buyer, but you're not really fixated on the 500K at that point. It is the premium that you're actually paying for the certainty. So no one is focusing on the 5K because of the hundred K option on the table, and you just put a 500K and got the courage to do that. And in this specific situation, that 500K got negotiated to 400K, and they just 4X the deal compared to where they would be. So having options on the table when you negotiate is critical.

(00:24:05):
And there's also some tactics that we showcase in the book, like anchoring is important. If you start high, you'll also end up higher. And also tapering concessions. How do you give concessions? I mean, the worst negotiators will start by giving a small concession and then give a bit more when someone asks like... You might give a 5% discount, and the procurement guy says, "That's not enough." "Okay, I'll give you 10% more." "Okay, that's not enough." "I'll give you 15." What are you indicating to the other person? You're just basically indicating that I can keep beating you up and I can get more discounts.

(00:24:35):
The best negotiators who taper the concessions. So they would say, "I can give you 15%." "Okay, I need more." "I'll give you five." "I need more." "I'll give you two." So you're automatically indicating to the other person that the negotiation's actually ending. So how do you taper concessions also become important.

(00:24:51):
So when you put all of these three things together, if you master your gives and gets, you get better at value selling, and you use the right negotiation strategy, you can extract full value from every deal. That's probably way more important when you're at the scale-up phase.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):
This is such great advice. I love that this is just one small chapter of your book. This could make or break your company. It's interesting that you have a whole thing on negotiation in a book about scaling innovation and growing your company. Is the assumption here that your pricing and monetization is so impacted by how well you negotiate because that changes your entire pricing structure and how much you're making? Is that why you put so much effort into this part?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:25:31):
Exactly. I mean, in a B2B situation, you can set all the pricing you want, come up with great pricing models. But at least even today, it's a human having a human conversation trying to negotiate. So if you cannot contextualize what you put on the table, how do you negotiate around value, how do you contextualize your price, you're leaving a lot of money on the table.

(00:25:49):
So to us, negotiations is yet another monetization topic where you're thinking about it as extracting full value from every deal. And this is not just negotiation tactics, like keep your boss at home and just negotiate and things like that. This is actual negotiation strategies that are rooted on value selling, gives and gets, and focusing on extracting full value from every deal.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:14):
So useful. This idea of throwing out a third higher priced option, say 500K, it's so interesting. Because usually the advice I hear is like, "Just throw out twice the number you used to... " Just put it out there just in case, which is really scary to ask for like, "What about $50,000?" And this is like a much less scary way of doing that. "Okay, but we also have this 500K option. Here's what you get." And then they may be like, "Oh, that's exactly what we want." And you're like, "Oh, wow. It worked."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:40):
Exactly. It's a very simple hack to get your courage.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):
That is so cool.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:44):
Put a good price point.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:45):
Wow, this is awesome. This is just like a golden nugget within golden nuggets of advice. Okay. So you have nine strategies. We've covered two. Let's not get into them, but just what are a few more just so people know what else they might be able to learn?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:26:59):
Sure. We talk about how to land and expand, as in how to design your best free product in such a way that you are landing, but also expanding. We talk about things like how to have the right packaging strategy, how to stop churn before it happens, how to do price increases effectively. Because at some point in your scale-up journey, you need to increase price, but how do you do that meaningful fashion?

(00:27:24):
So we have various strategies that apply both for the startup and the scale-up phase. But in combination, all of those things help you articulate and architect towards profitable growth.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):
Awesome. Okay. Let's talk about AI for a bit. A lot of your book is about how AI pricing is very different from other previous traditional pricing strategies. And it feels like every company wants to be an AI company these days, so I think this is going to apply to a lot of people. How is AI pricing different?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:27:51):
Yeah, AI pricing is very different from the previous vintage of companies. Why is that so? Because AI founders need to tackle monetization from the very early days, like day one in their seed stage pre-seed kind of thing, which was not probably the focus for the previous SaaS companies. Why is that? So because of two reasons.

(00:28:11):
One, for the first time there's cost dynamics to actually navigate. So you need to think about monetization from day one. But there's also a more critical reason, which is value capture. Because with AI products, you're actually bringing a lot of value to the table. And if you don't capture that from day one, then you're training your customers to expect more for less.

(00:28:31):
So for instance, think about this. If you're building a agentic AI product that taps into labor budgets, labor budgets are 10X compared to software budgets. So if you use all the old playbooks, then you're under monetizing, again, from day one and training your customers to expect more for less. So how do you come up with foundational models that actually allow you to capture the value that you bring to the table?

(00:28:55):
And why has this become critical? Because with AI, finally, founders can really solve the attribution problem. In the previous vintages... For instance, if you take Slack, you can say that the productivity went up, efficiency happened, but you cannot measure it, monitor it, attribute it to Slack. Okay, that's probably why they were in a seed-based pricing model.

(00:29:17):
But in today's situations, you see companies that say, "In a Fortune 100 company, I was able to improve throughput by 10%, reduce crap by 5%." And when you get into those kinds of situation where an AI is creating core value and it's attributable to the AI, you get a lot of pricing power.

(00:29:35):
So the two questions that we commonly hear from AI founders is, "How do I set the right pricing model?" as in, "How do I charge?" which becomes way more important than how much you charge. Because the underlining business model has changed. We have moved from software being a pay for access to now you're paying for work delivered. So the monetization model's become key. That is the first question that people actually ask us.

(00:30:05):
The second one is, "How do I navigate POCs, commercial discussions early?" Because the buyer on the other side also wants to see the value before they engage in a commercial discussion." So those two topics become very critical, and we have showcased a lot of this in the book.

(00:31:34):
Let's talk about this POC piece because I think this is something a lot of people deal with. And then I want to talk about this two-by-two that you have in the book. And I'll actually pull it up. So let's talk about POCs first.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:31:43):
So POCs, when we talk about POCs, many founders think about a POC as a proof of technical functionality, and is their product actually working in their customer environments. And they set up the expectation that we are saying, "Hey, we are going to put the product, and we're going to see if it actually works." And they would probably say, "Should I charge for a POC versus not?" And we'll unpack that in a bit, should you or should you not.

(00:32:10):
And that's actually a completely wrong way of framing it. The POC should be framed as the entire goal of the POC is to create a business case, period, full stop. It is not to demonstrate product functionality fit within your customer environment's ability to integrate. All of that stuff is a consequence of the business case.

(00:32:30):
So if you frame it this way is you can say, "Look, it is a 30-day pilot for co-creating an ROI model and building a business case along with their users. If we see value at the end of the 30 days based on the business case, we can get to commercial discussions." So that way you've actually not talked about your price. You're only focused on co-creating a business case with the customer. And based on the business case, you can actually come up with a proper commercial agreement. And if they see value, they're going to pay you for it. So thinking about the POCs in that kind of manner.

(00:33:03):
And the question that I often get asked is, "Should I charge for a POC?" And the answer is yes, but smartly. Let's talk about why it's important to charge. The reason you need to charge for a POC is you start isolating people who are just tire kickers versus serious buyers. It becomes a lead qualification mechanism. If you didn't have that, you're going to attract all of these curious buyers who are just curious about AI. They just want to see if it works or not. They will say, "Yes, I'll engage with the POC." They will take 30, 60, 90 days with you. They will burn a lot of resources, never buy. You've just wasted your time. Time is of the essence. So having a price tag to your POC actually indicates that there is seriousness on both sides, so you should charge.

(00:33:48):
But how do you actually charge for it? You need to charge for it smartly. What this means is that you need to make sure that your POC pricing is not a reflection of your actual commercial deal. Because let's say if you just say it's a 10K POC for a 30-day pilot. If you don't talk about the fact that it is not the same as your commercial discussion, you have now set an anchor that, okay, it's 120K per year kind of deal if the POC works. So you have to be clear that the 10K is only for building a business case. Commercial discussions will follow after that. It is not an indication of the actual commercial discussion.

(00:34:28):
But your buyer on the other side might still push you saying, "That's all great, but I need a price or a budget, otherwise I won't move forward with it." So there are two ways to actually deflect those kind of questions. The first way is contextualize the price on the value. So you can say something like, if you're pushed for price, "Hey, for customers such as yours, we have been able to at least unlock 10 million in very similar situations. And our pricing is... One is to 10X when it comes to ROI."

(00:34:58):
So you basically said that you're a million dollars to actually get started, but you actually didn't say it. You just said, "It's a 10 million, and I'm taking one in 10 in exchange for it." So you've given the buyer an indication, but you've framed it in such a manner that actually is justifiable, right? A one in 10X ROI. So that's one way to do it.

(00:35:16):
They might still say, "Yeah, that's good, but I need a budget." So then rather than just give them a budget saying, "It could be a 200K option," don't do that. That's the worst thing you can actually say. Give them a range. You can say something like, "Look, the final pricing would be anywhere from 500K to a million. And based on the business case that we would co-create with you, we can pick a point in that range that justifies the value that we bring to the table." So you're giving budgetary ranges, right? So that's the other way to actually go about POCs.

(00:35:46):
So how you navigate your early wins, who you choose is very critical when you're building companies at scale and fast in AI because that actually dictates the destiny for the rest of your future. And picking those early wins is very, very critical. And having buyers who are serious, lead qualifying, having the right POC process, and thinking about POCs as, frankly, not just trying to see if your product actually works and delivers value, but it's a great chance to have a commercial test-and-learn experiment and have fun with it and try to see what you can bring to the table in terms of your value and what portion can you actually take.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:26):
So the core takeaway here is, for AI companies, you no longer can just grow and figure out monetization later. Your advice here is what you start with is what you're going to end up with, and it's very easy to under monetize because people aren't realizing that they're now helping with actual labor force savings versus just SaaS software that's making people a little bit more efficient.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:36:50):
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I strongly believe that the winners in AI will need to master monetization, and they need to master it from day one. And when we talk to early-stage founders, it is a topic that keeps many people up at night, but that's also why we wrote Scaling Innovation and other assets so that they can get some more courage to think about pricing correctly from day one. And it's become very critical for AI companies to do that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:16):
Do you feel like the popular IDE startups, I won't name names, do you think they've under monetized and they're going to be in trouble down the road?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:37:24):
Some of them for sure have. I think they will probably run out of it because they might show a lot of, let's say, fast revenue growth, but is that enduring revenue? Are people actually going to stay? And is there going to be churn? And so there are a lot of aspects to marketing profitable growth. It's not just growing fast, but also growing profitably and having an enduring business. So some of them, yes, without naming names. But yeah, I think that's why it's important to be thoughtful about market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:37:54):
Well, those are different. I think what you're saying here is the retention may not work for some of these companies. But on the other hand, they're really cheap. 20 bucks a month to help your engineer be 10 times more productive potentially, is that too good a deal? Do you think they should have priced a lot higher?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:38:11):
Yeah, for sure. I mean, if you're bringing a lot of value to the table and you started training your customers to expect $20 a month and you anchored yourself on a low price point, I think there are companies that have actually done that. And they try to undo it with having more sophisticated, let's say, products that are actually higher priced or much higher priced, et cetera. That's one way to undo that situation.

(00:38:32):
So it's really a trade-off between getting more customers and making money at the same time. That's the whole point of the book, market share and wallet share, and how do you dominate both. So if they're being thoughtful about both and have a vision to not just grow market share, but also have a clear strategy to land and expand and increase wallet share, those strategies might pan out for those types of companies. If you just threw out a $20 product hoping to just accelerate your market share, you're in trouble.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):
Okay. This is a great segue to this two-by-two, which goes much deeper into this. So it's easy to be like, "Here's what you shouldn't do." Here's your advice on what to actually do. So I'm going to pull up on my screen this two-by-two that you have in your book. So if you're watching YouTube, you'll be able to see it.

(00:39:13):
So talk about this. This is essentially how to figure out the best possible pricing model and where you have the most power.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:39:20):
So when you talk about AI companies and monetization models, we get asked this question. "Should I be usage-based? Should I be outcome? Should I be a copilot mode? Or how do I actually think about my pricing model?" So we came up with this framework, which is a relatively simple, straightforward framework, but very powerful.

(00:39:39):
So there are two axes here. One is attribution, and the other one is autonomy. And when you have high attribution and high autonomy, that is when you have high pricing power, and we'll come back to that in a bit, right?

(00:39:51):
So let's take the first bottom-left quadrant. That is the quadrant where your attribution is low and your autonomy is low. In that situation, the best pricing archetype that actually fits is it is actually a seed-based or a subscription model because there's not much to do about it because you're not being able to attribute a lot of value to what you bring, but you're in a copilot mode and you're not in an autonomous mode, so a seed-based pricing would actually make sense.

(00:40:18):
But if you're at that quadrant, the immediate thing to think about is, how do you actually build more attribution and move to the right so that you actually get more pricing power? So if you think about the bottom-right quadrant, those are companies that have actually done that. They can prove more attribution to what they actually bring to the table, but they are still not in a fully autonomous mode, as in there is still humans in the loop.

(00:40:43):
If you take Cursor, for instance, it definitely improves productivity, can actually bring down the time to actually do code, the attribution is clear, but it's still in a copilot mode. In those kind of situations, a hybrid pricing model is the best option where you still have a seed-based model for the copilot kind of use case, but you also layer in a consumption model which actually says there are a certain number of AI credits or tokens that can layer in the usage aspects. So if you use more and more, then you're actually paying more on consumption. So it's a hybrid model that actually works there.

(00:41:18):
If you look at the top-left quadrant, those are products that are very autonomous but are not strong on attribution. So these tend to be mostly backend or infrastructure kind of products that are core critical to run businesses, can be autonomous, but they're not directly impacting the KPIs that businesses are tracking, and hence cannot prove attribution very effectively. So in that situation, you need to be on a pay-for-what-you-consume and a usage-based model. A seed-based model would not make sense because it's autonomous. There's no human in the loop. But that's why you're also in a usage-based model, saying the more you use it, the more you're actually charged. And usage becomes a proxy for the value that you bring to the table.

(00:42:07):
The quadrant that you really want to be in is the golden quadrant, which is the top-right one. That's the outcome-based pricing model where you have great autonomy and great attribution. And here is where I think AI can be really magical. So this means you're not only charging for work delivered, but you're charging for work delivered that was delivered by AI without no humans in the loop. So that becomes more of an outcome-based model situation.

(00:42:35):
So a classic example here is Intercom for Fin. What they actually do is they charge based on an AI resolution. So if an AI is able to resolve the ticket completely independently without a human in the loop, then they charge for it. If a human intervention is needed, they don't charge for it. So they're more on an outcome-based model. Or companies like Charge Flow would charge up to 25% on a charge bag that they're able to actually recover, because these are core savings that you actually bring to the table based on your AI. It is highly attributable, highly autonomous so you can start moving towards an outcome-based pricing model.

(00:43:14):
If you look at the state of where AI is today, as of the day of recording this podcast, now, the most popular model is right now a hybrid pricing model. So because this is also expected, because the previous SaaS playbook was usually on the seat-based model, but they've all now moved on to at least a hybrid to actually incorporate AI credits and usage, et cetera, about 5% of companies are probably in a true outcome-based pricing model as of today. But those companies, some of the best ones are able to recover 25 to 50% of the value that they actually bring to the table.

(00:43:54):
In the classic SaaS situation, we used to say if you can charge 10 to 20% of the value, that's actually great. But in AI, you can actually charge 25 to 50% because it is autonomous, you're doing it with the AI. There's no humans in the loop. You are creating incremental value to the business metrics. You are producing hard-cost savings. There's opportunity costs. You can justify all of that. It's attributable. So you can actually take 25 to 50% of what you bring to the table.

(00:44:22):
In a lot of benchmarks and studies that actually show, and this is also my belief, that in the next three years that 5% number will move to 25%. So what this really means is if you want to win in AI, figure out a way to get to that quadrant because that's a magic quadrant. If you can truly price based on outcomes, you've achieved and unlock tremendous value.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):
Wow. Okay. I'm just going to pause again. This is amazing. Madhavan, thank you so much for it. I love, again, that you just spent years, decades studying this stuff, come here, tell us all the answers of what we should be doing. This is incredible.

(00:45:01):
Let me ask you this. By the way, for folks not watching on YouTube, the companies you have in the golden quadrant, outcome-based pricing, Sierra, Fin, and Chargeflow. We've got the founder of Sierra and Fin coming on the podcast soon, so we'll talk about all this with those guys.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:16):
Awesome.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):
So is the way to use this two-by-two figuring out your model? Is it like, "Okay, I'm like Cursor. I'm going to go in this quadrant," or is it, "How do I get to outcome-based no matter what? That's where I need to be"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:45:32):
Yeah, so that's a great question. The first one is to actually figure out what is your right archetype based on where you are today. I think that is most important. If you try to rush into an outcome-based pricing model but cannot prove attribution, you will fail. So it is really coming up with what is the right archetype based on what I'm doing today, but also use this two-by-two to say, "How do I paint a vision to actually get to outcome based? And can I get close to that? Or can I be purely an outcome-based model? How do I evolve into that?"

(00:46:05):
What that would mean is, how do I build functionality in the products to actually show attribution, how do I build more agentic workforces to take the human out of the loop and be more autonomous, and being thoughtful about your vision and strategy so that you will orient yourself towards more outcome-based pricing models. So when you think about increasing attribution, that means, first of all, understanding what are the KPIs of your customers. How do they track their business performance? Can you impact it? Can you productize things in your product that showcase that you are actually affecting those KPIs in a positive manner? Can you build dashboards to show value attribution? Can you do those value audits that we talked about on an ongoing basis to actually show that you're bringing a lot of value to the table and is attributable to you? So how do you create these kind of attribution mechanisms become important and also autonomous based on building more agentic workforces that can actually be on an autonomous mold?

(00:47:04):
So pick the right archetype and plan to get to as close as you can to the outcome-based pricing model. That's how I would use the two-by-two. And you actually kind of see this happening with certain industries, right? If you think about coding as a overall category... Like back in the day with GitHub, everyone, they started with a seed-based model. They've now moved to the hybrid-based pricing model with Cursors and everyone else, but the natural move would be more towards a outcome-based pricing model where a AI agent can probably code everything at the same time, debug it, and you're kind of almost hiring a AI developer or AI QA person. And that actually becomes more closer to a outcome-based model because it's attributable and autonomous. So that is picking the right archetype and then figuring out your pathway is the key way to interpret this two-by-two.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):
This explains why everyone's pulling agents. That's where the money's at, what you're telling us here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:00):
Yeah. It's going to be the age of The Matrix. Too many agents.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):
Agent Smiths everywhere. They didn't turn out too great. So what I'm hearing is if I were Canva... So Canva here in your model is bottom right. They're in a hybrid pricing model. They have a base fee and consumption fee. What you would do if you were helping Canva is what can you build that creates more autonomy, an autonomous version of Canva? And it's not like you need to do this. It's just you have more pricing power if you figure something out there.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:48:31):
Exactly. And a good case for that is the Fin product from Intercom. Because traditionally, all of those kind of companies used to price based on an agent basis. How many customer service agents are actually using the product? It used to be seed based, but they built out Fin, which is a completely AI resolution for those kind of support tickets. And then that actually enables them to move to the outcome-based pricing model quadrant.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):
Amazing. So say you're an AI founder today. You're thinking about your pricing strategy, your monetization strategy long term. Your advice is work with design partners, create these POCs where you work on this ROI model with them to ideally find some outcome-based pricing strategy. Is that a good way to summarize it? What would you add to that?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:17):
Yes. I mean, at least be able to contextualize the business case. Even if you're not moving to an outcome-based pricing model, be clear on the outcome that you're actually creating for your customers through that business case, which actually will enable you to charge a fair price in exchange for that outcome. And if your customers agree with the business case, then you can actually take a portion of that.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:43):
Fin, actually, they're a new sponsor of the podcast, and I learned... I didn't know this. It costs 99 cents for every support ticket they solve [inaudible 00:49:51].

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:51):
Through AI.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):
Through AI.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:49:53):
Exactly. If it needs a human intervention, then they don't charge for it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:49:56):
Yeah. And it's just like, what? That's such a simple story. Your agent costs 20 bucks. This thing costs 99 cents

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:03):
Yeah. That is two chapters in one beautifully simple pricing and an outcome-based pricing model.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:09):
And interestingly, they were the most hated pricing model initially. I did a survey on Twitter ones, like, "What products do you pay the most for?" and it was always Intercom. And everyone hated their pricing, and they found a solution.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:21):
I think they found a great solution.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:50:23):
Okay. So is there anything else along these lines that you think companies, especially AI companies, should be thinking when they're thinking about pricing that you'd want to share before we move on to other stuff?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:50:34):
I think we've covered most of the topics. Like we said, it's being thoughtful about POCs, choosing the right pricing archetype or the pricing models. Those things become very critical in the early stages. But when you start scaling and, let's say, you become a multi-product company, then you need to start focusing on, "What kind of packaging strategy should I have? Is it a platform plus add-ons? Should I have versions of the products like good, better, best? Should I tackle different use cases because now my AI can solve an insurance use case and a healthcare use case? Should I productize to different use cases? Is that my packaging strategy? Or should I keep it completely modularized for people to pick and choose?"

(00:51:17):
So these kind of questions become more critical, and that's why the chapter on blowing up your packaging from your early days and coming up with your packaging strategy for your scale-up phase become very critical. So I think that's the next thing that founders would be hit with, as in when they build multiple products, they need to think about the whole packaging, cross-selling, up-selling motion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):
This touches on something I was about to ask, which is a change in your pricing strategy. How often is it a success to change the way you price? I know we're talking about you need to get it right from the beginning if you're an AI company. In your experience, how often... What does it take to successfully shift the way you price down the road if people are listening to this and are like, "Shit, we already have this pricing strategy"?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:52:00):
Back in the day, we used to say that you should revisit your pricing strategy, overall pricing model, how much you're charging at least once in two years. With AI, that's probably reduced in half because of the scale with which and the speed with which companies are built and competing.

(00:52:16):
So I would say that it is an ongoing journey. It is not like you just solve it in day one, fill it, and forget it. You have to be thoughtful from day one, but also be ready to pivot, iterate, and you're going to learn along your journey. So the whole point is to think about pricing as also a test-and-learn opportunity in your early days.

(00:52:38):
And there are things that you would change more often, and there are things that you probably don't want to change too often. Things like pricing model, unless you really changed your attribution autonomy, there is no need to shift your pricing model. Stay within that archetype. Don't confuse things.

(00:52:54):
But there are things like price points. Should I increase my price because it's been six months a year? Yeah, you should. Because in a year there's probably prices go up three to 5% for everything that you consume. But how can you actually increase your prices and be thoughtful about it? So that entire chapter on how to do price increases smartly become very important in the scale-up phase.

(00:53:16):
I think Warren Buffett summarized this really well. He said the true definition of a company is a pricing power. And if you have a prayer session for doing a 10% price increase, you have a terrible business. So you have to be able to increase prices over a bit of time. But how do you do it strategically that does not affect too much churn, but you're also able to pass on the increase as a value exchange, those things become critical.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:53:39):
Awesome. Zooming out a little bit, something that I love about your book is you structured it around these axioms. You have a bunch of these really clever axioms that get stuck in your head and help you think about pricing. Can you share some of your favorites, maybe two or three referred axioms from the book?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:53:55):
You talked about Sierra being in your park founders. I don't know if that's Clay, but here's a shout-out for Clay. So Clay actually read the entire book and gave me feedback, Scaling Innovation, the similar copy that he actually had. I called it Scaling Innovation Axioms throughout the book. And the whole point of the axioms was that at the end of the day, if you can just take all the axioms, put it in a printout next to your desk is the summary of the book. And it's like PT statements that you'll just remember what to do.

(00:54:26):
So he came up with this idea that, "Hey, rather than calling them just generic scaling innovation axioms, you need to brand each and every axiom." And I thought that was a brilliant idea. So I went about coming up with a unique... He even contributed to some of the names. We came up with some unique names for each axiom.

(00:54:45):
And here's the other fun fact. Probably I'm geeking out too much. But when I counted the number of axioms, there were 42 axioms. And I didn't try to make this up. And if you're a Hitchhiker's fan, then you know that's the answer to everything.

(00:54:58):
But jokes apart, let me unpack a few axioms. One of my first favorite axioms, what I call is the 20-80 axiom. Especially in tech companies, 20% of what you build drives 80% of the willingness to pay. But the irony is that the 20% is the easiest thing to build often. So what founders do is they take this 20%, build it, put it out in the market almost for free, and then they're chasing their tails to build 80% stuff that's only driving 20% willingness to pay. So if you have not been thoughtful about that, you've given the farm away unintentionally.

(00:55:37):
So truly understanding what drives willingness to pay in your product is critical. And I think people call it the MVP. I think we should change the definition of MVP. It shouldn't be minimum viable product, it should be the most valuable product. And be thoughtful about what are you actually giving out as your early products I think is key. That's the 20-80 axiom.

(00:55:58):
Probably my second one is the price paralysis axioms. So what that means is your reluctance to do a price increase is often internal and emotional and it's not external and logical. This goes back to the same prayer session to actually do a price increase. If you're holding hands, you have a terrible business. So it's mostly internal and emotional, and how do you be thoughtful about price increases become important.

(00:56:29):
Probably my third favorite one is stopping churn before it happens, so stopping churn axiom. So to stop churn, you need to attract customers who won't leave. That sounds counterintuitive, but that's the best way to actually stop churn. What does this actually mean? Most companies will try to stop churn when someone actually says, "I want to go." It is too late, and you're being reactive. At the most, you'll throw some offers. They will stay for another six months, and they will leave. They've already made that determination.

(00:56:59):
The way to stop churn is to start acquiring customers who won't leave. And that is the most important thing. So if you look back at your data and say, "Who are the types of customers who actually tend to stay longer? What are their characteristics? How can I focus my acquisition dollars in getting more of those?" then you stop churn before it happens. And that's the key.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):
That's interesting. I'm surprised you didn't say what was my favorite, which is... I think it's like, "If you land, make sure to expand."

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:28):
Yeah.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
That one really stuck with me.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:29):
That's a good one, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):
Maybe talk about that one. Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:57:32):
Sure. I mean, so if you land, you need to also make sure you're expanding, in the sense that if you give the farm away in your entry-level product, you don't have much to actually monetize later. So being thoughtful about what is the fence between your land product. Is it a free experience? What is the getting? And the getting is typically based on are you getting based on features? Are you also getting on usage? And how do you be thoughtful about that? So you leave stuff for the expansion.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):
Okay. So zooming out even further, to kind of wrap up, what would you say is the biggest lesson you want founders to take away that they think they understand but they probably don't?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:58:14):
Yeah, I think this comes back to what you started with. I think intuitively people get it that they need to think about market share and wallet share if they're growing. And even if you ask them, they'll say like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking about wallet share," but have they really thought about it equally and paid equal attention? Have they postponed one of them? Are they operating in a single-engine strategy consciously or subconsciously? I think that's the key takeaway I have.

(00:58:40):
So the contrarian take is not to put equal effort on both the engines at the same time. In certain stages of your company, you might need to be more market share dominating. In certain stages you might need to be wallet share dominating. It's not equal effort, but it's equal attention and really developing that mindset of being a true profitable growth architect. And that is the main takeaway that I have for people. And if you are not in that mindset already, there's a book for you.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:59:12):
I'll point them to it. So just so folks know what to do when they're like, "Okay, I need to focus on wallet share more," is the main focus figure out a pricing model that aligns well with pricing power, what's in the bucket of work to do to invest more in wallet-share thinking?

Madhavan Ramanujam (00:59:28):
So it's actually all of those. Market share, wallet share, acquisition, monetization, retention are all kind of correlated. You can't think about them in isolation. So I wouldn't say only for wallet share what do you need to do. If you want to grow on both the market share and wallet share... Let's say, for instance, you need to have the right land-and-expand strategy. The land helps you with acquisition. The expansion helps you with wallet share.

(00:59:54):
If you have a pricing model, then you need to have a pricing model that lets you acquire faster because it's intuitive, but it should also help you recover value, which is like your monetization. And if people understand your pricing model, they're actually going to stay. So it's all sort of goes hand in hand. So I wouldn't isolate thinking one way or the other. That's why the nine strategies actually are very powerful. Because if you follow those strategies, you are not going to fall into the single-engine strap. These are tried and tested strategies of how to build businesses in such a way that you're being thoughtful and paying equal attention to both market share and wallet share.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):
All right. That is a very reasonable answer. Madhavan, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:00:41):
Read the two books in sequence, Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. Because it's one thing to build a great product, it's yet another thing to build a great business. You cannot build a great business with a not-so-great product, and you cannot do it the other way around either. So I think it's thinking about pricing early, especially for AI companies, being thoughtful about it, price before product, and then thinking about how to actually scale, developing a profitable growth mindset. All of these things become critical. And I'm looking forward to the feedback from the audience.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):
I feel like your books are in the staple of founder reading. There's all these things you just don't know what you're doing. And there's a few of these books that are like, "Okay, here's all this advice that'll answer so many questions and save you so much heartache." And so I'm really excited you're adding something to that bookshelf. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:16):
Okay. Let's go.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):
Let's go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:01:41):
The first one that comes to mind is Business Model Canvas by Alex Osterwalder. It's a classic and one of my favorite books. I recommend a lot of people to read that because I think it nicely ties a lot of what we are also seeing from a more strategic business model angle.

(01:01:57):
I like this book, Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow. I think that's also a classic because, again, there's always a human element to things. And understanding the customer psychology is important whether you're in B2C or in B2B. Because if you're in a B2B situation, it's humans having a human conversation. So it's as much behavioral as it's actually numbers. So I love that book, and there's a lot of nuggets in there, so I recommend a lot.

(01:02:20):
And probably the third one that I recommend is a book called Contagious by Jonah Berger. I love that. He was in the PhD program at Stanford in marketing, and he actually wrote this book on how to make messages viral. And he's actually seen the best viral messages and boiled it down to a framework. And if you follow that, then you can make those messages viral. And I've tried to use some of those in my own outreaches and things of that nature, so I think it's a fantastic read.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:51):
Wow.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:52):
Have you read it?

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:53):
Got to check this out. I have not. I haven't even heard of it. All right. We're going to go viral because we got the playbook.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:02:57):
Contagious. That's the name of the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):
Contagious. Okay. We'll link to that. Is there a recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:04):
I guess a movie. Sure, let's pick a movie. Definitely enjoyed Mission Impossible, the final one, eighth in the sequence. I think I find that a whole... I love those, the entire genre, one through eight. But what I kind of like about it is my willingness to pay has constantly increased over a period of time. They could have charged me whatever they wanted for the eighth movie. I would've probably gone and seen it, when I wanted to. So I thought that's an interesting example of a durable brand where your monetization power actually increase over a period of time. So I think I enjoyed the movie. It was great. Yeah.

(01:03:43):
Hey, by the way, I just realized MI stands for Monetizing Innovation and also Mission Impossible. Maybe subconsciously that's why I liked it, too.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:52):
And you're the Tom Cruise character.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:03:53):
Yeah, exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):
I love how you're the only person in the world that thinks of Mission Impossible through a monetization, willingness-to-pay lens.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:00):
Exactly. I think there's too many of these dinner conversations also gravitate towards pricing and monetization. I think it's become my life.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):
Oh, man. We need a version of this movie, like a Mission Possible of Madhavan.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:14):
Sure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:04:14):
I'd pay anything for that. All right. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:04:22):
I would probably talk about two products. The first one is Delphi, the Digital Mind representation. There's a Lennybot that you actually, I think, put out. I find that product fascinating, and I also love the founders, Dara and Sam there. I truly believe that that is going to be the future for thought leadership and how thoughts are consumed by consumers.

(01:04:46):
And I've used your Lennybot. I really enjoy it, like if I can co-create some thought leadership piece with talking to you, but it's not you, your AI, and it's actually living and breathing your brain. How cool is that? And I think that I really love the product category. There's a lot of different use cases, longevity, extension, use cases, things of that nature. I'm excited about the product. I think it's been great. I plan to, taking inspiration from you, plan to create a Delphi of myself-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay. I was going to ask.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:15):
... at some point.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):
Okay.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:16):
I think it should be [inaudible 01:05:17]-

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):
So that one would... Yeah.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:05:18):
... the book maybe. I'll try to. That's the promise. Try to keep it ready. So I think if you want to talk more about the book or things of that nature and talk pricing, you can talk to my AI, too, right? I mean, I find the product fascinating.

(01:05:31):
The second one I would probably say that's been super useful in terms of just productivity is Granola. We love that product. I think just the ability to take notes and during all the meetings and organize it and being able to query things, et cetera. I think it's been a great product that we recently started trying and we've been really liking it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):
Cool. That's been the most mentioned product recently. How cool is that? Love Granola. Get a year free of Granola if you're a paid subscriber to my newsletter, lennysnewsletter.com. Click bundle, one year free for not just you, your whole team. What an offer they offered. It's crazy.

(01:06:05):
On Delphi, what's interesting about LennyBot is it's not just my knowledge, it's every single podcast guest's insights and lessons also fed into it. What an oracle of knowledge this thing's become. And it's free at this point, completely free. Lennybot.com. No, I get nothing from it. It's just out there.

(01:06:24):
Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:06:32):
Create value in everything and anything that you touch. Everything else will follow. That's my life motto.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):
That resonates deeply. Okay, last question. You recently moved into investing. So what's cool is it used to be very expensive to work with at Simon-Kucher, I think it was called. Very expensive. A lot of big company stuff. Now a lot of more founders have access to you because you're investing in startups. So just talk about that. Talk about what you're doing these days.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:07:00):
Sure. I mean, at Simon-Kucher, I got to work with over 250 companies. And my co-GP now, Josh Bloom, he also had an opportunity to work with our 250 companies. So combined, we worked with our 500 companies, more than 50-plus unicorns. It was a great ride.

(01:07:16):
And often, we were actually working with them in much later stages when series D or pre-IPO, post-IPO, private equity companies, et cetera. But the two of us actually now started a venture firm with an explicit goal of working with early-stage AI founders. And it goes back to the topic that we started with. AI companies needs to deal with monetization from day one. But for those kind of companies, fee-for-service transaction model doesn't necessarily work. And that's also why we pivoted to venture.

(01:07:51):
So our business model is pretty standard right now. You get access in the cap table. We roll up our sleeves and work with the founders in all things monetization. So we are invested in their success and we will partake in the value creation. There's no fee for service, no friction on those kind of manners. But on the flip side, we get to concentrate our efforts in fund one and probably 20 to 25 companies, and that's where we will be spending our time.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):
What a deal. Madhavan, two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and talk about this offer? And how can listeners be useful to you?

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:08:25):
Ways to find out, I think just google for Monetizing Innovation and Scaling Innovation. You'll probably land in a lot of pages. You can also go to Amazon, I think, if you want to purchase the books. Actually, Scaling Innovation is now available in pre-order. I think we'll have the pod released before the book is actually out. The book is going to be out on August 5th. So there's an opportunity to pre-order.

(01:08:48):
And maybe I will take an inspiration from your master bundle, which I really think is the world's best bundle, and come up with my own bundle for getting users to pre-order. So if you love Monetizing Innovation, I can tell you you would really love Scaling Innovation. So go buy it for your teams. Buy it for yourself.

(01:09:06):
And here's the offer. So for anyone who's able to buy more than five copies, send us a screenshot of your purchase pre-order, right? Send us a screenshot of your purchase to promo@49palmsvc.com. So that's promo, as in promotion, @49 P-A-L-M-S-V-C .com.

(01:09:30):
And here's the bundle offer that I have. 10 people will get access to bundles as a raffle, and the bundle is going to include a signed copy of Scaling Innovation, a 30-minute ask-me-anything session, an exclusive invite for a Scaling Innovation book launch, and also a Scaling Innovation t-shirt. So that's my coming up with a bundle. I didn't get Granola and others to put in for me just yet, but I think this hopefully suffices and is exciting for folks to buy.

(01:10:01):
And, yeah. I mean if you like the book, please do leave a review on Amazon. That always is helpful. Because if more people review it, the book takes a life of its own. And I'm really thankful for also the support that I got over the years from founder community, from the venture community for Monetizing Innovation. I think there's been, over the last eight years, thousands and thousands of fans of the books. They've done a whole lot talking about it, writing reviews, posting on LinkedIn, and making things like price before product or product market price fit and things as a part of founder vocabulary. So I'm very passionate that people actually did that and very thankful for them. So there's also probably an equal measure. If you're excited about Scaling Innovation, I would love for you to talk about the book.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):
Amazing. And I think the reason people do that is because you give away so much for free. You just shared so much wisdom for free that is going to help so many people, so it all comes back to you.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:05):
I just tried to plan my give and get right there.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):
There we go. Oh my God. A good callback. Madhavan, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here.

Madhavan Ramanujam (01:11:13):
Thank you so much, Lenny. Was a pleasure.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):
Same. Bye, everyone.

## Transcript

Marily Nika (00:00):
There is something called the shiny object trap, and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI." Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high-level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it.

Lenny (00:28):
Welcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Marily Nika. Marily teaches the most popular course on Maven on AI and product management. She's currently product lead at Meta focusing on Metaverse, avatars and identity. Prior to Meta, she was at Google for over eight years working on Google Glass, computer vision and machine learning around speech recognition. In our conversation, we touch on what PMs should be paying attention to when it comes to what's happening in AI. We talk about a bunch of resources that'll help you get started in the world of AI. How AI tools available today can already help you do your job better as a PM.

(01:12):
We also get relatively technical into what exactly is a model, how are models trained, all kinds of fun stuff like that. Enjoy this conversation with Marily Nika after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Lenny (01:53):
This episode is brought to you by EPPO. EPPO is a next-generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on EPPO to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth in stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPPO does all that and more, delivering results quickly and avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.

(02:41):
EPO lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPPO supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out EPPO at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.

(03:06):
Marilee, welcome to the podcast.

Marily Nika (03:08):
Thank you. Hello, thank you for having me.

Lenny (03:10):
It's very much my pleasure. We've interacted a little bit on Twitter. We've never actually talked before just right now. I've seen your course just all over the place, your course on AI and PM. And so I just thought it'd be really fun to have you on and help us all understand what the hell is happening in AI and especially AI and product. So thanks again for being here.

Marily Nika (03:33):
Yes, thank you. I'm really excited.

Lenny (03:36):
I would love your help as a former full-time PM/everyone listening that is a current PM, to help us understand what is going on with AI and product tech in general and tools in general. Move really fast, if you're trying to pay attention to what's happening, it's really hard to stay up to date on where things are going and it feels especially hard in AI.

(03:57):
It feels like there's just something coming out every day. And so I have a bunch of questions along these lines. The first is just like what media do you pay attention to stay on top of what's happening and what's new and what's interesting in the world of AI and machine learning?

Marily Nika (04:11):
As you know very well, subscribing to newsletters is something that's really impactful. And of course, I subscribe to your newsletter, but I am a big, big, big fan of the download by MIT Ecology Review or Atelier. And they're not necessarily AI-centric, but what I'm advocating for and what I'm telling people is that in the future everything will be AI by default. So even if you have something that's technology focused, you'll see a lot of AI starting to get sprinkled in there.

Lenny (04:40):
I want to follow up on what you just said there, but maybe we'll save it a little bit. Maybe going in a different direction first, what do you think is overhyped in the space of AI right now? What do you think is under hyped and undervalued?

Marily Nika (04:52):
I would like to discuss strategy between, which is both under hyped and over hyped at the same time. I was reading this article this morning where there are writers complaining and they're very, very fearful and they think, "Oh, writing online is going to die. Everything we've studying for is going to be replaced. They're going to take our jobs and so on." And I'm just like, "No, no, no. Charging PT and technology is enhancing our work. It's enhancing us. It does not steal from us." So that's what comes across right now. And there are other things that are under hype, but obviously ChatGPT is amazing. I'm using it day to day, but there are other things AI can do in an amazing manner.

(05:34):
I was reading a research article the other day that said that AI can now detect place. So lie detection, whether I is for security reasons or at work or anything like that is now possible. So I encourage people to go to these newsletters and go to these online blogs, 10 prints and so on, and just read what's happening. It's not all about chat reading, there's more, there's more about AI, but you should read a lot.

Lenny (05:58):
You mentioned that you use ChatGPT in your work life. Talk about that. What are you actually using it for?

Marily Nika (06:04):
Even when I'm at work and I am trying to come up with a nice mission statement, when we're PMs will come up with mission statements, it's just crucial part and it's where the core begins. You want to get people excited, you want to get people inspired. There is nothing I can write that's going to be as good as what ChatGPT looks like. So what I do is I literally go to ChatGPT and I say rewrite this mission statement from me and even the first try produces something which is fantastic, so that.

(06:34):
Number two, it helps me create user segments in a fantastic way. It will think of user segments that your mind wouldn't even go there, it just wouldn't go there. And it will provide the motivations, it will provide the pinpoints and you just come up with ideas as you read it. And then the last thing that it does is it provides ideas for you whether AI enhanced. So I just use a day-to-day, even [inaudible 00:07:00] day-to-day workflow, but I'm not making it do my job for me, I'm asking it after I have already had a mission in my head and what it is I want to do.

Lenny (07:10):
So is the way you're approaching it is you just put in, come up with a better mission statement then and then you give it your version of the mission statement?

Marily Nika (07:18):
Exactly.

Lenny (07:19):
Interesting. And you're saying that that comes up with a better mission statement than the one you had?

Marily Nika (07:25):
It's better because the mission statement is going to be read by all disciplines. It's not just going to be read by PMs that already have a lot of context and understand. It's going to be read by leadership, by junior people, by stakeholders, by other departments, by competitors. And you needed to be on Orient ending the words that are meant to be understood by everyone. Even a kid could understand and they would get inspired by you as well.

Lenny (07:49):
And then you also said he use it for personas. How do you actually frame that prompt with ChatGPT?

Marily Nika (07:55):
Let's say you're working for a specific product area and you know want to create some fitness band, so you would say something like, who would be interested in the fitness band that doesn't have a screen? And it will provide a bulleted list all of people like, hey, young professionals are that they're interested but don't have enough time. People that do not want to charge their wearables every day. Then the list goes on. It's just fantastic.

Lenny (08:24):
You were talking about how you think the future of AI is, it's the default and is what you mean there that it's basically baked into every product we use and it helps the user do better things, it helps the product work better. Is that what you mean or is it something else?

Marily Nika (08:39):
I believe that ballpark managers will be AI product managers in the future. And this is because we see all products needing to have a personalized experience, a recommender system that is actually good. I mean you cannot watch to Netflix, you cannot even watch a movie without needing that. After you watch White Lotus or Stranger Things, you will want something similar to watch. You're not going to want a romantic thing to be suggested or recommended to you.

(09:06):
Also, automation is another thing. We need to keep improving on society. We need to keep making technological advancements. You're not going to be able to do that if you don't have an AI centric view in every sector that you're working on.

Lenny (09:20):
When you say that every PM will be an AI PM is your thinking that you'll be using AI tools in your job as a PM or that you'll be building AI into everything you're building with? How do you think about that?

Marily Nika (09:35):
I think it's that you will need to get comfortable with having a partner that's a research scientist and you will need to understand that these people can produce a smart model. They'll be able to do some automation, some personalization, some recommendations on. In a lot of people, truly uncomfortable, a lot of people don't know how to approach the researchers. A lot of people don't like the uncertainty that research has. A lot of PMs are very, very used to, "Okay, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch, I'm going to do this, I'm going to launch." Whereas when you're working with research, it's more like we're going to try this and then in a year if it doesn't work out we're going to shut the written down and repeated completing [inaudible 00:10:17]. So I feel that if people get more used to uncertainty and research, things are going to be good in the end for them.

Lenny (10:28):
I thought you were comparing ChatGPT as a researcher you're working with, but you're actually saying people will have PhD researchers on their teams helping them build models into their product to make their product better. Is that what you're saying?

Marily Nika (10:43):
Correct. This is exactly what I'm-

Lenny (10:45):
Interesting.

Marily Nika (10:47):
And from a product perspective I can imagine like three bubbles in my head. So you want to find the intersection both something that's desirable by users, something that is going to be a viable business and something that is going to be feasible from a research scientist and technical perspective. And then when you have that, it's just going to be a capacity product for desktop launch that you can run with. So yeah, whenever I say researcher, research scientist that can produce an AI machine learning model.

Lenny (11:15):
Wow. Didn't think about how every cross-functional team might end up with a research scientist. Interesting, interesting. For PMs who are curious about learning how to do this stuff, what are a couple things that PMs today who have no experience with AI, what can they do to start learning how to build AI tooling into their products, understand what the hell's happening in the space of AI?

Marily Nika (11:40):
This is a good question and I guess the message I want to pass is you shouldn't be overwhelmed by these technologies if you don't have a technical background because you can learn these things and as a PM you'll never need to actually train or code. Also, even if you want to train, there are no code approaches for training models. But to answer the question, if you're working on any product, you can always sprinkle in a smarter feature. So you can make it more secure, you can personalize it, you can enhance it with fraud detection, you can make it more ethical. If it's healthcare, you can make it faster, you can make it more accurate. If it's shopping, you can create better accommodations. Basically anything where you can get data behind the behavior with users can be improved with AI.

(12:30):
So I guess it's all about changing the mindset of PMs. Taking a step back and just thinking about, okay, I have all this data that's just lying and sitting around what is it that I can do with it? I've been meeting PMs that said, "Oh, we're not collecting any data, we're [inaudible 00:12:46] dashboard." So even that is a huge first step towards AI. And then just start thinking about it, where you could deal, get a data science intern and just see what they are going to do. There's just so much people can do.

Lenny (13:00):
So say you want to start investing in some sort of model, some sort of AI within your team, you're saying maybe hire data scientists who can help you start to build something that you can start integrating. Is that your advice on the first step of once you start, you want to start getting serious about building some sort of AI component.

Marily Nika (13:19):
There is something called the shiny object trap and I'm always telling people, "Hey, don't do AI for the sake of doing AI". Make sure there is a problem there. Make sure there is a pain point that needs to be solved in a smart way. Once you have identified what that problem is and what that very, very high level solution is, then reach out and try to figure out how to actually implement it. And there's a definition I like giving. I usually say that the generalist PM helps their team and their company build and ship the right product. But the AI PM helps their team or company solve the right problem. So if you want to get into AI PM figure out what the problem is that you will get a data scientist to create a model for solving, but there needs to be a problem, there needs to be audience, there needs to be a user and a pin going for it.

Lenny (14:11):
What are signs that AI may not be a good approach to solving a problem? You said that, and this happened on a lot of my teams, oh we're going to build a really cool model, it's going to do something really smart in this case and it often ended up being a very low ROI investment and took six months to a year before you even knew what the hell what was happening. Do you have any thoughts on signs that maybe this isn't a place you should be putting a lot of time into AI versus this is definitely an opportunity. Yes, we should do this, invest a lot of time into this.

Marily Nika (14:42):
Don't do it for your MVP. It makes zero sense. Do not waste time of data scientists that can train models with using powerful machines that are going take weeks to train. This is because if you have an MVP and you just want to get buy-in for an idea or feature that may use AI in the future, take it, create a little figma prototype and just show it some users, just fake what the AI is going to be doing. So a lot of young early stage entrepreneurs reach out to me and they say, "Oh, should train this model to do this and that because we want to prove that there is a market." "No, do not use AI. You should use AI where you think you already have some data or data from an adjacent product that you feel you can leverage for your own product to create something that's meaningful, recommendation automation, what we talking about. But not for an MVP. Please people, this is my advice.

Lenny (15:46):
How much data do you think you need for AI ML to have a chance to contribute? You have a heuristic of if you have anything less than this, it's not going to work at all.

Marily Nika (15:59):
This is a good question and it honestly depends on what I'm what I'm trying to do. If you're trying to classify, if the photo is a category dog, obviously even if you have, I don't know like 15, 20 labeled photos, what's going to work. But if you want to create voice recognizers or complicated NLP applications, you're going to need thousands of [inaudible 00:16:19] of data. And this what's making this not be easy? AI systems are not easy to develop. There is a life cycle of a machine learning project and after scoping you need to figure out, "Oh god, how much data do we need? Where do I find this data as well, how much data?" Sometimes I've seen people synthesizing their own fake data just so that they can have something to train with and test their models. But the exact amount is hard to be defined, especially from a [inaudible 00:16:50]. I'm sure data scientists have a different opinion.

Lenny (16:53):
Yeah, my guess is most startups are going to have nowhere near enough data to build their own model and make it something really interesting. So do you have a thought on when it makes sense to try to build your own model, try to train your own GPT type thing versus use something that's already out there like say GPT or aJourney or all those guys.

Marily Nika (17:17):
If you are a big tech company and you're offering a service that is going to do speech or permission or then it's going to have their own tragedy, you want to use more data and more diverse data to train and retain and train because if you don't then your quality is going to be the same as every other companies. There are agencies that are selling data, packages of data, that are ready so you can get them and train your models. But the question is if everyone takes that exact dataset, then the quality that every single company is producing is going to be the exact same. So you do want to diversify, you do want to collect your own data. And I guess a good question from my prem perspective is when is the quality of your product good enough to lunch?

(18:08):
And that is a really interesting point because it's totally your responsibility as a PM to decide, "Okay, the recognition of whether this folder is a category dog is good enough for the users, it's like 70% accurate, 80% accurate, where is the bar, where do we launch?" And that's why I'm like the AI PM role is so cool because you have problems like that to solve that no one else was tackled before. So it's all on you.

Lenny (18:34):
We've thrown out these words model and we talk about training models. Do you have a good succinct explanation for what a model is for folks that aren't that technical and then just the general idea of training a model. What is a simple way to think of, here is what a model is.

Marily Nika (18:52):
So I have a three-year-old girl and I'm teaching hear about life and everything. So I was recently teaching her about the animals and you explain things to her once or twice, what the mammals is or rhino and so on. But you will end up training your kids brain by repeating the same information again. So you will say, "Hey, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like, here's what the rhino looks like, here's what an elephant looks like." And once you've done this enough times, then your kid will see an animal on the street and they'll be able to recognize and say, "Oh yeah, that's like rhino what we're talking about." This is exactly what a model is. The model is like a kid's brain. It has the ability to take an input, which means it has the ability to take an image and say, "Oh I recognize what this is. That looks like a rhino. But I'm 70% sure about this." So you will output the probability as well of the certainty.

Lenny (19:51):
And you said image, but it could be text for say in ChatGPT. In the future I imagine video there's also voice like whisper. That's an awesome explanation. Basically it's like trying to recreate the human brain is a nice way of thinking about it. And then training a model, can you talk about what that means?

Marily Nika (20:08):
The problems of training the model for example is providing a lot of images that are legal and say, "Hey, here's what card looks like, here's what it all looks like," and we're talking about thousands and thousands of data sets for this. And once you do this, there's a process where the model is just processing this information and it's learning, it's finding patterns through it and the patterns are not in the form of, oh if this is gray then this means this. No, it just learns in the smart brain how to identify specific things that we don't even understand. And then it's able to output the probability of whether photo is going to contain the cutter and top.

Lenny (20:49):
Just conceptually what is the output of the training? Is it code that is auto-generated with these decision trees and weights and things like that? Is it a database of weight? Just conceptually what is the output of a training that becomes a model? What's the simplest way to think about that?

Marily Nika (21:05):
So it's what it speaks. Speech is a great example. For example, I'm talking to a device which is like a home system and I say, "Hey, what is the weather like today?" This is going to take my folies and audio and it's going to process it and the output is going to be a transcription. So it's literally going to be text that corresponds to what I sent to it.

Lenny (21:24):
Thinking about the stuff you've worked on at Google, at Meta, anywhere else you've worked on, side projects even, what are some of the cooler applications of AI machine learning that you've worked on, contributed to, or even seen that you can talk about? I imagine there's a lot of sensitive stuff too going on.

Marily Nika (21:40):
One thing I want to talk about is the team I used to work for, Google, which was then the RVR team and they were working on an air glass and actually they had a video on last year's Google IO. They were able to have the Google glass on someone that spoke one language and then this other person was sat in front of them that spoke a different language and the glass will take as an input that audio that came from that other person and it will transcribe it, it will translate it and show it on the screen for that person in their language. So we're talking about the ability for this devices to unlock the borders of communication and that is not science fiction. This is what amazing and mind-blowing, there's no science fiction anymore. These things are real, the technology is here, it's just a matter of connecting the pieces to the puzzle in order to see them coming to life. So I think that one was one of the most impactful things I've ever seen.

Lenny (22:46):
I remember that demo and it was pretty incredible. Okay, so thinking a little more broadly, do you think ChatGPT or just say GPT four or GPT five, GPT six, do you think at some point this will replace product managers? Something I see on Twitter a lot. People are like, "Oh my god, product managements done. This thing made my product requirements document for me." Or you talked about how it makes your mission statement better. Do you think there's a place where PMs aren't necessary anymore?

Marily Nika (23:13):
Oh, absolutely not. As I said, it makes everything better. If anything it's going to free out time for me to do other things that are less tedious. For example, I am running so many projects and they only their peer [inaudible 00:23:27] and the peer [inaudible 00:23:28] have all these areas that are common across all of them. If I had a system that can actually write the continuous stuff for me so that I can focus on more strategic side of things, that would be incredible. It will make us smarter. If [inaudible 00:23:42], you will unlock new areas of product management that we haven't realized that, but are there.

Lenny (23:48):
Are there areas, do you think with your kind of vision of all PMs will be AI PMs, are there areas that you think PMs should invest more skill-wise or areas they should less focus on invest because say some machine learning model is going to do that for them.

Marily Nika (24:04):
I'd like to see people being less overwhelmed, less intimidated, less afraid to start learning how to code, how to train a little model on their own. This is because even if ChatGPT or this no code applications may be able to do this for us, it gives you a different approach, a different mindset, a different if you want confidence to know how things work. And here's a silly example, I was learning how to play the piano when I was young and when my teacher came in I was like, "Oh, I want to learn how to play this cool song." There were some songs that I really liked. And she said, "No, you need to start with a classical music," and I just hated it all the time. And I said, "Why do I have to do this?" Because she said, "If you learn the fundamentals and how you know where things started and the beginning of music, it's going to help you along the way to create music on your own if you want to." And she was right. I just loved it.

(25:00):
So it's the same with coding. I encourage people to just take an online course, understand more, get your hands dirty, pair up with someone else that's in the same boat as you because this is going to give you the skillset to understand how that tool that's going to help you in your day-to-day was even created in the first place instead of blindfoldedly distrusted to do your job.

Lenny (25:23):
This episode is brought to you by Pando, the always on employee performance platform. How much do you love the performance review process? Yeah, it's time consuming, subjective, bias and there's rarely any transparency. With the rapid shift to distributed work, it's a struggle to create the structure and transparency that you want to help your employees have the highest impact and growth in their careers. Pando is disrupting the old paradigm of performance management including a continuous employee-centric approach. So employees stay engaged, see their progression in real time and know exactly when and how they can level up. With Pando managers can leverage competency-based frameworks to effectively coach and develop their teams and align on consistent growth standards resulting in higher quality feedback and higher performing teams.

(26:21):
For someone that actually wants to do that and learn to code, which I love that advice, do you have any resources, places that you point people to for learning to code, getting started down that path?

Marily Nika (26:31):
It depends on what type of learner you are. There are some people that learn offline, so just go to Coursera, there are so many courses. There is an amazing one actually introduction to AI by Stanford that they're going to encourage people to take a look at. But I know that a lot of people don't like, don't have the time, don't have the discipline to actually take time off or after work, after they put their kids to sleep to just do it. So if you enjoy learning with others, if you enjoying being part of a team, if you enjoy going through a journey together, then I recommend these resources. So there is something called Career Foundry, which is a fantastic on coding school, General Assembly and then Coding Dojo.

(27:13):
I was actually give a talk, Ages of God Coding Dojo [inaudible 00:27:17] by Python, and all it takes is just a few weeks of your time and passion and just for you to roll up your sleeves and just realize that this is not intimidating and realize the benefits you can get by learning.

Lenny (27:31):
Awesome, thanks for sharing those. We'll include links in the show notes. Going back to a PM trying to become better in AI. If you think about a PM that's early in their career and wants to become a very strong AI PM. I know you have a whole course about this, which we can talk about now or later, whatever is easier, what should that PM be doing? We talked a bit about learn to code, maybe start playing with tools. What else do you suggest PMs that want to become really strong AI PMs do now and invest in?

Marily Nika (28:02):
So I do have a course that's coming up on February 6th on [inaudible 00:28:06], which is for current and aspiring product managers that want to build AI products. But I also have offline recordings. I have the same course on an offline basis on my website. I'd be happy to talk to you here, you already chat to me about this. What I feel people should understand is what it takes to manage an AI product. Of course people are very familiar with the stages of product development in general, but AI product development is different. As I mentioned before, sometimes you're actually managing the problem and not the product and you're trying to secure out if there is a problem that makes sense to be answered by a smart solution.

(28:45):
So it's a very interesting and more complicated process than regular product management. So number one, figure out how it differs from general product management. Number two, if you're already at the company that is actually having AR researchers and AI research scientists, I encourage people to just maybe talk to them and shadow them and spend an hour of their week just talking to them and experiencing what they're doing. This is going to open your mind, this is going to give you so much context as to what it is and the endless potential that you can identify there.

Lenny (29:22):
Awesome. And is there anything else you want to share from your course that you think might be interesting to folks?

Marily Nika (29:30):
So we talked about why it's awesome to be an AI PM, but I do want to call out that there are a few challenges that people need to be aware of. Number one, and I kind of mentioned it before, is the uncertainty. You may have been working on all of these incredible research and ideas in hypothesis, but then when you actually train the model, the results you may be getting may not be optimal, may not be answering the questions or the hypothesis that you actually had in mind. So that's number one. You need to be able to encourage the teams throughout this process because you're like the captain of the ship, you need to be the one that's cheerleading the team, making sure everyone keeps going.

(30:10):
Number two, you are going to have to [inaudible 00:30:15]. You are going to have to change the action in managing this from a leadership perspective can be tricky and it can be challenging.

(30:22):
Number three, we talked about data, but getting good data is hard. You may need to be creative, figure out ways for data collection that you never thought you'll do. You may get on the street and ask for people to actually contribute data for what it is you're doing. You need to be able to and willing to do everything. And the last thing is from a career trajectory, usually product managers get ahead the more they launch. But if you're in a research or if you're not going to launch as often, so you need to make sure to clarify with the hiring managers early on, "Hey, what does progress mean? How am I going to get a sense in a research work which is different than what I've been doing so far." So it's challenging but I always encourage people to flex different muscles and this is the zero to one muscle. The other thing is this crucial when it comes to product management.

Lenny (31:15):
This actually is a great segue to a question I definitely wanted to ask, which is around getting buy-in for investment at a company for ML. So there's sometimes all this energy for a zero to one, let's just try something, sometimes not, so maybe there's a two part question here. Do you have any advice on just getting buy-in for we want to try something with ML. It's going to take us six months to figure out if it's worth the effort, but we think there's something here. And then sometimes there's a lot of energy initially and then you get some win, like your search ranking's smarter and it's great.

(31:48):
But then maintaining that, having all these really expensive people working and just tweaking this model and continuing to make it smarter and a little more efficient, often it's hard to continue to get buy-in for that sort of team. Do you have any advice on initial buy-in, let's try something here, and then down the road just keeping a team going, trying to make this thing smarter and smarter.

Marily Nika (32:09):
People should know that there is an excellent source of inspiration and something that could kind of de-risk things, which is adjacent products. Maybe the company has already launched the product that has been successful, those AI firsts. And whenever I try to convince leadership about something that I want to do that's a big bet, I always use examples and I'm like, "Hey, this seemed crazy at the time, here's how they work. What I'm proposing is very similar to this crazy thing. And then I propose a little contingency plan, like hey, if that doesn't work out, here's the rollback plan, here's the maximum impact it will have done in a negative way, which is not going to be too much. And you kind of take it all on [inaudible 00:32:55].

(32:55):
And it's interesting because the more you work on this specific company, the more trust you get. And if the culture is such, then failing is going to be welcome. So a lot companies that welcome pain because you can just go ahead and do this sort of thing.

Lenny (33:09):
Do tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like most investments in ML are not successes and often not great uses of time. I'm curious if that changes with more tooling and more public models that people can plug into without having to build their own. I wonder if it becomes like, "Oh okay look we're put in three weeks, we'll get something really useful."

Marily Nika (33:27):
Exactly. And also the other thing, and I wanted to add on the question you asked before about hey how do you keep updated about new niche tech? We shouldn't underestimate academia and research blogs and there's a website called Archive where you can see new papers come up, because this is where... ChatGPT and [inaudible 00:33:49] used to be there for a long time, there was a lot of information on this sort thing. But it's now recent where we see that research scientists and research orgs are not as siloed as they used to be. So the more companies invest on staffing, this layer between productionizing and research, academic research, the more PMs you're going to add there, then the more you're going to see this bridge creating goods, products, [inaudible 00:34:20]. So sometimes you have amazing ideas by research scientists but you need a PM to take it and actually figure out ways to also monetize it.

(34:28):
That's the other thing, if you're a PM you need to come up with ways to actually be able to monetize and ChatGPT is now free for everyone. But I don't know if you saw, there was a signup forum that was coming around saying, "Hey, would you pay for this? What would be the minimum you pay? What would the maximum you pay? What would you like to see if you paid?" So having PMs breached the tap is crucial for companies to be able to take the research and actually come up with meaningful use cases for users.

Lenny (34:56):
I think they actually started charging the other day. I think it's like $40, $42 a month to start using it. I think people have been talking about on Twitter, I don't know if that's live yet. And then you talked about research papers, when I think that, I always think of Tyler Cohen, he has this awesome blog marginal revolution and he is really good at sharing insights from research papers that he's reading. So that's another place for folks to check out. He's just this really smart dude. He's really excited about AI and GPT in general and so he shares a lot of really interesting insights about it all. Segueing a little bit to your course, I have a couple questions about it. One is can you just talk about the broad framework of your course? How long is it, what do you learn, what are the workshops broadly? And then I have a couple follow up questions.

Marily Nika (35:39):
My course is three week long. It's meant for people that are either aspiring or current PMs that want to understand how to sprinkle in AI solutions or they wanted a full-time AI course. Week one is more about introduction, what the product development lifecycle is for regular products and how it differs for AIPN specifically. And then we talk about idea creation. How on earth do you come up with ideas? And I love what Steve Job said where he used to say, "Well, users don't know what they want until you show it to them." And that's exactly the mindset I want to invite two people and say, "Hey, people don't know how on earth you use AI." People will never have imagined ChatGPT can be what it is.

(36:26):
And then we take that and we dive deep and we talk about how on the earth do you productionize something like this? What are the different partners you're working with? What is a research scientist and how on the earth do you collaborate and how do you partner with them? How do you convince them what you have in mind for their precious research to be converted into a product? How on earth do you convince them to trust you and how do you influence them? And then at the end we're talking about how you actually will be able to pave your pathway PM all the way from interviewing for this role, from what resumes look like, and doing some mock interviews because the more you practice the better it is.

Lenny (37:03):
How many workshops are there through the course?

Marily Nika (37:05):
Nine workshops.

Lenny (37:06):
Nine workshops. Of the nine workshops, which of them are you finding is the most exciting, game-changing for someone, most interesting?

Marily Nika (37:15):
So throughout the duration of all these workshops, people have homework and they actually take home an exercise where they need to create and develop their own AI product end to end, and they can pair up with each other. By the way, there was this two students pair up and actually where I would raise funding, which is mind blowing to me, which is really great.

Lenny (37:15):
That's awesome.

Marily Nika (37:35):
But to continue, the most exciting part is when everyone at the great end are actually presenting their work and they're actually asking questions and getting feedback and they're just really excited and proud for what they created.

Lenny (37:48):
That's a good reminder of a lot of the learning that you do is just doing it, not just reading about it and following Twitter. Can you share any examples of stuff people built after the course?

Marily Nika (37:57):
Someone was able to actually, and I kid you not, create a little model that was able to take us an input x-rays that they found online and was able to tell us what was wrong if something was wrong with that patient. And it's just crazy to think that you can do that within three weeks. Obviously it was just by photos we were able to crawl online for x-rays. But the concept is there that you can build something like that, you can create it. And to take it a bit further, they wanted to create a lower recommender system and say, "Hey, we think this is what's wrong with you, here are the steps you should follow." Obviously we're not trying to play doctors or to pretend that or medical in any way, but being able to see that actually functioning is just, it's very impactful.

Lenny (38:48):
That's amazing. Do they already know how to code, do this team that built this thing?

Marily Nika (38:51):
They did not, but part of the course is to teach people the basics that you are going to need, prove it PM lens. And there are some no click tools as I mentioned that are going to allow you to drive and drop and train these models and input photos in it and be able to do it.

Lenny (39:07):
Can you mention those tools again because that is really interesting and it's just like a peek at your course, but if someone wanted to start building something like this, what are some of these tools they could check out?

Marily Nika (39:16):
One of the tools I would like to recommend to people is actually Auto ML. This is offered by World of Cloud and essentially it allows you to train high quality custom machine learning models, which minimal effort, you don't need to be able to code anything like that. You need to have a lot of photos and images that you have already corrected but it's not going to do the collection for you. And a great application I had to seen, there is actually a YouTube video about this. There was this company that actually had a lot of winter banks and what they did is in order to maintain these, they will actually have people manually have huge ladders and go take a look and see if everything was okay. So eventually they just [inaudible 00:39:59] drones and they had these drones fly on all of these machines and take photos of everything. And then they downloaded all these photos and they uploaded on Auto ML and they were able to see which ones needed maintenance and which did not.

(40:12):
And I think they reduced time from three weeks of work to a few hours of knowing which needed maintenance and just be able to send people there. So it's this type of thing that you can do on your own by applying this sort of tools.

Lenny (40:25):
Saying that tool is called Auto ML?

Marily Nika (40:28):
Yes, Auto ML.

Lenny (40:28):
Amazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Coming back to your course and maybe just a couple more questions. Can you just talk about what it takes to build a course like the course you built, how much time did it take you? How much work did it take? Anything that you want to share.

Marily Nika (40:43):
It treated creating like course like a product. This is what I did is, I came up with some hypothesis as to who the audience was and as to what they were looking to get out of it. And I started reaching out to people and I started saying, "Hey, first of all, would you like to learn from me? Second of all, what would you like to learn? What are the specific questions that you would need answered?" Because these are people that are working, people [inaudible 00:41:09] that have families. In order to take a break from all that you need to provide something to them that is meaningful. And there were quite a few activations. In the beginning I was focusing the course more for software engineers that wanted to become AI product managers. But then I realized, no, there are a lot of PMs that want to become AI product managers.

(41:31):
So I did a little online shift there. So what it takes is make sure you find the right audience, make sure to figure out what that audience wants, make sure to have the right duration. One week I find it too short. Two weeks, it'll still be rushed. Three weeks is excellent because you give the opportunity to everyone to present and to keep to know each other on an offline discord community, which is another important part. And then the last thing, you need to have a personal relationship with everyone. So I've messaged everyone, I've seen everyone's application. I met with some people as well just to make sure to answer any questions and concerns because I wanted to make sure that people were comfortable just trusting a stranger like me and paying them to provide knowledge for their course. So it took quite a few iterations, but I was able to get there and now I'm very, very happy about it and I recorded it offline as well for people.

Lenny (42:27):
Has anything had to change in this course? Maybe it's just as the last question, things are moving so fast. Is there anything you've had to rethink, redo since you first built it?

Marily Nika (42:35):
I actually added bonus sections and one bonus section was [inaudible 00:42:38] and how it was trained. This is because I started this new cohort in December and on day one the question I got is, what is this? How did it start? What is going on? How did they train it? So I added the dedicated section for it and I point people to it.

Lenny (42:52):
Amazing. Anything else that you'd like to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?

Marily Nika (42:58):
It was someone that recommended, I actually did a course and in the beginning I laughed and I said, "Wait, people would want to learn from me. Really?" And of course they did. And I'm teaching so many people. So what I want to tell people is don't underestimate this. Try creating your own courses as well. People may want to learn what you take for granted. For them it may be game changing, it can be life changing. So building courses is an amazing thing and we're living in the full [inaudible 00:43:30]. So the course is content, so go try this.

Lenny (43:33):
I find that teaching and at least crystallizing thoughts is one of the best ways to learn it yourself. I imagine you learned a lot about AI much more than even came into it with just putting it together into a course.

Marily Nika (43:44):
Absolutely. And I got some uncomfortable questions that I had no idea how to tackle. People on day one were like, how do I assess the tradeoffs between these two different months? And I had to figure out how to answer these things and how to incorporate them in my course. So learning from the students, learning from the course, learning from explaining is just so viable. So skills that we can get.

Lenny (44:07):
Well with that, we've reached our very, very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm going to go through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, share. We'll see how it all goes. Sound good?

Marily Nika (44:18):
Sounds good.

Lenny (44:19):
Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.

Marily Nika (44:22):
Inspired. It's all about how to create tech products people love.

Lenny (44:28):
Marty Kagan, right?

Marily Nika (44:29):
Yes, that's the one. Great.

Lenny (44:34):
Cool. Anything else? Or that's the one that comes to mind.

Marily Nika (44:35):
You Look Like a Thing and I Love You and I have it right here. It's a great thing, super, super cool. It's about how AI works and why it's making the world a weirder place. It's actually a very fun book. And there's one more, which is a book, a workbook I originally launched with Alana Karen and it's a workbook for women in tech trying to navigate working in tech. It's called Adventures of Women in Tech Workbook. So that's another thing that they want to shamelessly plug in.

Lenny (45:02):
Ah, that's a great choice to plug. Where can folks find that? Is that on Amazon?

Marily Nika (45:06):
Yeah, Amazon.

Lenny (45:07):
Amazing. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to?

Marily Nika (45:11):
I like Boz's podcast. I don't know if you're aware of it. Boz is the CEO of Facebook. He has a great podcast.

Lenny (45:19):
I have not heard it. I do know of Boz. I'll check that out. I didn't know he had a podcast. He had some great writing over the years. Maybe that's why he doesn't write it anymore. He has his podcast. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've loved?

Marily Nika (45:30):
Oh my God, The White Lotus. People were talking about this thing. I ended up just trying it out and me and my husband, we just binge watched the whole thing. Is just so different, so mind blowing, get you excited about going to Hawaii again. It's just really good.

Lenny (45:45):
Have you seen the second season?

Marily Nika (45:46):
I've seen it and it's so much better than the first, which is rare.

Lenny (45:50):
I agree. Awesome. Love that show. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask, and bonus point if it's AI related.

Marily Nika (45:57):
I love to ask people, how would you explain a database to a three year old? And I know it's kind of an AI, not everyone say ai, but I love asking it because people are thinking the [inaudible 00:46:11], like what did you just ask me? But it's so important to be able to explain things in a simple ring and have the storytelling to convince a kid and really explain technical terms to non-technical people.

Lenny (46:23):
Favorite AI based tool that you think people should check out.

Marily Nika (46:27):
Talk about ChatGPT, now I have this on ChatGPT, this is what comes to mind. Well, the Lensa app was pretty cool too, right? We all plugged in our [inaudible 00:46:36] and we're able to see what they would look like as fantastic heroes. I have to say, I tried being the mail version because it was so much cooler than the KingL version, so that's when I recommend to people, try the mail version.

Lenny (46:48):
That's fun. And they actually have pets now. That's what got me the download and pay for it. You can take pictures of your pets and they look so fun. That's like a killer feature right there. Good job Lensa. And the app is Lensa, right?

Marily Nika (47:01):
Yeah. [inaudible 00:47:02]

Lenny (47:02):
Amazing. Marily, thank you so much for spending time with me, sharing your wisdom. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?

Marily Nika (47:12):
Thank you so much. People can find me on Instagram. I also have a product channel on YouTube that you can check out. I just started it. I'm getting used to the whole process. I'm also kicking off a newsletter, just any social reach out and you'll see all my links.

Lenny (47:28):
How do they find the YouTube channel? How do they find the newsletter?

Marily Nika (47:31):
Typing Marily Nika.

Lenny (47:32):
Marily, thank you again for being here.
